    CONFIRMATION (Question [72])<br />
    <br />
    OF THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION (TWELVE ARTICLES)<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether confirmation is a sacrament?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Confirmation is not a sacrament.
    For sacraments derive their efficacy from the Divine institution, as stated
    above (<a href="TP064.html#TPQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>,
    <a href="TP064.html#TPQ64A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But we read nowhere of
    Confirmation being instituted by Christ. Therefore it is not a sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sacraments of the New Law were
    foreshadowed in the Old Law; thus the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++10%3A2-4"
      >1 Cor. 10:2-4</a
    >), that "all in Moses were baptized, in the cloud and in the sea; and did
    all eat the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink."
    But Confirmation was not foreshadowed in the old Testament. Therefore it is
    not a sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the sacraments are ordained unto man's
    salvation. But man can be saved without Confirmation: since children that
    are baptized, who die before being confirmed, are saved. Therefore
    Confirmation is not a sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, by all the sacraments of the Church, man
    is conformed to Christ, Who is the Author of the sacraments. But man cannot
    be conformed to Christ by Confirmation, since we read nowhere of Christ
    being confirmed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Melchiades wrote to the bishops of
    Spain: "Concerning the point on which you sought to be informed, i.e.
    whether the imposition of the bishop's hand were a greater sacrament than
    Baptism, know that each is a great sacrament."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The sacraments of the New Law are ordained unto
    special effects of grace: and therefore where there is a special effect of
    grace, there we find a special sacrament ordained for the purpose. But since
    sensible and material things bear a likeness to things spiritual and
    intelligible, from what occurs in the life of the body, we can perceive that
    which is special to the spiritual life. Now it is evident that in the life
    of the body a certain special perfection consists in man's attaining to the
    perfect age, and being able to perform the perfect actions of a man: hence
    the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++13%3A11"
      >1 Cor. 13:11</a
    >): "When I became a man, I put away the things of a child." And thence it
    is that besides the movement of generation whereby man receives life of the
    body, there is the movement of growth, whereby man is brought to the perfect
    age. So therefore does man receive spiritual life in Baptism, which is a
    spiritual regeneration: while in Confirmation man arrives at the perfect
    age, as it were, of the spiritual life. Hence Pope Melchiades says: "The
    Holy Ghost, Who comes down on the waters of Baptism bearing salvation in His
    flight, bestows at the font, the fulness of innocence; but in Confirmation
    He confers an increase of grace. In Baptism we are born again unto life;
    after Baptism we are strengthened." And therefore it is evident that
    Confirmation is a special sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Concerning the institution of this
    sacrament there are three opinions. Some (Alexander of Hales, Summa Theol.
    P. IV, Q. IX; St. Bonaventure, Sent. iv, D, 7) have maintained that this
    sacrament was instituted neither by Christ, nor by the apostles; but later
    in the course of time by one of the councils. Others (Pierre de Tarentaise,
    Sent. iv, D, 7) held that it was instituted by the apostles. But this cannot
    be admitted; since the institution of a new sacrament belongs to the power
    of excellence, which belongs to Christ alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And therefore we must say that Christ instituted this sacrament not by
    bestowing, but by promising it, according to Jn. 16:7: "If I go not, the
    Paraclete will not come to you, but if I go, I will send Him to you." And
    this was because in this sacrament the fulness of the Holy Ghost is
    bestowed, which was not to be given before Christ's Resurrection and
    Ascension; according to Jn. 7:39: "As yet the Spirit was not given, because
    Jesus was not yet glorified."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Confirmation is the sacrament of the
    fulness of grace: wherefore there could be nothing corresponding to it in
    the Old Law, since "the Law brought nothing to perfection" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++7%3A19"
      >Heb. 7:19</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1"
      >Question [65]</a
    >, <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), all the sacraments
    are in some way necessary for salvation: but some, so that there is no
    salvation without them; some as conducing to the perfection of salvation;
    and thus it is that Confirmation is necessary for salvation: although
    salvation is possible without it, provided it be not omitted out of
    contempt.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Those who receive Confirmation, which is
    the sacrament of the fulness of grace, are conformed to Christ, inasmuch as
    from the very first instant of His conception He was "full of grace and
    truth" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A14"
      >Jn. 1:14</a
    >). This fulness was made known at His Baptism, when "the Holy Ghost
    descended in a bodily shape... upon Him" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++3%3A22"
      >Lk. 3:22</a
    >). Hence (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++4%3A1"
      >Lk. 4:1</a
    >) it is written that "Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost, returned from the
    Jordan." Nor was it fitting to Christ's dignity, that He, Who is the Author
    of the sacraments, should receive the fulness of grace from a sacrament.<br />

    Whether chrism is a fitting matter for this sacrament?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that chrism is not a fitting matter for
    this sacrament. For this sacrament, as stated above (<a
      href="TP072.html#TPQ72A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 1), was instituted by Christ when He promised His disciples the Holy
    Ghost. But He sent them the Holy Ghost without their being anointed with
    chrism. Moreover, the apostles themselves bestowed this sacrament without
    chrism, by the mere imposition of hands: for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+8%3A17"
      >Acts 8:17</a
    >) that the apostles "laid their hands upon" those who were baptized, "and
    they received the Holy Ghost." Therefore chrism is not the matter of this
    sacrament: since the matter is essential to the sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Confirmation perfects, in a way, the
    sacrament of Baptism, as stated above (<a href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1"
      >Question [65]</a
    >, <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4): and so it ought to
    be conformed to it as perfection to the thing perfected. But the matter, in
    Baptism, is a simple element, viz. water. Therefore chrism, which is made of
    oil and balm, is not a fitting matter for this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, oil is used as the matter of this
    sacrament for the purpose of anointing. But any oil will do for anointing:
    for instance, oil made from nuts, and from anything else. Therefore not only
    olive oil should be used for this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it has been stated above (<a
      href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1"
      >Question [66]</a
    >, <a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that water is used as
    the matter of Baptism, because it is easily procured everywhere. But olive
    oil is not to be procured everywhere; and much less is balm. Therefore
    chrism, which is made of these, is not a fitting matter for this
    sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Registr. iv): "Let no priest
    dare to sign the baptized infants on the brow with the sacred chrism."
    Therefore chrism is the matter of this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Chrism is the fitting matter of this sacrament.
    For, as stated above (<a href="TP072.html#TPQ72A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), in
    this sacrament the fulness of the Holy Ghost is given for the spiritual
    strength which belongs to the perfect age. Now when man comes to perfect age
    he begins at once to have intercourse with others; whereas until then he
    lives an individual life, as it were, confined to himself. Now the grace of
    the Holy Ghost is signified by oil; hence Christ is said to be "anointed
    with the oil of gladness" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++44%3A8"
      >Ps. 44:8</a
    >), by reason of His being gifted with the fulness of the Holy Ghost.
    Consequently oil is a suitable matter of this sacrament. And balm is mixed
    with the oil, by reason of its fragrant odor, which spreads about: hence the
    Apostle says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++2%3A15"
      >2 Cor. 2:15</a
    >): "We are the good odor of Christ," etc. And though many other things be
    fragrant, yet preference is given to balm, because it has a special odor of
    its own, and because it confers incorruptibility: hence it is written
    (Ecclus. 24:21): "My odor is as the purest balm."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ, by the power which He exercises
    in the sacraments, bestowed on the apostles the reality of this sacrament,
    i.e. the fulness of the Holy Ghost, without the sacrament itself, because
    they had received "the first fruits of the Spirit" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A23"
      >Rm. 8:23</a
    >). Nevertheless, something of keeping with the matter of this sacrament was
    displayed to the apostles in a sensible manner when they received the Holy
    Ghost. For that the Holy Ghost came down upon them in a sensible manner
    under the form of fire, refers to the same signification as oil: except in
    so far as fire has an active power, while oil has a passive power, as being
    the matter and incentive of fire. And this was quite fitting: for it was
    through the apostles that the grace of the Holy Ghost was to flow forth to
    others. Again, the Holy Ghost came down on the apostles in the shape of a
    tongue. Which refers to the same signification as balm: except in so far as
    the tongue communicates with others by speech, but balm, by its odor.
    because, to wit, the apostles were filled with the Holy Ghost, as teachers
    of the Faith; but the rest of the believers, as doing that which gives
    edification to the faithful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In like manner, too, when the apostles imposed their hands, and when they
    preached, the fulness of the Holy Ghost came down under visible signs on the
    faithful, just as, at the beginning, He came down on the apostles: hence
    Peter said (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+11%3A15"
      >Acts 11:15</a
    >): "When I had begun to speak, the Holy Ghost fell upon them, as upon us
    also in the beginning." Consequently there was no need for sacramental
    sensible matter, where God sent sensible signs miraculously.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the apostles commonly made use of chrism in bestowing the
    sacrament, when such like visible signs were lacking. For Dionysius says
    (Eccl. Hier. iv): "There is a certain perfecting operation which our
    guides," i.e. the apostles, "call the sacrifice of Chrism."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Baptism is bestowed that spiritual life
    may be received simply; wherefore simple matter is fitting to it. But this
    sacrament is given that we may receive the fulness of the Holy Ghost, Whose
    operations are manifold, according to Wis. 7:22, "In her is the" Holy
    "Spirit... one, manifold"; and 1 Cor. 12:4, "There are diversities of
    graces, but the same Spirit." Consequently a compound matter is appropriate
    to this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> These properties of oil, by reason of
    which it symbolizes the Holy Ghost, are to be found in olive oil rather than
    in any other oil. In fact, the olive-tree itself, through being an
    evergreen, signifies the refreshing and merciful operation of the Holy
    Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, this oil is called oil properly, and is very much in use, wherever
    it is to be had. And whatever other liquid is so called, derives its name
    from its likeness to this oil: nor are the latter commonly used, unless it
    be to supply the want of olive oil. Therefore it is that this oil alone is
    used for this and certain other sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Baptism is the sacrament of absolute
    necessity; and so its matter should be at hand everywhere. But it is enough
    that the matter of this sacrament, which is not of such great necessity, be
    easily sent to all parts of the world.<br />

    Whether it is essential to this sacrament that the chrism which is its
    matter be previously consecrated by a bishop?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it is not essential to this
    sacrament, that the chrism, which is its matter, be previously consecrated
    by a bishop. For Baptism which bestows full remission of sins is not less
    efficacious than this sacrament. But, though the baptismal water receives a
    kind of blessing before being used for Baptism; yet this is not essential to
    the sacrament: since in a case of necessity it can be dispensed with.
    Therefore neither is it essential to this sacrament that the chrism should
    be previously consecrated by a bishop.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the same should not be consecrated
    twice. But the sacramental matter is sanctified, in the very conferring of
    the sacrament, by the form of words wherein the sacrament is bestowed; hence
    Augustine says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.): "The word is added to the element,
    and this becomes a sacrament." Therefore the chrism should not be
    consecrated before this sacrament is given.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every consecration employed in the
    sacraments is ordained to the bestowal of grace. But the sensible matter
    composed of oil and balm is not receptive of grace. Therefore it should not
    be consecrated.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Innocent I says (Ep. ad Decent.):
    "Priests, when baptizing, may anoint the baptized with chrism, previously
    consecrated by a bishop: but they must not sign the brow with the same oil;
    this belongs to the bishop alone, when he gives the Paraclete." Now this is
    done in this sacrament. Therefore it is necessary for this sacrament that
    its matter be previously consecrated by a bishop.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The entire sanctification of the sacraments is
    derived from Christ, as stated above (<a href="TP064.html#TPQ64OUTP1"
      >Question [64]</a
    >, <a href="TP064.html#TPQ64A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But it must be
    observed that Christ did use certain sacraments having a corporeal matter,
    viz. Baptism, and also the Eucharist. And consequently, from Christ's very
    act in using them, the matter of these sacraments received a certain
    aptitude to the perfection of the sacrament. Hence Chrysostom (Chromatius,
    In Matth. 3:15) says that "the waters of Baptism could never wash away the
    sins of believers, had they not been sanctified by contact with our Lord's
    body." And again, our Lord Himself "taking bread... blessed... and in like
    manner the chalice" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++26%3A26,27;+Lk++22:19,+20"
      >Mt. 26:26,27; Lk. 22:19, 20</a
    >). For this reason there is no need for the matter of these sacraments to
    be blessed previously, since Christ's blessing is enough. And if any
    blessing be used, it belongs to the solemnity of the sacrament, not to its
    essence. But Christ did not make use of visible anointings, so as not to
    slight the invisible unction whereby He was "anointed above" His "fellows"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++44%3A8">Ps. 44:8</a>).
    And hence both chrism, and the holy oil, and the oil of the sick are blessed
    before being put to sacramental use. This suffices for the reply to the
    First Objection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Each consecration of the chrism has not
    the same object. For just as an instrument derives instrumental power in two
    ways, viz. when it receives the form of an instrument, and when it is moved
    by the principal agent; so too the sacramental matter needs a twofold
    sanctification, by one of which it becomes fit matter for the sacrament,
    while by the other it is applied to the production of the effect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Corporeal matter is receptive of grace,
    not so as to be the subject of grace, but only as the instrument of grace,
    as explained above (<a href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). And this sacramental
    matter is consecrated, either by Christ, or by a bishop, who, in the Church,
    impersonates Christ.<br />

    Whether the proper form of this sacrament is: "I sign thee with the sign of
    the cross," etc.?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the proper form of this sacrament
    is not: "I sign thee with the sign of the cross, I confirm thee with the
    chrism of salvation, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
    Holy Ghost. Amen." For the use of the sacraments is derived from Christ and
    the apostles. But neither did Christ institute this form, nor do we read of
    the apostles making use of it. Therefore it is not the proper form of this
    sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as the sacrament is the same
    everywhere, so should the form be the same: because everything has unity,
    just as it has being, from its form. But this form is not used by all: for
    some say: "I confirm thee with the chrism of sanctification." Therefore the
    above is not the proper form of this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this sacrament should be conformed to
    Baptism, as the perfect to the thing perfected, as stated above (<a
      href="TP072.html#TPQ72A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, Objection [2]). But in the form of Baptism no mention is made of signing
    the character; nor again of the cross of Christ, though in Baptism man dies
    with Christ, as the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++6%3A3-8"
      >Rm. 6:3-8</a
    >); nor of the effect which is salvation, though Baptism is necessary for
    salvation. Again, in the baptismal form, only one action is included; and
    the person of the baptizer is expressed in the words: "I baptize thee,
    whereas the contrary is to be observed in the above form." Therefore this is
    not the proper form of this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Is the authority of the Church, who always
    uses this form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The above form is appropriate to this
    sacrament. For just as the form of a natural thing gives it its species, so
    a sacramental form should contain whatever belongs to the species of the
    sacrament. Now as is evident from what has been already said (<a
      href="TP072.html#TPQ72ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,2), in this sacrament the Holy Ghost is given for strength in the
    spiritual combat. Wherefore in this sacrament three things are necessary;
    and they are contained in the above form. The first of these is the cause
    conferring fulness of spiritual strength which cause is the Blessed Trinity:
    and this is expressed in the words, "In the name of the Father," etc. The
    second is the spiritual strength itself bestowed on man unto salvation by
    the sacrament of visible matter; and this is referred to in the words, "I
    confirm thee with the chrism of salvation." The third is the sign which is
    given to the combatant, as in a bodily combat: thus are soldiers marked with
    the sign of their leaders. And to this refer the words, "I sign thee with
    the sign of the cross," in which sign, to wit, our King triumphed (cf. Col.
    2:15).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP072.html#TPQ72A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, ad 1), sometimes the effect of this sacrament, i.e. the fulness of the
    Holy Ghost, was given through the ministry of the apostles, under certain
    visible signs, wrought miraculously by God, Who can bestow the sacramental
    effect, independently of the sacrament. In these cases there was no need for
    either the matter or the form of this sacrament. On the other hand,
    sometimes they bestowed this sacrament as ministers of the sacraments. And
    then, they used both matter and form according to Christ's command. For the
    apostles, in conferring the sacraments, observed many things which are not
    handed down in those Scriptures that are in general use. Hence Dionysius
    says at the end of his treatise on the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy (chap. vii):
    "It is not allowed to explain in writing the prayers which are used in the
    sacraments, and to publish their mystical meaning, or the power which,
    coming from God, gives them their efficacy; we learn these things by holy
    tradition without any display,"* i.e. secretly. [*The passage quoted in the
    text of the Summa differs slightly from the above, which is translated
    directly from the works of Dionysius.] Hence the Apostle, speaking of the
    celebration of the Eucharist, writes (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++11%3A34"
      >1 Cor. 11:34</a
    >): "The rest I will set in order, when I come."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Holiness is the cause of salvation.
    Therefore it comes to the same whether we say "chrism of salvation" or "of
    sanctification."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Baptism is the regeneration unto the
    spiritual life, whereby man lives in himself. And therefore in the baptismal
    form that action alone is expressed which refers to the man to be
    sanctified. But this sacrament is ordained not only to the sanctification of
    man in himself, but also to strengthen him in his outward combat.
    Consequently not only is mention made of interior sanctification, in the
    words, "I confirm thee with the chrism of salvation": but furthermore man is
    signed outwardly, as it were with the standard of the cross, unto the
    outward spiritual combat; and this is signified by the words, "I sign thee
    with the sign of the cross."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But in the very word "baptize," which signifies "to cleanse," we can
    understand both the matter, which is the cleansing water, and the effect,
    which is salvation. Whereas these are not understood by the word "confirm";
    and consequently they had to be expressed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, it has been said above (<a href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1"
      >Question [66]</a
    >, <a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 1) that the pronoun
    "I" is not necessary to the Baptismal form, because it is included in the
    first person of the verb. It is, however, included in order to express the
    intention. But this does not seem so necessary in Confirmation, which is
    conferred only by a minister of excellence, as we shall state later on (<a

    Whether the sacrament of Confirmation imprints a character?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the sacrament of Confirmation does
    not imprint a character. For a character means a distinctive sign. But a man
    is not distinguished from unbelievers by the sacrament of Confirmation, for
    this is the effect of Baptism; nor from the rest of the faithful, because
    this sacrament is ordained to the spiritual combat, which is enjoined to all
    the faithful. Therefore a character is not imprinted in this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it was stated above (<a
      href="TP063.html#TPQ63OUTP1"
      >Question [63]</a
    >, <a href="TP063.html#TPQ63A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) that a character is a
    spiritual power. Now a power must be either active or passive. But the
    active power in the sacraments is conferred by the sacrament of order: while
    the passive or receptive power is conferred by the sacrament of Baptism.
    Therefore no character is imprinted by the sacrament of Confirmation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in circumcision, which is a character of
    the body, no spiritual character is imprinted. But in this sacrament a
    character is imprinted on the body, when the sign of the cross is signed
    with chrism on man's brow. Therefore a spiritual character is not imprinted
    by this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A character is imprinted in every sacrament
    that is not repeated. But this sacrament is not repeated: for Gregory II
    says (Ep. iv ad Bonifac.): "As to the man who was confirmed a second time by
    a bishop, such a repetition must be forbidden." Therefore a character is
    imprinted in Confirmation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP063.html#TPQ63OUTP1"
      >Question [63]</a
    >, <a href="TP063.html#TPQ63A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), a character is a
    spiritual power ordained to certain sacred actions. Now it has been said
    above (<a href="TP072.html#TPQ72A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that, just as Baptism is
    a spiritual regeneration unto Christian life, so also is Confirmation a
    certain spiritual growth bringing man to perfect spiritual age. But it is
    evident, from a comparison with the life of the body, that the action which
    is proper to man immediately after birth, is different from the action which
    is proper to him when he has come to perfect age. And therefore by the
    sacrament of Confirmation man is given a spiritual power in respect of
    sacred actions other than those in respect of which he receives power in
    Baptism. For in Baptism he receives power to do those things which pertain
    to his own salvation, forasmuch as he lives to himself: whereas in
    Confirmation he receives power to do those things which pertain to the
    spiritual combat with the enemies of the Faith. This is evident from the
    example of the apostles, who, before they received the fulness of the Holy
    Ghost, were in the "upper room... persevering... in prayer" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+1%3A13,14"
      >Acts 1:13,14</a
    >); whereas afterwards they went out and feared not to confess their faith
    in public, even in the face of the enemies of the Christian Faith. And
    therefore it is evident that a character is imprinted in the sacrament of
    Confirmation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All have to wage the spiritual combat
    with our invisible enemies. But to fight against visible foes, viz. against
    the persecutors of the Faith, by confessing Christ's name, belongs to the
    confirmed, who have already come spiritually to the age of virility,
    according to 1 Jn. 2:14: "I write unto you, young men, because you are
    strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked
    one." And therefore the character of Confirmation is a distinctive sign, not
    between unbelievers and believers, but between those who are grown up
    spiritually and those of whom it is written: "As new-born babes" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Pt++2%3A2"
      >1 Pt. 2:2</a
    >).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All the sacraments are protestations of
    faith. Therefore just as he who is baptized receives the power of testifying
    to his faith by receiving the other sacraments; so he who is confirmed
    receives the power of publicly confessing his faith by words, as it were "ex
    officio."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sacraments of the Old Law are called
    "justice of the flesh" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++9%3A10"
      >Heb. 9:10</a
    >) because, to wit, they wrought nothing inwardly. Consequently in
    circumcision a character was imprinted in the body only, but not in the
    soul. But in Confirmation, since it is a sacrament of the New Law, a
    spiritual character is imprinted at the same time, together with the bodily
    character.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the character of Confirmation presupposes of necessity, the
    baptismal character?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the character of Confirmation does
    not presuppose, of necessity, the baptismal character. For the sacrament of
    Confirmation is ordained to the public confession of the Faith of Christ.
    But many, even before Baptism, have publicly confessed the Faith of Christ
    by shedding their blood for the Faith. Therefore the character of
    Confirmation does not presuppose the baptismal character.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is not related of the apostles that
    they were baptized; especially, since it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++4%3A2"
      >Jn. 4:2</a
    >) that Christ "Himself did not baptize, but His disciples." Yet afterwards
    they were confirmed by the coming of the Holy Ghost. Therefore, in like
    manner, others can be confirmed before being baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+10%3A44-48"
      >Acts 10:44-48</a
    >) that "while Peter was yet speaking... the Holy Ghost fell on all them
    that heard the word... and [Vulg.: 'for'] they heard them speaking with
    tongues": and afterwards "he commanded them to be baptized." Therefore
    others with equal reason can be confirmed before being baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Rabanus says (De Instit. Cleric. i): "Lastly
    the Paraclete is given to the baptized by the imposition of the high
    priest's hands, in order that the baptized may be strengthened by the Holy
    Ghost so as to publish his faith."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The character of Confirmation, of necessity
    supposes the baptismal character: so that, in effect, if one who is not
    baptized were to be confirmed, he would receive nothing, but would have to
    be confirmed again after receiving Baptism. The reason of this is that,
    Confirmation is to Baptism as growth to birth, as is evident from what has
    been said above (<a href="TP072.html#TPQ72A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now it is clear that no
    one can be brought to perfect age unless he be first born: and in like
    manner, unless a man be first baptized, he cannot receive the sacrament of
    Confirmation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Divine power is not confined to the
    sacraments. Hence man can receive spiritual strength to confess the Faith of
    Christ publicly, without receiving the sacrament of Confirmation: just as he
    can also receive remission of sins without Baptism. Yet, just as none
    receive the effect of Baptism without the desire of Baptism; so none receive
    the effect of Confirmation, without the desire of Confirmation. And man can
    have this even before receiving Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (Ep. cclxv), from our
    Lord's words, "'He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his feet' (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++13%3A10"
      >Jn. 13:10</a
    >), we gather that Peter and Christ's other disciples had been baptized,
    either with John's Baptism, as some think; or with Christ's, which is more
    credible. For He did not refuse to administer Baptism, so as to have
    servants by whom to baptize others."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who heard the preaching of Peter
    received the effect of Confirmation miraculously: but not the sacrament of
    Confirmation. Now it has been stated (ad 1) that the effect of Confirmation
    can be bestowed on man before Baptism, whereas the sacrament cannot. For
    just as the effect of Confirmation, which is spiritual strength, presupposes
    the effect of Baptism, which is justification, so the sacrament of
    Confirmation presupposes the sacrament of Baptism.<br />

    Whether sanctifying grace is bestowed in this sacrament?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sanctifying grace is not bestowed
    in this sacrament. For sanctifying grace is ordained against sin. But this
    sacrament, as stated above (<a href="TP072.html#TPQ72A6THEP1">Article [6]</a
    >) is given only to the baptized, who are cleansed from sin. Therefore
    sanctifying grace is not bestowed in this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sinners especially need sanctifying
    grace, by which alone can they be justified. If, therefore, sanctifying
    grace is bestowed in this sacrament, it seems that it should be given to
    those who are in sin. And yet this is not true.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there can only be one species of
    sanctifying grace, since it is ordained to one effect. But two forms of the
    same species cannot be in the same subject. Since, therefore, man receives
    sanctifying grace in Baptism, it seems that sanctifying grace is not
    bestowed in Confirmation, which is given to none but the baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Melchiades says (Ep. ad Episc. Hispan.):
    "The Holy Ghost bestows at the font the fulness of innocence; but in
    Confirmation He confers an increase of grace."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In this sacrament, as stated above (<a
      href="TP072.html#TPQ72ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,4), the Holy Ghost is given to the baptized for strength: just as He was
    given to the apostles on the day of Pentecost, as we read in Acts 2; and
    just as He was given to the baptized by the imposition of the apostles'
    hands, as related in Acts 8:17. Now it has been proved in the FP, Question
    [43], Article [3] that the Holy Ghost is not sent or given except with
    sanctifying grace. Consequently it is evident that sanctifying grace is
    bestowed in this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sanctifying grace does indeed take away
    sin; but it has other effects also, because it suffices to carry man through
    every step as far as eternal life. Hence to Paul was it said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++12%3A9"
      >2 Cor. 12:9</a
    >): "My grace is sufficient for thee": and he says of himself (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A10"
      >1 Cor. 15:10</a
    >): "By the grace of God I am what I am." Therefore sanctifying grace is
    given not only for the remission of sin, but also for growth and stability
    in righteousness. And thus is it bestowed in this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as appears from its very name,
    this sacrament is given in order "to confirm" what it finds already there.
    And consequently it should not be given to those who are not in a state of
    grace. For this reason, just as it is not given to the unbaptized, so
    neither should it be given to the adult sinners, except they be restored by
    Penance. Wherefore was it decreed in the Council of Orleans (Can. iii) that
    "men should come to Confirmation fasting; and should be admonished to
    confess their sins first, so that being cleansed they may be able to receive
    the gift of the Holy Ghost." And then this sacrament perfects the effects of
    Penance, as of Baptism: because by the grace which he has received in this
    sacrament, the penitent will obtain fuller remission of his sin. And if any
    adult approach, being in a state of sin of which he is not conscious or for
    which he is not perfectly contrite, he will receive the remission of his
    sins through the grace bestowed in this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1"
      >Question [62]</a
    >, <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the sacramental grace
    adds to the sanctifying grace taken in its wide sense, something that
    produces a special effect, and to which the sacrament is ordained. If, then,
    we consider, in its wide sense, the grace bestowed in this sacrament, it
    does not differ from that bestowed in Baptism, but increases what was
    already there. On the other hand, if we consider it as to that which is
    added over and above, then one differs in species from the other.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether this sacrament should be given to all?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that this sacrament should not be given
    to all. For this sacrament is given in order to confer a certain excellence,
    as stated above (<a href="TP072.html#TPQ72A11THEP1">Article [11]</a>, ad 2).
    But all are not suited for that which belongs to excellence. Therefore this
    sacrament should not be given to all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by this sacrament man advances
    spiritually to perfect age. But perfect age is inconsistent with childhood.
    Therefore at least it should not be given to children.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as Pope Melchiades says (Ep. ad Episc.
    Hispan.) "after Baptism we are strengthened for the combat." But women are
    incompetent to combat, by reason of the frailty of their sex. Therefore
    neither should women receive this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Pope Melchiades says (Ep. ad Episc.
    Hispan.): "Although the benefit of Regeneration suffices for those who are
    on the point of death, yet the graces of Confirmation are necessary for
    those who are to conquer. Confirmation arms and strengthens those to whom
    the struggles and combats of this world are reserved. And he who comes to
    die, having kept unsullied the innocence he acquired in Baptism, is
    confirmed by death; for after death he can sin no more." Therefore this
    sacrament should not be given to those who are on the point of death: and so
    it should not be given to all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+2%3A2"
      >Acts 2:2</a
    >) that the Holy Ghost in coming, "filled the whole house," whereby the
    Church is signified; and afterwards it is added that "they were all filled
    with the Holy Ghost." But this sacrament is given that we may receive that
    fulness. Therefore it should be given to all who belong to the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP072.html#TPQ72A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), man is spiritually advanced by this sacrament to perfect age. Now the
    intention of nature is that everyone born corporally, should come to perfect
    age: yet this is sometimes hindered by reason of the corruptibility of the
    body, which is forestalled by death. But much more is it God's intention to
    bring all things to perfection, since nature shares in this intention
    inasmuch as it reflects Him: hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++32%3A4"
      >Dt. 32:4</a
    >): "The works of God are perfect." Now the soul, to which spiritual birth
    and perfect spiritual age belong, is immortal; and just as it can in old age
    attain to spiritual birth, so can it attain to perfect (spiritual) age in
    youth or childhood; because the various ages of the body do not affect the
    soul. Therefore this sacrament should be given to all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This sacrament is given in order to
    confer a certain excellence, not indeed, like the sacrament of order, of one
    man over another, but of man in regard to himself: thus the same man, when
    arrived at maturity, excels himself as he was when a boy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above, the age of the body
    does not affect the soul. Consequently even in childhood man can attain to
    the perfection of spiritual age, of which it is written (Wis. 4:8):
    "Venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of
    years." And hence it is that many children, by reason of the strength of the
    Holy Ghost which they had received, fought bravely for Christ even to the
    shedding of their blood.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Chrysostom says (Hom. i De Machab.),
    "in earthly contests fitness of age, physique and rank are required; and
    consequently slaves, women, old men, and boys are debarred from taking part
    therein. But in the heavenly combats, the Stadium is open equally to all, to
    every age, and to either sex." Again, he says (Hom. de Militia Spirit.): "In
    God's eyes even women fight, for many a woman has waged the spiritual
    warfare with the courage of a man. For some have rivaled men in the courage
    with which they have suffered martyrdom; and some indeed have shown
    themselves stronger than men." Therefore this sacrament should be given to
    women.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As we have already observed, the soul,
    to which spiritual age belongs, is immortal. Wherefore this sacrament should
    be given to those on the point of death, that they may be seen to be perfect
    at the resurrection, according to Eph. 4:13: "Until we all meet into the
    unity of faith... unto the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ." And
    hence Hugh of St. Victor says (De Sacram. ii), "It would be altogether
    hazardous, if anyone happened to go forth from this life without being
    confirmed": not that such a one would be lost, except perhaps through
    contempt; but that this would be detrimental to his perfection. And
    therefore even children dying after Confirmation obtain greater glory, just
    as here below they receive more grace. The passage quoted is to be taken in
    the sense that, with regard to the dangers of the present combat, those who
    are on the point of death do not need this sacrament.<br />

    Whether this sacrament should be given to man on the forehead?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that this sacrament should not be given
    to man on the forehead. For this sacrament perfects Baptism, as stated above
    (<a href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4). But the sacrament of
    Baptism is given to man over his whole body. Therefore this sacrament should
    not be given on the forehead only.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, this sacrament is given for spiritual
    strength, as stated above (<a href="TP072.html#TPQ72ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a
    >,2,4). But spiritual strength is situated principally in the heart.
    Therefore this sacrament should be given over the heart rather than on the
    forehead.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this sacrament is given to man that he
    may freely confess the faith of Christ. But "with the mouth, confession is
    made unto salvation," according to Rm. 10:10. Therefore this sacrament
    should be given about the mouth rather than on the forehead.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Rabanus says (De Instit. Cleric. i): "The
    baptized is signed by the priest with chrism on the top of the head, but by
    the bishop on the forehead."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP072.html#TPQ72ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,4), in this sacrament man receives the Holy Ghost for strength in the
    spiritual combat, that he may bravely confess the Faith of Christ even in
    face of the enemies of that Faith. Wherefore he is fittingly signed with the
    sign of the cross on the forehead, with chrism, for two reasons. First,
    because he is signed with the sign of the cross, as a soldier with the sign
    of his leader, which should be evident and manifest. Now, the forehead,
    which is hardly ever covered, is the most conspicuous part of the human
    body. Wherefore the confirmed is anointed with chrism on the forehead, that
    he may show publicly that he is a Christian: thus too the apostles after
    receiving the Holy Ghost showed themselves in public, whereas before they
    remained hidden in the upper room.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, because man is hindered from freely confessing Christ's name, by
    two things---by fear and by shame. Now both these things betray themselves
    principally on the forehead on account of the proximity of the imagination,
    and because the (vital) spirits mount directly from the heart to the
    forehead: hence "those who are ashamed, blush, and those who are afraid,
    pale" (Ethic. iv). And therefore man is signed with chrism, that neither
    fear nor shame may hinder him from confessing the name of Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By baptism we are regenerated unto
    spiritual life, which belongs to the whole man. But in Confirmation we are
    strengthened for the combat; the sign of which should be borne on the
    forehead, as in a conspicuous place.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The principle of fortitude is in the
    heart, but its sign appears on the forehead: wherefore it is written (Ezech.
    3:8): "Behold I have made... thy forehead harder than their foreheads."
    Hence the sacrament of the Eucharist, whereby man is confirmed in himself,
    belongs to the heart, according to Ps. 103:15: "That bread may strengthen
    man's heart." But the sacrament of Confirmation is required as a sign of
    fortitude against others; and for this reason it is given on the
    forehead.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This sacrament is given that we may
    confess freely: but not that we may confess simply, for this is also the
    effect of Baptism. And therefore it should not be given on the mouth, but on
    the forehead, where appear the signs of those passions which hinder free
    confession.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether he who is confirmed needs one to stand* for him? [*Literally, "to
    hold him"]<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that he who is confirmed needs no one to
    stand for him. For this sacrament is given not only to children but also to
    adults. But adults can stand for themselves. Therefore it is absurd that
    someone else should stand for them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he that belongs already to the Church,
    has free access to the prince of the Church, i.e. the bishop. But this
    sacrament, as stated above (<a href="TP072.html#TPQ72A6THEP1">Article [6]</a
    >), is given only to one that is baptized, who is already a member of the
    Church. Therefore it seems that he should not be brought by another to the
    bishop in order to receive this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this sacrament is given for spiritual
    strength, which has more vigor in men than in women, according to Prov.
    31:10: "Who shall find a valiant woman?" Therefore at least a woman should
    not stand for a man in confirmation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Are the following words of Pope Innocent,
    which are to be found in the Decretals (XXX,
    <a href="TP004.html#TPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>): "If anyone raise the
    children of another's marriage from the sacred font, or stand for them in
    Confirmation," etc. Therefore, just as someone is required as sponsor of one
    who is baptized, so is someone required to stand for him who is to be
    confirmed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP072.html#TPQ72ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,4,9), this sacrament is given to man for strength in the spiritual combat.
    Now, just as one newly born requires someone to teach him things pertaining
    to ordinary conduct, according to Heb. 12:9: "We have had fathers of our
    flesh, for instructors, and we obeyed [Vulg.: 'reverenced']" them; so they
    who are chosen for the fight need instructors by whom they are informed of
    things concerning the conduct of the battle, and hence in earthly wars,
    generals and captains are appointed to the command of the others. For this
    reason he also who receives this sacrament, has someone to stand for him,
    who, as it were, has to instruct him concerning the fight.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, since this sacrament bestows on man the perfection of spiritual
    age, as stated above (<a href="TP072.html#TPQ72ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,5),
    therefore he who approaches this sacrament is upheld by another, as being
    spiritually a weakling and a child.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although he who is confirmed, be adult
    in body, nevertheless he is not yet spiritually adult.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Though he who is baptized is made a
    member of the Church, nevertheless he is not yet enrolled as a Christian
    soldier. And therefore he is brought to the bishop, as to the commander of
    the army, by one who is already enrolled as a Christian soldier. For one who
    is not yet confirmed should not stand for another in Confirmation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> According to Col. 3 *(<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A28"
      >Gal. 3:28</a
    >), "in Christ Jesus there is neither male nor female." Consequently it
    matters not whether a man or a woman stand for one who is to be
    confirmed.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether only a bishop can confer this sacrament?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that not only a bishop can confer this
    sacrament. For Gregory (Regist. iv), writing to Bishop Januarius, says: "We
    hear that some were scandalized because we forbade priests to anoint with
    chrism those who have been baptized. Yet in doing this we followed the
    ancient custom of our Church: but if this trouble some so very much we
    permit priests, where no bishop is to be had, to anoint the baptized on the
    forehead with chrism." But that which is essential to the sacraments should
    not be changed for the purpose of avoiding scandal. Therefore it seems that
    it is not essential to this sacrament that it be conferred by a bishop.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sacrament of Baptism seems to be
    more efficacious than the sacrament of Confirmation: since it bestows full
    remission of sins, both as to guilt and as to punishment, whereas this
    sacrament does not. But a simple priest, in virtue of his office, can give
    the sacrament of Baptism: and in a case of necessity anyone, even without
    orders, can baptize. Therefore it is not essential to this sacrament that it
    be conferred by a bishop.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the top of the head, where according to
    medical men the reason is situated (i.e. the "particular reason," which is
    called the "cogitative faculty"), is more noble than the forehead, which is
    the site of the imagination. But a simple priest can anoint the baptized
    with chrism on the top of the head. Therefore much more can he anoint them
    with chrism on the forehead, which belongs to this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Eusebius (Ep. iii ad Ep. Tusc.) says:
    "The sacrament of the imposition of the hand should be held in great
    veneration, and can be given by none but the high priests. Nor is it related
    or known to have been conf erred in apostolic times by others than the
    apostles themselves; nor can it ever be either licitly or validly performed
    by others than those who stand in their place. And if anyone presume to do
    otherwise, it must be considered null and void; nor will such a thing ever
    be counted among the sacraments of the Church." Therefore it is essential to
    this sacrament, which is called "the sacrament of the imposition of the
    hand," that it be given by a bishop.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In every work the final completion is reserved
    to the supreme act or power; thus the preparation of the matter belongs to
    the lower craftsmen, the higher gives the form, but the highest of all is he
    to whom pertains the use, which is the end of things made by art; thus also
    the letter which is written by the clerk, is signed by his employer. Now the
    faithful of Christ are a Divine work, according to 1 Cor. 3:9: "You are
    God's building"; and they are also "an epistle," as it were, "written with
    the Spirit of God," according to 2 Cor. 3:2,3. And this sacrament of
    Confirmation is, as it were, the final completion of the sacrament of
    Baptism; in the sense that by Baptism man is built up into a spiritual
    dwelling, and is written like a spiritual letter; whereas by the sacrament
    of Confirmation, like a house already built, he is consecrated as a temple
    of the Holy Ghost, and as a letter already written, is signed with the sign
    of the cross. Therefore the conferring of this sacrament is reserved to
    bishops, who possess supreme power in the Church: just as in the primitive
    Church, the fulness of the Holy Ghost was given by the apostles, in whose
    place the bishops stand (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+8"
      >Acts 8</a
    >). Hence Pope Urban I says: "All the faithful should. after Baptism,
    receive the Holy Ghost by the imposition of the bishop's hand, that they may
    become perfect Christians."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Pope has the plenitude of power in
    the Church, in virtue of which he can commit to certain lower orders things
    that belong to the higher orders: thus he allows priests to confer minor
    orders, which belong to the episcopal power. And in virtue of this fulness
    of power the Pope, Blessed Gregory, allowed simple priests to confer this
    sacrament, so long as the scandal was ended.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The sacrament of Baptism is more
    efficacious than this sacrament as to the removal of evil, since it is a
    spiritual birth, that consists in change from non-being to being. But this
    sacrament is more efficacious for progress in good; since it is a spiritual
    growth from imperfect being to perfect being. And hence this sacrament is
    committed to a more worthy minister.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Rabanus says (De Instit. Cleric. i),
    "the baptized is signed by the priest with chrism on the top of the head,
    but by the bishop on the forehead; that the former unction may symbolize the
    descent of the Holy Ghost on hint, in order to consecrate a dwelling to God:
    and that the second also may teach us that the sevenfold grace of the same
    Holy Ghost descends on man with all fulness of sanctity, knowledge and
    virtue." Hence this unction is reserved to bishops, not on account of its
    being applied to a more worthy part of the body, but by reason of its having
    a more powerful effect.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the rite of this sacrament is appropriate?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the rite of this sacrament is not
    appropriate. For the sacrament of Baptism is of greater necessity than this,
    as stated above (<a href="TP072.html#TPQ72A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 4;
    <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4). But certain seasons
    are fixed for Baptism, viz. Easter and Pentecost. Therefore some fixed time
    of the year should be chosen for this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as this sacrament requires devotion
    both in the giver and in the receiver, so also does the sacrament of
    Baptism. But in the sacrament of Baptism it is not necessary that it should
    be received or given fasting. Therefore it seems unfitting for the Council
    of Orleans to declare that "those who come to Confirmation should be
    fasting"; and the Council of Meaux, "that bishops should not give the Holy
    Ghost with imposition of the hand except they be fasting."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, chrism is a sign of the fulness of the
    Holy Ghost, as stated above (<a href="TP072.html#TPQ72A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). But the fulness of the Holy Ghost was given to Christ's faithful on the
    day of Pentecost, as related in Acts 2:1. Therefore the chrism should be
    mixed and blessed on the day of Pentecost rather than on Maundy Thursday.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Is the use of the Church, who is governed by
    the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Our Lord promised His faithful (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++18%3A20"
      >Mt. 18:20</a
    >) saying: "Where there are two or three gathered together in My name, there
    am I in the midst of them." And therefore we must hold firmly that the
    Church's ordinations are directed by the wisdom of Christ. And for this
    reason we must look upon it as certain that the rite observed by the Church,
    in this and the other sacraments, is appropriate.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Pope Melchiades says (Ep. ad Epis.
    Hispan.), "these two sacraments," viz. Baptism and Confirmation, "are so
    closely connected that they can nowise be separated save by death
    intervening, nor can one be duly celebrated without the other." Consequently
    the same seasons are fixed for the solemn celebration of Baptism and of this
    sacrament. But since this sacrament is given only by bishops, who are not
    always present where priests are baptizing, it was necessary, as regards the
    common use, to defer the sacrament of Confirmation to other seasons also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The sick and those in danger of death
    are exempt from this prohibition, as we read in the decree of the Council of
    Meaux. And therefore, on account of the multitude of the faithful, and on
    account of imminent dangers, it is allowed for this sacrament, which can be
    given by none but a bishop, to be given or received even by those who are
    not fasting: since one bishop, especially in a large diocese, would not
    suffice to confirm all, if he were confined to certain times. But where it
    can be done conveniently, it is more becoming that both giver and receiver
    should be fasting.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> According to the acts of the Council of
    Pope Martin, "it was lawful at all times to prepare the chrism." But since
    solemn Baptism, for which chrism has to be used, is celebrated on Easter
    Eve, it was rightly decreed, that chrism should be consecrated by the bishop
    two days beforehand, that it may be sent to the various parts of the
    diocese. Moreover, this day is sufficiently appropriate to the blessing of
    sacramental matter, since thereon was the Eucharist instituted, to which, in
    a certain way, all the other sacraments are ordained, as stated above (<a
