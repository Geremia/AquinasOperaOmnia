<H3 Align="Center">OF THE SACRAMENTS' PRINCIPAL EFFECT, WHICH IS GRACE (SIX ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider the effect of the sacraments. First of their 
principal effect, which is grace; secondly, of their secondary effect, 
which is a character. Concerning the first there are six points of 
inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the sacraments of the New Law are the cause of grace?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether sacramental grace confers anything in addition to the grace 
of the virtues and gifts?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the sacraments contain grace?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether there is any power in them for the causing of grace?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether the sacraments derive this power from Christ's Passion?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether the sacraments of the Old Law caused grace?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the sacraments are not the cause of grace. For it 
seems that the same thing is not both sign and cause: since the nature of 
sign appears to be more in keeping with an effect. But a sacrament is a 
sign of grace. Therefore it is not its cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing corporeal can act on a spiritual thing: since 
"the agent is more excellent than the patient," as Augustine says (Gen. 
ad lit. xii). But the subject of grace is the human mind, which is 
something spiritual. Therefore the sacraments cannot cause grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is proper to God should not be ascribed to a 
creature. But it is proper to God to cause grace, according to Ps. 83:12: 
"The Lord will give grace and glory." Since, therefore, the sacraments 
consist in certain words and created things, it seems that they cannot 
cause grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.) that the 
baptismal water "touches the body and cleanses the heart." But the heart 
is not cleansed save through grace. Therefore it causes grace: and for 
like reason so do the other sacraments of the  Church.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We must needs say that in some way the sacraments of the 
New Law cause grace. For it is evident that through the sacraments of the 
New Law man is incorporated with Christ: thus the Apostle says of Baptism 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++3%3A27">Gal. 3:27</a>): "As many of you as have been baptized in Christ have put on 
Christ." And man is made a member of Christ through grace alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, however, say that they are the cause of grace not by their own 
operation, but in so far as God causes grace in the soul when the 
sacraments are employed. And they give as an example a man who on 
presenting a leaden coin, receives, by the king's command, a hundred 
pounds: not as though the leaden coin, by any operation of its own, 
caused him to be given that sum of money; this being the effect of the 
mere will of the king. Hence Bernard says in a sermon on the Lord's 
Supper: "Just as a canon is invested by means of a book, an abbot by 
means of a crozier, a bishop by means of a ring, so by the various 
sacraments various kinds of grace are conferred." But if we examine the 
question properly, we shall see that according to the above mode the 
sacraments are mere signs. For the leaden coin is nothing but a sign of 
the king's command that this man should receive money. In like manner the 
book is a sign of the conferring of a canonry. Hence, according to this 
opinion the sacraments of the New Law would be mere signs of grace; 
whereas we have it on the authority of many saints that the sacraments of 
the New Law not only signify, but also cause grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must therefore say otherwise, that an efficient cause is twofold, 
principal and instrumental. The principal cause works by the power of its 
form, to which form the effect is likened; just as fire by its own heat 
makes something hot. In this way none but God can cause grace: since 
grace is nothing else than a participated likeness of the Divine Nature, 
according to 2 Pt. 1:4: "He hath given us most great and precious 
promises; that we may be [Vulg.: 'you may be made'] partakers of the 
Divine Nature." But the instrumental cause works not by the power of its 
form, but only by the motion whereby it is moved by the principal agent: 
so that the effect is not likened to the instrument but to the principal 
agent: for instance, the couch is not like the axe, but like the art 
which is in the craftsman's mind. And it is thus that the sacraments of 
the New Law cause grace: for they are instituted by God to be employed 
for the purpose of conferring grace. Hence Augustine says (Contra Faust. 
xix): "All these things," viz. pertaining to the sacraments, "are done 
and pass away, but the power," viz. of God, "which works by them, remains 
ever." Now that is, properly speaking, an instrument by which someone 
works: wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Titus+3%3A5">Titus 3:5</a>): "He saved us by the laver of 
regeneration."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The principal cause cannot properly be called a sign of its 
effect, even though the latter be hidden and the cause itself sensible 
and manifest. But an instrumental cause, if manifest, can be called a 
sign of a hidden effect, for this reason, that it is not merely a cause 
but also in a measure an effect in so  far as it is moved by the 
principal agent. And in this sense the sacraments of the New Law are both 
cause and signs. Hence, too, is it that, to use the common expression, 
"they effect what they signify." From this it is clear that they 
perfectly fulfil the conditions of a sacrament; being ordained to 
something sacred, not only as a sign, but also as a cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An instrument has a twofold action; one is instrumental, in 
respect of which it works not by its own power but by the power of the 
principal agent: the other is its proper action, which belongs to it in 
respect of its proper form: thus it belongs to an axe to cut asunder by 
reason of its sharpness, but to make a couch, in so far as it is the 
instrument of an art. But it does not accomplish the instrumental action 
save by exercising its proper action: for it is by cutting that it makes 
a couch. In like manner the corporeal sacraments by their operation, 
which they exercise on the body that they touch, accomplish through the 
Divine institution an instrumental operation on the soul; for example, 
the water of baptism, in respect of its proper power, cleanses the body, 
and thereby, inasmuch as it is the instrument of the Divine power, 
cleanses the soul: since from soul and body one thing is made. And thus 
it is that Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii) that it "touches the body 
and cleanses the heart."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers that which causes grace as 
principal agent; for this belongs to God alone, as stated above.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether sacramental grace confers anything in addition to the grace of the virtues and gifts?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sacramental grace confers nothing in addition to 
the grace of the virtues and gifts. For the grace of the virtues and 
gifts perfects the soul sufficiently, both in its essence and in its 
powers; as is clear from what was said in the FS, Question [110], Articles [3],4. But 
grace is ordained to the perfecting of the soul. Therefore sacramental 
grace cannot confer anything in addition to the grace of the virtues and 
gifts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the soul's defects are caused by sin. But all sins are 
sufficiently removed by the grace of the virtues and gifts: because there 
is no sin that is not contrary to some virtue. Since, therefore, 
sacramental grace is ordained to the removal of the soul's defects, it 
cannot confer anything in addition to the grace of the virtues and gifts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every addition or subtraction of form varies the species 
(Metaph. viii). If, therefore, sacramental grace confers anything in 
addition to the grace of the virtues and gifts, it follows that it is 
called grace equivocally: and so we are none the wiser when it is said 
that the sacraments cause grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> If sacramental grace confers nothing in addition to the 
grace of the virtues and gifts, it is useless to  confer the sacraments 
on those who have the virtues and gifts. But there is nothing useless in 
God's works. Therefore it seems that sacramental grace confers something 
in addition to the grace of the virtues and gifts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated in the FS, Question [110], Articles [3],4, grace, considered 
in itself, perfects the essence of the soul, in so far as it is a certain 
participated likeness of the Divine Nature. And just as the soul's powers 
flow from its essence, so from grace there flow certain perfections into 
the powers of the soul, which are called virtues and gifts, whereby the 
powers are perfected in reference to their actions. Now the sacraments 
are ordained unto certain special effects which are necessary in the 
Christian life: thus Baptism is ordained unto a certain spiritual 
regeneration, by which man dies to vice and becomes a member of Christ: 
which effect is something special in addition to the actions of the 
soul's powers: and the same holds true of the other sacraments. 
Consequently just as the virtues and gifts confer, in addition to grace 
commonly so called, a certain special perfection ordained to the powers' 
proper actions, so does sacramental grace confer, over and above grace 
commonly so called, and in addition to the virtues and gifts, a certain 
Divine assistance in obtaining the end of the sacrament. It is thus that 
sacramental grace confers something in addition to the grace of the 
virtues and gifts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The grace of the virtues and gifts perfects the essence and 
powers of the soul sufficiently as regards ordinary conduct: but as 
regards certain special effects which are necessary in a Christian life, 
sacramental grace is needed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Vices and sins are sufficiently removed by virtues and 
gifts, as to present and future time. in so far as they prevent man from 
sinning. But in regard to past sins, the acts of which are transitory 
whereas their guilt remains, man is provided with a special remedy in the 
sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sacramental grace is compared to grace commonly so called, 
as species to genus. Wherefore just as it is not equivocal to use the 
term "animal" in its generic sense, and as applied to a man, so neither 
is it equivocal to speak of grace commonly so called and of sacramental 
grace.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the sacraments of the New Law do not contain grace. 
For it seems that what is contained is in the container. But grace is not 
in the sacraments; neither as in a subject, because the subject of grace 
is not a body but a spirit; nor as in a vessel, for according to Phys. 
iv, "a vessel is a movable place," and an accident cannot be in a place. 
Therefore it seems that the sacraments of the New Law do not contain 
grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sacraments are instituted as means whereby men  may 
obtain grace. But since grace is an accident it cannot pass from one 
subject to another. Therefore it would be of no account if grace were in 
the sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a spiritual thing is not contained by a corporeal, even 
if it be therein; for the soul is not contained by the body; rather does 
it contain the body. Since, therefore, grace is something spiritual, it 
seems that it cannot be contained in a corporeal sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Hugh of S. Victor says (De Sacram. i) that "a 
sacrament, through its being sanctified, contains an invisible grace."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing is said to be in another in various ways; in two 
of which grace is said to be in the sacraments. First, as in its sign; 
for a sacrament is a sign of grace. Secondly, as in its cause; for, as 
stated above (<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) a sacrament of the New Law is an instrumental cause 
of grace. Wherefore grace is in a sacrament of the New Law, not as to its 
specific likeness, as an effect in its univocal cause; nor as to some 
proper and permanent form proportioned to such an effect, as effects in 
non-univocal causes, for instance, as things generated are in the sun; 
but as to a certain instrumental power transient and incomplete in its 
natural being, as will be explained later on (<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Grace is said to be in a sacrament not as in its subject; 
nor as in a vessel considered as a place, but understood as the 
instrument of some work to be done, according to Ezech. 9:1: "Everyone 
hath a destroying vessel [Douay: 'weapon'] in his hand."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although an accident does not pass from one subject to 
another, nevertheless in a fashion it does pass from its cause into its 
subject through the instrument; not so that it be in each of these in the 
same way, but in each according to its respective nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If a spiritual thing exist perfectly in something, it 
contains it and is not contained by it. But, in a sacrament, grace has a 
passing and incomplete mode of being: and consequently it is not 
unfitting to say that the sacraments contain grace.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether there be in the sacraments a power of causing grace?<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that there is not in the sacraments a power of causing 
grace. For the power of causing grace is a spiritual power. But a 
spiritual power cannot be in a body; neither as proper to it, because 
power flows from a thing's essence and consequently cannot transcend it; 
nor as derived from something else, because that which is received into 
anything follows the mode of the recipient. Therefore in the sacraments 
there is no power of causing grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever exists is reducible to some kind of being and 
some degree of good. But there is no assignable kind of being to which 
such a power can belong; as anyone may see by running. through them all. 
Nor is it reducible to some degree of good; for neither is it one of the 
goods of least account, since sacraments are necessary for salvation: nor 
is it an intermediate good, such as are the powers of the soul, which are 
natural powers; nor is it one of the greater goods, for it is neither 
grace nor a virtue of the mind. Therefore it seems that in the sacraments 
there is no power of causing grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if there be such a power in the sacraments, its presence 
there must be due to nothing less than a creative act of God. But it 
seems unbecoming that so excellent a being created by God should cease to 
exist as soon as the sacrament is complete. Therefore it seems that in 
the sacraments there is no power for causing grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the same thing cannot be in several. But several things 
concur in the completion of a sacrament, namely, words and things: while 
in one sacrament there can be but one power. Therefore it seems that 
there is no power of causing grace in the sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.): "Whence hath 
water so great power, that it touches the body and cleanses the heart?" 
And Bede says that "Our Lord conferred a power of regeneration on the 
waters by the contact of His most pure body."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Those who hold that the sacraments do not cause grace 
save by a certain coincidence, deny the sacraments any power that is 
itself productive of the sacramental effect, and hold that the Divine 
power assists the sacraments and produces their effect. But if we hold 
that a sacrament is an instrumental cause of grace, we must needs allow 
that there is in the sacraments a certain instrumental power of bringing 
about the sacramental effects. Now such power is proportionate to the 
instrument: and consequently it stands in comparison to the complete and 
perfect power of anything, as the instrument to the principal agent. For 
an instrument, as stated above (<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), does not work save as moved by the 
principal agent, which works of itself. And therefore the power of the 
principal agent exists in nature completely and perfectly: whereas the 
instrumental power has a being that passes from one thing into another, 
and is incomplete; just as motion is an imperfect act passing from agent 
to patient.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A spiritual power cannot be in a corporeal subject, after 
the manner of a permanent and complete power, as the argument proves. But 
there is nothing to hinder an instrumental spiritual power from being in 
a body; in so far as a body can be moved by a particular spiritual 
substance so as to produce a particular spiritual effect; thus in the 
very voice which is perceived by the senses there is a certain spiritual 
power,  inasmuch as it proceeds from a mental concept, of arousing the 
mind of the hearer. It is in this way that a spiritual power is in the 
sacraments, inasmuch as they are ordained by God unto the production of a 
spiritual effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as motion, through being an imperfect act, is not 
properly in a genus, but is reducible to a genus of perfect act, for 
instance, alteration to the genus of quality: so, instrumental power, 
properly speaking, is not in any genus, but is reducible to a genus and

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as an instrumental power accrues to an instrument 
through its being moved by the principal agent, so does a sacrament 
receive spiritual power from Christ's blessing and from the action of the 
minister in applying it to a sacramental use. Hence Augustine says in a 
sermon on the Epiphany (St. Maximus of Turin, Serm. xii): "Nor should you 
marvel, if we say that water, a corporeal substance, achieves the 
cleansing of the soul. It does indeed, and penetrates every secret 
hiding-place of the conscience. For subtle and clear as it is, the 
blessing of Christ makes it yet more subtle, so that it permeates into 
the very principles of life and searches the inner-most recesses of the 
heart."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Just as the one same power of the principal agent is 
instrumentally in all the instruments that are ordained unto the 
production of an effect, forasmuch as they are one as being so ordained: 
so also the one same sacramental power is in both words and things, 
forasmuch as words and things combine to form one sacrament.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the sacraments of the New Law derive their power from Christ's Passion?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the sacraments of the New Law do not derive their 
power from Christ's Passion. For the power of the sacraments is in the 
causing of grace which is the principle of spiritual life in the soul. 
But as Augustine says (Tract. xix in Joan.): "The Word, as He was in the 
beginning with God, quickens souls; as He was made flesh, quickens 
bodies." Since, therefore, Christ's Passion pertains to the Word as made 
flesh, it seems that it cannot cause the power of the sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the power of the sacraments seems to depend on faith. 
for as Augustine says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.), the Divine Word perfects 
the sacrament "not because it is spoken, but because it is believed." But 
our faith regards not only Christ's Passion, but also the other mysteries 
of His humanity, and in a yet higher measure, His Godhead. Therefore it 
seems that the power of the sacraments is not due specially to Christ's 
Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the sacraments are ordained unto man's justification, 
according to 1 Cor. 6:11: "You are washed . . . you are justified." Now 
justification is ascribed to the Resurrection,  according to Rm. 4:25: 
"(Who) rose again for our justification." Therefore it seems that the 
sacraments derive their power from Christ's Resurrection rather than from 
His Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> on Rm. 5:14: "After the similitude of the transgression 
of Adam," etc., the gloss says: "From the side of Christ asleep on the 
Cross flowed the sacraments which brought salvation to the Church." 
Consequently, it seems that the sacraments derive their power from 
Christ's Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) a sacrament in causing grace works 
after the manner of an instrument. Now an instrument is twofold. the one, 
separate, as a stick, for instance; the other, united, as a hand. 
Moreover, the separate instrument is moved by means of the united 
instrument, as a stick by the hand. Now the principal efficient cause of 
grace is God Himself, in comparison with Whom Christ's humanity is as a 
united instrument, whereas the sacrament is as a separate instrument. 
Consequently, the saving power must needs be derived by the sacraments 
from Christ's Godhead through His humanity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now sacramental grace seems to be ordained principally to two things: 
namely, to take away the defects consequent on past sins, in so far as 
they are transitory in act, but endure in guilt; and, further, to perfect 
the soul in things pertaining to Divine Worship in regard to the 
Christian Religion. But it is manifest from what has been stated above 
(<A Href="TP048.html#TPQ48OUTP1">Question [48]</a>, <A Href="TP048.html#TPQ48ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2,6; <A Href="TP049.html#TPQ49OUTP1">Question [49]</a>, <A Href="TP049.html#TPQ49ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3) that Christ delivered us from our sins 
principally through His Passion, not only by way of efficiency and merit, 
but also by way of satisfaction. Likewise by His Passion He inaugurated 
the Rites of the Christian Religion by offering "Himself---an oblation 
and a sacrifice to God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++5%3A2">Eph. 5:2</a>). Wherefore it is manifest that the 
sacraments of the Church derive their power specially from Christ's 
Passion, the virtue of which is in a manner united to us by our receiving 
the sacraments. It was in sign of this that from the side of Christ 
hanging on the Cross there flowed water and blood, the former of which 
belongs to Baptism, the latter to the Eucharist, which are the principal 
sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Word, forasmuch as He was in the beginning with God, 
quickens souls as principal agent; but His flesh, and the mysteries 
accomplished therein, are as instrumental causes in the process of giving 
life to the soul: while in giving life to the body they act not only as 
instrumental causes, but also to a certain extent as exemplars, as we 
stated above (<A Href="TP056.html#TPQ56OUTP1">Question [56]</a>, <A Href="TP056.html#TPQ56A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ dwells in us "by faith" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++3%3A17">Eph. 3:17</a>). Consequently, 
by faith Christ's power is united to us. Now the power of blotting out 
sin belongs in a special way to His Passion. And therefore men are 
delivered from sin especially by faith in His Passion, according to Rm. 
3:25: "Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation through faith in His 
Blood." Therefore the power of the sacraments which is ordained unto the 
remission of sins is derived principally from faith in Christ's Passion. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Justification is ascribed to the Resurrection by reason of 
the term "whither," which is newness of life through grace. But it is 
ascribed to the Passion by reason of the term "whence," i.e. in regard to 
the forgiveness of sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the sacraments of the Old Law caused grace?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the sacraments of the Old Law caused grace. For, as 
stated above (<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 2) the sacraments of the New Law derive their 
efficacy from faith in Christ's Passion. But there was faith in Christ's 
Passion under the Old Law, as well as under the New, since we have "the 
same spirit of faith" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++4%3A13">2 Cor. 4:13</a>). Therefore just as the sacraments of 
the New Law confer grace, so did the sacraments of the Old Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is no sanctification save by grace. But men were 
sanctified by the sacraments of the Old Law: for it is written (Lev. 
8:31): "And when he," i.e. Moses, "had sanctified them," i.e. Aaron and 
his sons, "in their vestments," etc. Therefore it seems that the 
sacraments of the Old Law conferred grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Bede says in a homily on the Circumcision: "Under the 
Law circumcision provided the same health-giving balm against the wound 
of original sin, as baptism in the time of revealed grace." But Baptism 
confers grace now. Therefore circumcision conferred grace; and in like 
manner, the other sacraments of the Law; for just as Baptism is the door 
of the sacraments of the New Law, so was circumcision the door of the 
sacraments of the Old Law: hence the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5%3A3">Gal. 5:3</a>): "I testify 
to every man circumcising himself, that he is a debtor to the whole law."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++4%3A9">Gal. 4:9</a>): "Turn you again to the weak 
and needy elements?" i.e. "to the Law," says the gloss, "which is called 
weak, because it does not justify perfectly." But grace justifies 
perfectly. Therefore the sacraments of the old Law did not confer grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[6] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It cannot be said that the sacraments of the Old Law 
conferred sanctifying grace of themselves, i.e. by their own power: since 
thus Christ's Passion would not have been necessary, according to Gal. 
2:21: "If justice be by the Law, then Christ died in vain."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[6] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But neither can it be said that they derived the power of conferring 
sanctifying grace from Christ's Passion. For as it was stated above (<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), the power of Christ's Passion is united to us by faith and the 
sacraments, but in different ways; because the link that comes from faith 
is produced by an act of the soul; whereas the link that comes from the 
sacraments, is produced by making use of exterior things. Now nothing 
hinders that which is subsequent in  point of time, from causing 
movement, even before it exists in reality, in so far as it pre-exists in 
an act of the soul: thus the end, which is subsequent in point of time, 
moves the agent in so far as it is apprehended and desired by him. On the 
other hand, what does not yet actually exist, does not cause movement if 
we consider the use of exterior things. Consequently, the efficient cause 
cannot in point of time come into existence after causing movement, as 
does the final cause. It is therefore clear that the sacraments of the 
New Law do reasonably derive the power of justification from Christ's 
Passion, which is the cause of man's righteousness; whereas the 
sacraments of the Old Law did not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[6] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless the Fathers of old were justified by faith in Christ's 
Passion, just as we are. And the sacraments of the old Law were a kind of 
protestation of that faith, inasmuch as they signified Christ's Passion 
and its effects. It is therefore manifest that the sacraments of the Old 
Law were not endowed with any power by which they conduced to the 
bestowal of justifying grace: and they merely signified faith by which 
men were justified.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Fathers of old had faith in the future Passion of 
Christ, which, inasmuch as it was apprehended by the mind, was able to 
justify them. But we have faith in the past Passion of Christ, which is 
able to justify, also by the real use of sacramental things as stated 
above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That sanctification was but a figure: for they were said to 
be sanctified forasmuch as they gave themselves up to the Divine worship 
according to the rite of the Old Law, which was wholly ordained to the 
foreshadowing of Christ's Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There have been many opinions about Circumcision. For, 
according to some, Circumcision conferred no grace, but only remitted 
sin. But this is impossible; because man is not justified from sin save 
by grace, according to Rm. 3:24: "Being justified freely by His grace."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore others said that by Circumcision grace is conferred, as to the 
privative effects of sin, but not as to its positive effects. But this 
also appears to be false, because by Circumcision, children received the 
faculty of obtaining glory, which is the ultimate positive effect of 
grace. Moreover, as regards the order of the formal cause, positive 
effects are naturally prior to privative effects, though according to the 
order of the material cause, the reverse is the case: for a form does not 
exclude privation save by informing the subject.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence others say that Circumcision conferred grace also as regards a 
certain positive effect, i.e. by making man worthy of eternal life, but 
not so as to repress concupiscence which makes man prone to sin. And so 
at one time it seemed to me. But if the matter be considered carefully, 
this too appears to be untrue; because the very least grace is sufficient 
to resist any degree of concupiscence, and to merit eternal life. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[62] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And therefore it seems better to say that Circumcision was a sign of 
justifying faith: wherefore the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++4%3A11">Rm. 4:11</a>) that Abraham 
"received the sign of Circumcision, a seal of the justice of faith." 
Consequently grace was conferred in Circumcision in so far as it was a 
sign of Christ's future Passion, as will be made clear further on (<A Href="TP070.html#TPQ70OUTP1">Question [70]</a>, <A Href="TP070.html#TPQ70A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).
