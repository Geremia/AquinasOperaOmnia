    OF THE SACRAMENTS' PRINCIPAL EFFECT, WHICH IS GRACE (SIX ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We have now to consider the effect of the sacraments. First of their
    principal effect, which is grace; secondly, of their secondary effect, which
    is a character. Concerning the first there are six points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the sacraments of the New
    Law are the cause of grace?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether sacramental grace confers
    anything in addition to the grace of the virtues and gifts?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the sacraments contain
    grace?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether there is any power in them
    for the causing of grace?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether the sacraments derive this
    power from Christ's Passion?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether the sacraments of the Old
    Law caused grace?

  <h3 align="left">Whether the sacraments are the cause of grace?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the sacraments are not the cause of
    grace. For it seems that the same thing is not both sign and cause: since
    the nature of sign appears to be more in keeping with an effect. But a
    sacrament is a sign of grace. Therefore it is not its cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing corporeal can act on a spiritual
    thing: since "the agent is more excellent than the patient," as Augustine
    says (Gen. ad lit. xii). But the subject of grace is the human mind, which
    is something spiritual. Therefore the sacraments cannot cause grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is proper to God should not be
    ascribed to a creature. But it is proper to God to cause grace, according to
    Ps. 83:12: "The Lord will give grace and glory." Since, therefore, the
    sacraments consist in certain words and created things, it seems that they
    cannot cause grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.) that
    the baptismal water "touches the body and cleanses the heart." But the heart
    is not cleansed save through grace. Therefore it causes grace: and for like
    reason so do the other sacraments of the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We must needs say that in some way the
    sacraments of the New Law cause grace. For it is evident that through the
    sacraments of the New Law man is incorporated with Christ: thus the Apostle
    says of Baptism (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A27"
      >Gal. 3:27</a
    >): "As many of you as have been baptized in Christ have put on Christ." And
    man is made a member of Christ through grace alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Some, however, say that they are the cause of grace not by their own
    operation, but in so far as God causes grace in the soul when the sacraments
    are employed. And they give as an example a man who on presenting a leaden
    coin, receives, by the king's command, a hundred pounds: not as though the
    leaden coin, by any operation of its own, caused him to be given that sum of
    money; this being the effect of the mere will of the king. Hence Bernard
    says in a sermon on the Lord's Supper: "Just as a canon is invested by means
    of a book, an abbot by means of a crozier, a bishop by means of a ring, so
    by the various sacraments various kinds of grace are conferred." But if we
    examine the question properly, we shall see that according to the above mode
    the sacraments are mere signs. For the leaden coin is nothing but a sign of
    the king's command that this man should receive money. In like manner the
    book is a sign of the conferring of a canonry. Hence, according to this
    opinion the sacraments of the New Law would be mere signs of grace; whereas
    we have it on the authority of many saints that the sacraments of the New
    Law not only signify, but also cause grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must therefore say otherwise, that an efficient cause is twofold,
    principal and instrumental. The principal cause works by the power of its
    form, to which form the effect is likened; just as fire by its own heat
    makes something hot. In this way none but God can cause grace: since grace
    is nothing else than a participated likeness of the Divine Nature, according
    to 2 Pt. 1:4: "He hath given us most great and precious promises; that we
    may be [Vulg.: 'you may be made'] partakers of the Divine Nature." But the
    instrumental cause works not by the power of its form, but only by the
    motion whereby it is moved by the principal agent: so that the effect is not
    likened to the instrument but to the principal agent: for instance, the
    couch is not like the axe, but like the art which is in the craftsman's
    mind. And it is thus that the sacraments of the New Law cause grace: for
    they are instituted by God to be employed for the purpose of conferring
    grace. Hence Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix): "All these things," viz.
    pertaining to the sacraments, "are done and pass away, but the power," viz.
    of God, "which works by them, remains ever." Now that is, properly speaking,
    an instrument by which someone works: wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Titus+3%3A5"
      >Titus 3:5</a
    >): "He saved us by the laver of regeneration."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The principal cause cannot properly be
    called a sign of its effect, even though the latter be hidden and the cause
    itself sensible and manifest. But an instrumental cause, if manifest, can be
    called a sign of a hidden effect, for this reason, that it is not merely a
    cause but also in a measure an effect in so far as it is moved by the
    principal agent. And in this sense the sacraments of the New Law are both
    cause and signs. Hence, too, is it that, to use the common expression, "they
    effect what they signify." From this it is clear that they perfectly fulfil
    the conditions of a sacrament; being ordained to something sacred, not only
    as a sign, but also as a cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An instrument has a twofold action; one
    is instrumental, in respect of which it works not by its own power but by
    the power of the principal agent: the other is its proper action, which
    belongs to it in respect of its proper form: thus it belongs to an axe to
    cut asunder by reason of its sharpness, but to make a couch, in so far as it
    is the instrument of an art. But it does not accomplish the instrumental
    action save by exercising its proper action: for it is by cutting that it
    makes a couch. In like manner the corporeal sacraments by their operation,
    which they exercise on the body that they touch, accomplish through the
    Divine institution an instrumental operation on the soul; for example, the
    water of baptism, in respect of its proper power, cleanses the body, and
    thereby, inasmuch as it is the instrument of the Divine power, cleanses the
    soul: since from soul and body one thing is made. And thus it is that
    Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii) that it "touches the body and cleanses the
    heart."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers that which
    causes grace as principal agent; for this belongs to God alone, as stated
    above.<br />

    Whether sacramental grace confers anything in addition to the grace of the
    virtues and gifts?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sacramental grace confers nothing
    in addition to the grace of the virtues and gifts. For the grace of the
    virtues and gifts perfects the soul sufficiently, both in its essence and in
    its powers; as is clear from what was said in the FS, Question [110],
    Articles [3],4. But grace is ordained to the perfecting of the soul.
    Therefore sacramental grace cannot confer anything in addition to the grace
    of the virtues and gifts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the soul's defects are caused by sin.
    But all sins are sufficiently removed by the grace of the virtues and gifts:
    because there is no sin that is not contrary to some virtue. Since,
    therefore, sacramental grace is ordained to the removal of the soul's
    defects, it cannot confer anything in addition to the grace of the virtues
    and gifts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every addition or subtraction of form
    varies the species (Metaph. viii). If, therefore, sacramental grace confers
    anything in addition to the grace of the virtues and gifts, it follows that
    it is called grace equivocally: and so we are none the wiser when it is said
    that the sacraments cause grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> If sacramental grace confers nothing in
    addition to the grace of the virtues and gifts, it is useless to confer the
    sacraments on those who have the virtues and gifts. But there is nothing
    useless in God's works. Therefore it seems that sacramental grace confers
    something in addition to the grace of the virtues and gifts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated in the FS, Question [110], Articles
    [3],4, grace, considered in itself, perfects the essence of the soul, in so
    far as it is a certain participated likeness of the Divine Nature. And just
    as the soul's powers flow from its essence, so from grace there flow certain
    perfections into the powers of the soul, which are called virtues and gifts,
    whereby the powers are perfected in reference to their actions. Now the
    sacraments are ordained unto certain special effects which are necessary in
    the Christian life: thus Baptism is ordained unto a certain spiritual
    regeneration, by which man dies to vice and becomes a member of Christ:
    which effect is something special in addition to the actions of the soul's
    powers: and the same holds true of the other sacraments. Consequently just
    as the virtues and gifts confer, in addition to grace commonly so called, a
    certain special perfection ordained to the powers' proper actions, so does
    sacramental grace confer, over and above grace commonly so called, and in
    addition to the virtues and gifts, a certain Divine assistance in obtaining
    the end of the sacrament. It is thus that sacramental grace confers
    something in addition to the grace of the virtues and gifts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The grace of the virtues and gifts
    perfects the essence and powers of the soul sufficiently as regards ordinary
    conduct: but as regards certain special effects which are necessary in a
    Christian life, sacramental grace is needed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Vices and sins are sufficiently removed
    by virtues and gifts, as to present and future time. in so far as they
    prevent man from sinning. But in regard to past sins, the acts of which are
    transitory whereas their guilt remains, man is provided with a special
    remedy in the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sacramental grace is compared to grace
    commonly so called, as species to genus. Wherefore just as it is not
    equivocal to use the term "animal" in its generic sense, and as applied to a
    man, so neither is it equivocal to speak of grace commonly so called and of
    sacramental grace.<br />

    Whether the sacraments of the New Law contain grace?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the sacraments of the New Law do
    not contain grace. For it seems that what is contained is in the container.
    But grace is not in the sacraments; neither as in a subject, because the
    subject of grace is not a body but a spirit; nor as in a vessel, for
    according to Phys. iv, "a vessel is a movable place," and an accident cannot
    be in a place. Therefore it seems that the sacraments of the New Law do not
    contain grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sacraments are instituted as means
    whereby men may obtain grace. But since grace is an accident it cannot pass
    from one subject to another. Therefore it would be of no account if grace
    were in the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a spiritual thing is not contained by a
    corporeal, even if it be therein; for the soul is not contained by the body;
    rather does it contain the body. Since, therefore, grace is something
    spiritual, it seems that it cannot be contained in a corporeal sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Hugh of S. Victor says (De Sacram. i) that "a
    sacrament, through its being sanctified, contains an invisible grace."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing is said to be in another in various
    ways; in two of which grace is said to be in the sacraments. First, as in
    its sign; for a sacrament is a sign of grace. Secondly, as in its cause;
    for, as stated above (<a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) a
    sacrament of the New Law is an instrumental cause of grace. Wherefore grace
    is in a sacrament of the New Law, not as to its specific likeness, as an
    effect in its univocal cause; nor as to some proper and permanent form
    proportioned to such an effect, as effects in non-univocal causes, for
    instance, as things generated are in the sun; but as to a certain
    instrumental power transient and incomplete in its natural being, as will be
    explained later on (<a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A4THEP1">Article [4]</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Grace is said to be in a sacrament not
    as in its subject; nor as in a vessel considered as a place, but understood
    as the instrument of some work to be done, according to Ezech. 9:1:
    "Everyone hath a destroying vessel [Douay: 'weapon'] in his hand."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although an accident does not pass from
    one subject to another, nevertheless in a fashion it does pass from its
    cause into its subject through the instrument; not so that it be in each of
    these in the same way, but in each according to its respective nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If a spiritual thing exist perfectly in
    something, it contains it and is not contained by it. But, in a sacrament,
    grace has a passing and incomplete mode of being: and consequently it is not
    unfitting to say that the sacraments contain grace.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether there be in the sacraments a power of causing grace?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that there is not in the sacraments a
    power of causing grace. For the power of causing grace is a spiritual power.
    But a spiritual power cannot be in a body; neither as proper to it, because
    power flows from a thing's essence and consequently cannot transcend it; nor
    as derived from something else, because that which is received into anything
    follows the mode of the recipient. Therefore in the sacraments there is no
    power of causing grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever exists is reducible to some
    kind of being and some degree of good. But there is no assignable kind of
    being to which such a power can belong; as anyone may see by running.
    through them all. Nor is it reducible to some degree of good; for neither is
    it one of the goods of least account, since sacraments are necessary for
    salvation: nor is it an intermediate good, such as are the powers of the
    soul, which are natural powers; nor is it one of the greater goods, for it
    is neither grace nor a virtue of the mind. Therefore it seems that in the
    sacraments there is no power of causing grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if there be such a power in the
    sacraments, its presence there must be due to nothing less than a creative
    act of God. But it seems unbecoming that so excellent a being created by God
    should cease to exist as soon as the sacrament is complete. Therefore it
    seems that in the sacraments there is no power for causing grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the same thing cannot be in several. But
    several things concur in the completion of a sacrament, namely, words and
    things: while in one sacrament there can be but one power. Therefore it
    seems that there is no power of causing grace in the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.):
    "Whence hath water so great power, that it touches the body and cleanses the
    heart?" And Bede says that "Our Lord conferred a power of regeneration on
    the waters by the contact of His most pure body."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Those who hold that the sacraments do not cause
    grace save by a certain coincidence, deny the sacraments any power that is
    itself productive of the sacramental effect, and hold that the Divine power
    assists the sacraments and produces their effect. But if we hold that a
    sacrament is an instrumental cause of grace, we must needs allow that there
    is in the sacraments a certain instrumental power of bringing about the
    sacramental effects. Now such power is proportionate to the instrument: and
    consequently it stands in comparison to the complete and perfect power of
    anything, as the instrument to the principal agent. For an instrument, as
    stated above (<a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), does not
    work save as moved by the principal agent, which works of itself. And
    therefore the power of the principal agent exists in nature completely and
    perfectly: whereas the instrumental power has a being that passes from one
    thing into another, and is incomplete; just as motion is an imperfect act
    passing from agent to patient.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A spiritual power cannot be in a
    corporeal subject, after the manner of a permanent and complete power, as
    the argument proves. But there is nothing to hinder an instrumental
    spiritual power from being in a body; in so far as a body can be moved by a
    particular spiritual substance so as to produce a particular spiritual
    effect; thus in the very voice which is perceived by the senses there is a
    certain spiritual power, inasmuch as it proceeds from a mental concept, of
    arousing the mind of the hearer. It is in this way that a spiritual power is
    in the sacraments, inasmuch as they are ordained by God unto the production
    of a spiritual effect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as motion, through being an
    imperfect act, is not properly in a genus, but is reducible to a genus of
    perfect act, for instance, alteration to the genus of quality: so,
    instrumental power, properly speaking, is not in any genus, but is reducible
    to a genus and species of perfect act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as an instrumental power accrues to
    an instrument through its being moved by the principal agent, so does a
    sacrament receive spiritual power from Christ's blessing and from the action
    of the minister in applying it to a sacramental use. Hence Augustine says in
    a sermon on the Epiphany (St. Maximus of Turin, Serm. xii): "Nor should you
    marvel, if we say that water, a corporeal substance, achieves the cleansing
    of the soul. It does indeed, and penetrates every secret hiding-place of the
    conscience. For subtle and clear as it is, the blessing of Christ makes it
    yet more subtle, so that it permeates into the very principles of life and
    searches the inner-most recesses of the heart."<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Just as the one same power of the
    principal agent is instrumentally in all the instruments that are ordained
    unto the production of an effect, forasmuch as they are one as being so
    ordained: so also the one same sacramental power is in both words and
    things, forasmuch as words and things combine to form one sacrament.<br />

    Whether the sacraments of the New Law derive their power from Christ's
    Passion?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the sacraments of the New Law do
    not derive their power from Christ's Passion. For the power of the
    sacraments is in the causing of grace which is the principle of spiritual
    life in the soul. But as Augustine says (Tract. xix in Joan.): "The Word, as
    He was in the beginning with God, quickens souls; as He was made flesh,
    quickens bodies." Since, therefore, Christ's Passion pertains to the Word as
    made flesh, it seems that it cannot cause the power of the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the power of the sacraments seems to
    depend on faith. for as Augustine says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.), the Divine
    Word perfects the sacrament "not because it is spoken, but because it is
    believed." But our faith regards not only Christ's Passion, but also the
    other mysteries of His humanity, and in a yet higher measure, His Godhead.
    Therefore it seems that the power of the sacraments is not due specially to
    Christ's Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the sacraments are ordained unto man's
    justification, according to 1 Cor. 6:11: "You are washed... you are
    justified." Now justification is ascribed to the Resurrection, according to
    Rm. 4:25: "(Who) rose again for our justification." Therefore it seems that
    the sacraments derive their power from Christ's Resurrection rather than
    from His Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> on Rm. 5:14: "After the similitude of the
    transgression of Adam," etc., the gloss says: "From the side of Christ
    asleep on the Cross flowed the sacraments which brought salvation to the
    Church." Consequently, it seems that the sacraments derive their power from
    Christ's Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >) a sacrament in causing grace works after the manner of an instrument. Now
    an instrument is twofold. the one, separate, as a stick, for instance; the
    other, united, as a hand. Moreover, the separate instrument is moved by
    means of the united instrument, as a stick by the hand. Now the principal
    efficient cause of grace is God Himself, in comparison with Whom Christ's
    humanity is as a united instrument, whereas the sacrament is as a separate
    instrument. Consequently, the saving power must needs be derived by the
    sacraments from Christ's Godhead through His humanity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now sacramental grace seems to be ordained principally to two things:
    namely, to take away the defects consequent on past sins, in so far as they
    are transitory in act, but endure in guilt; and, further, to perfect the
    soul in things pertaining to Divine Worship in regard to the Christian
    Religion. But it is manifest from what has been stated above (<a
      href="TP048.html#TPQ48OUTP1"
      >Question [48]</a
    >, <a href="TP048.html#TPQ48ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2,6;
    <a href="TP049.html#TPQ49OUTP1">Question [49]</a>,
    <a href="TP049.html#TPQ49ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3) that Christ delivered
    us from our sins principally through His Passion, not only by way of
    efficiency and merit, but also by way of satisfaction. Likewise by His
    Passion He inaugurated the Rites of the Christian Religion by offering
    "Himself---an oblation and a sacrifice to God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A2"
      >Eph. 5:2</a
    >). Wherefore it is manifest that the sacraments of the Church derive their
    power specially from Christ's Passion, the virtue of which is in a manner
    united to us by our receiving the sacraments. It was in sign of this that
    from the side of Christ hanging on the Cross there flowed water and blood,
    the former of which belongs to Baptism, the latter to the Eucharist, which
    are the principal sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Word, forasmuch as He was in the
    beginning with God, quickens souls as principal agent; but His flesh, and
    the mysteries accomplished therein, are as instrumental causes in the
    process of giving life to the soul: while in giving life to the body they
    act not only as instrumental causes, but also to a certain extent as
    exemplars, as we stated above (<a href="TP056.html#TPQ56OUTP1"
      >Question [56]</a
    >, <a href="TP056.html#TPQ56A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ dwells in us "by faith" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++3%3A17"
      >Eph. 3:17</a
    >). Consequently, by faith Christ's power is united to us. Now the power of
    blotting out sin belongs in a special way to His Passion. And therefore men
    are delivered from sin especially by faith in His Passion, according to Rm.
    3:25: "Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation through faith in His
    Blood." Therefore the power of the sacraments which is ordained unto the
    remission of sins is derived principally from faith in Christ's Passion.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Justification is ascribed to the
    Resurrection by reason of the term "whither," which is newness of life
    through grace. But it is ascribed to the Passion by reason of the term
    "whence," i.e. in regard to the forgiveness of sin.<br />

    Whether the sacraments of the Old Law caused grace?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the sacraments of the Old Law
    caused grace. For, as stated above (<a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >, ad 2) the sacraments of the New Law derive their efficacy from faith in
    Christ's Passion. But there was faith in Christ's Passion under the Old Law,
    as well as under the New, since we have "the same spirit of faith" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++4%3A13"
      >2 Cor. 4:13</a
    >). Therefore just as the sacraments of the New Law confer grace, so did the
    sacraments of the Old Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is no sanctification save by
    grace. But men were sanctified by the sacraments of the Old Law: for it is
    written (Lev. 8:31): "And when he," i.e. Moses, "had sanctified them," i.e.
    Aaron and his sons, "in their vestments," etc. Therefore it seems that the
    sacraments of the Old Law conferred grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Bede says in a homily on the
    Circumcision: "Under the Law circumcision provided the same health-giving
    balm against the wound of original sin, as baptism in the time of revealed
    grace." But Baptism confers grace now. Therefore circumcision conferred
    grace; and in like manner, the other sacraments of the Law; for just as
    Baptism is the door of the sacraments of the New Law, so was circumcision
    the door of the sacraments of the Old Law: hence the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A3"
      >Gal. 5:3</a
    >): "I testify to every man circumcising himself, that he is a debtor to the
    whole law."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++4%3A9"
      >Gal. 4:9</a
    >): "Turn you again to the weak and needy elements?" i.e. "to the Law," says
    the gloss, "which is called weak, because it does not justify perfectly."
    But grace justifies perfectly. Therefore the sacraments of the old Law did
    not confer grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It cannot be said that the sacraments of the
    Old Law conferred sanctifying grace of themselves, i.e. by their own power:
    since thus Christ's Passion would not have been necessary, according to Gal.
    2:21: "If justice be by the Law, then Christ died in vain."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But neither can it be said that they derived the power of conferring
    sanctifying grace from Christ's Passion. For as it was stated above (<a
      href="TP062.html#TPQ62A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >), the power of Christ's Passion is united to us by faith and the
    sacraments, but in different ways; because the link that comes from faith is
    produced by an act of the soul; whereas the link that comes from the
    sacraments, is produced by making use of exterior things. Now nothing
    hinders that which is subsequent in point of time, from causing movement,
    even before it exists in reality, in so far as it pre-exists in an act of
    the soul: thus the end, which is subsequent in point of time, moves the
    agent in so far as it is apprehended and desired by him. On the other hand,
    what does not yet actually exist, does not cause movement if we consider the
    use of exterior things. Consequently, the efficient cause cannot in point of
    time come into existence after causing movement, as does the final cause. It
    is therefore clear that the sacraments of the New Law do reasonably derive
    the power of justification from Christ's Passion, which is the cause of
    man's righteousness; whereas the sacraments of the Old Law did not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless the Fathers of old were justified by faith in Christ's Passion,
    just as we are. And the sacraments of the old Law were a kind of
    protestation of that faith, inasmuch as they signified Christ's Passion and
    its effects. It is therefore manifest that the sacraments of the Old Law
    were not endowed with any power by which they conduced to the bestowal of
    justifying grace: and they merely signified faith by which men were
    justified.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Fathers of old had faith in the
    future Passion of Christ, which, inasmuch as it was apprehended by the mind,
    was able to justify them. But we have faith in the past Passion of Christ,
    which is able to justify, also by the real use of sacramental things as
    stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That sanctification was but a figure:
    for they were said to be sanctified forasmuch as they gave themselves up to
    the Divine worship according to the rite of the Old Law, which was wholly
    ordained to the foreshadowing of Christ's Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There have been many opinions about
    Circumcision. For, according to some, Circumcision conferred no grace, but
    only remitted sin. But this is impossible; because man is not justified from
    sin save by grace, according to Rm. 3:24: "Being justified freely by His
    grace."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Wherefore others said that by Circumcision grace is conferred, as to the
    privative effects of sin, but not as to its positive effects. But this also
    appears to be false, because by Circumcision, children received the faculty
    of obtaining glory, which is the ultimate positive effect of grace.
    Moreover, as regards the order of the formal cause, positive effects are
    naturally prior to privative effects, though according to the order of the
    material cause, the reverse is the case: for a form does not exclude
    privation save by informing the subject.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence others say that Circumcision conferred grace also as regards a certain
    positive effect, i.e. by making man worthy of eternal life, but not so as to
    repress concupiscence which makes man prone to sin. And so at one time it
    seemed to me. But if the matter be considered carefully, this too appears to
    be untrue; because the very least grace is sufficient to resist any degree
    of concupiscence, and to merit eternal life.
  </p>
  <p>
    And therefore it seems better to say that Circumcision was a sign of
    justifying faith: wherefore the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++4%3A11"
      >Rm. 4:11</a
    >) that Abraham "received the sign of Circumcision, a seal of the justice of
    faith." Consequently grace was conferred in Circumcision in so far as it was
    a sign of Christ's future Passion, as will be made clear further on (<a
