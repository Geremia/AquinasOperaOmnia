    OF THE DEFECTS OF BODY ASSUMED BY THE SON OF GOD (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the defects Christ assumed in the human nature; and
    first, of the defects of body; secondly, of the defects of soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP014.html#TPQ14A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the Son of God should have
    assumed in human nature defects of body?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP014.html#TPQ14A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether He assumed the obligation
    of being subject to these defects?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP014.html#TPQ14A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether He contracted these
    defects?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP014.html#TPQ14A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether He assumed all these
    defects?

    Whether the Son of God in human nature ought to have assumed defects of
    body?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Son of God ought not to
    have assumed human nature with defects of body. For as His soul is
    personally united to the Word of God, so also is His body. But the soul of
    Christ had every perfection, both of grace and truth, as was said above (<a
      href="TP007.html#TPQ7OUTP1"
      >Question [7]</a
    >, <a href="TP007.html#TPQ7A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>;
    <a href="TP009.html#TPQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, seqq.). Hence, His body
    also ought to have been in every way perfect, not having any imperfection in
    it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the soul of Christ saw the Word of God
    by the vision wherein the blessed see, as was said above (<a
      href="TP009.html#TPQ9OUTP1"
      >Question [9]</a
    >, <a href="TP009.html#TPQ9A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), and thus the soul of
    Christ was blessed. Now by the beatification of the soul the body is
    glorified; since, as Augustine says (Ep. ad Dios. cxviii), "God made the
    soul of a nature so strong that from the fulness of its blessedness there
    pours over even into the lower nature" (i.e. the body), "not indeed the
    bliss proper to the beatific fruition and vision, but the fulness of health"
    (i.e. the vigor of incorruptibility). Therefore the body of Christ was
    incorruptible and without any defect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, penalty is the consequence of fault. But
    there was no fault in Christ, according to 1 Pt. 2:22: "Who did no guile."
    Therefore defects of body, which are penalties, ought not to have been in
    Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, no reasonable man assumes what keeps him
    from his proper end. But by such like bodily defects, the end of the
    Incarnation seems to be hindered in many ways. First, because by these
    infirmities men were kept back from knowing Him, according to Is. 53:2,3:
    "[There was no sightliness] that we should be desirous of Him. Despised and
    the most abject of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with infirmity, and
    His look was, as it were, hidden and despised, whereupon we esteemed Him
    not." Secondly, because the de. sire of the Fathers would not seem to be
    fulfilled, in whose person it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++51%3A9"
      >Is. 51:9</a
    >): "Arise, arise, put on Thy strength, O Thou Arm of the Lord." Thirdly,
    because it would seem more fitting for the devil's power to be overcome and
    man's weakness healed, by strength than by weakness. Therefore it does not
    seem to have been fitting that the Son of God assumed human nature with
    infirmities or defects of body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++2%3A18"
      >Heb. 2:18</a
    >): "For in that, wherein He Himself hath suffered and been tempted, He is
    able to succor them also that are tempted." Now He came to succor us. hence
    David said of Him (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++120%3A1"
      >Ps. 120:1</a
    >): "I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains, from whence help shall come
    to me." Therefore it was fitting for the Son of God to assume flesh subject
    to human infirmities, in order to suffer and be tempted in it and so bring
    succor to us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was fitting for the body assumed by the Son
    of God to be subject to human infirmities and defects; and especially for
    three reasons. First, because it was in order to satisfy for the sin of the
    human race that the Son of God, having taken flesh, came into the world. Now
    one satisfies for another's sin by taking on himself the punishment due to
    the sin of the other. But these bodily defects, to wit, death, hunger,
    thirst, and the like, are the punishment of sin, which was brought into the
    world by Adam, according to Rm. 5:12: "By one man sin entered into this
    world, and by sin death." Hence it was useful for the end of the Incarnation
    that He should assume these penalties in our flesh and in our stead,
    according to Is. 53:4, "Surely He hath borne our infirmities." Secondly, in
    order to cause belief in the Incarnation. For since human nature is known to
    men only as it is subject to these defects, if the Son of God had assumed
    human nature without these defects, He would not have seemed to be true man,
    nor to have true, but imaginary, flesh, as the Manicheans held. And so, as
    is said, Phil. 2:7: "He... emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant,
    being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man." Hence,
    Thomas, by the sight of His wounds, was recalled to the faith, as related
    Jn. 20:26. Thirdly, in order to show us an example of patience by valiantly
    bearing up against human passibility and defects. Hence it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++12%3A3"
      >Heb. 12:3</a
    >) that He "endured such opposition from sinners against Himself, that you
    be not wearied. fainting in your minds."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The penalties one suffers for another's
    sin are the matter, as it were, of the satisfaction for that sin; but the
    principle is the habit of soul, whereby one is inclined to wish to satisfy
    for another, and from which the satisfaction has its efficacy, for
    satisfaction would not be efficacious unless it proceeded from charity, as
    will be explained (<a href="../XP.html">XP</a>,
    <a href="../XP/XP014.html#XPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>,
    <a href="../XP/XP014.html#XPQ14A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Hence, it behooved
    the soul of Christ to be perfect as regards the habit of knowledge and
    virtue, in order to have the power of satisfying; but His body was subject
    to infirmities, that the matter of satisfaction should not be wanting.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> From the natural relationship which is
    between the soul and the body, glory flows into the body from the soul's
    glory. Yet this natural relationship in Christ was subject to the will of
    His Godhead, and thereby it came to pass that the beatitude remained in the
    soul, and did not flow into the body; but the flesh suffered what belongs to
    a passible nature; thus Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 15) that, "it was
    by the consent of the Divine will that the flesh was allowed to suffer and
    do what belonged to it."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Punishment always follows sin actual or
    original, sometimes of the one punished, sometimes of the one for whom he
    who suffers the punishment satisfies. And so it was with Christ, according
    to Is. 53:5: "He was wounded for our iniquities, He was bruised for our
    sins."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The infirmity assumed by Christ did not
    impede, but greatly furthered the end of the Incarnation, as above stated.
    And although these infirmities concealed His Godhead, they made known His
    Manhood, which is the way of coming to the Godhead, according to Rm. 5:1,2:
    "By Jesus Christ we have access to God." Moreover, the ancient Fathers did
    not desire bodily strength in Christ, but spiritual strength, wherewith He
    vanquished the devil and healed human weakness.<br />

    Whether Christ was of necessity subject to these defects?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ was not of necessity
    subject to these defects. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++53%3A7"
      >Is. 53:7</a
    >): "He was offered because it was His own will"; and the prophet is
    speaking of the offering of the Passion. But will is opposed to necessity.
    Therefore Christ was not of necessity subject to bodily defects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 20):
    "Nothing obligatory is seen in Christ: all is voluntary." Now what is
    voluntary is not necessary. Therefore these defects were not of necessity in
    Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, necessity is induced by something more
    powerful. But no creature is more powerful than the soul of Christ, to which
    it pertained to preserve its own body. Therefore these defects were not of
    necessity in Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A3"
      >Rm. 8:3</a
    >) that "God" sent "His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh." Now it is
    a condition of sinful flesh to be under the necessity of dying, and
    suffering other like passions. Therefore the necessity of suffering these
    defects was in Christ's flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Necessity is twofold. one is a necessity of
    "constraint," brought about by an external agent; and this necessity is
    contrary to both nature and will, since these flow from an internal
    principle. The other is "natural" necessity, resulting from the natural
    principles---either the form (as it is necessary for fire to heat), or the
    matter (as it is necessary for a body composed of contraries to be
    dissolved). Hence, with this necessity, which results from the matter,
    Christ's body was subject to the necessity of death and other like defects,
    since, as was said (<a href="TP014.html#TPQ14A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad
    2), "it was by the consent of the Divine will that the flesh was allowed to
    do and suffer what belonged to it." And this necessity results from the
    principles of human nature, as was said above in this article. But if we
    speak of necessity of constraint, as repugnant to the bodily nature, thus
    again was Christ's body in its own natural condition subject to necessity in
    regard to the nail that pierced and the scourge that struck. Yet inasmuch as
    such necessity is repugnant to the will, it is clear that in Christ these
    defects were not of necessity as regards either the Divine will, or the
    human will of Christ considered absolutely, as following the deliberation of
    reason; but only as regards the natural movement of the will, inasmuch as it
    naturally shrinks from death and bodily hurt.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ is said to be "offered because it
    was His own will," i.e. Divine will and deliberate human will; although
    death was contrary to the natural movement of His human will, as Damascene
    says (De Fide Orth. iii, 23,24).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This is plain from what has been said.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Nothing was more powerful than Christ's
    soul, absolutely; yet there was nothing to hinder a thing being more
    powerful in regard to this or that effect, as a nail for piercing. And this
    I say, in so far as Christ's soul is considered in its own proper nature and
    power.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether Christ contracted these defects?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ contracted bodily
    defects. For we are said to contract what we derive with our nature from
    birth. But Christ, together with human nature, derived His bodily defects
    and infirmities through His birth from His mother, whose flesh was subject
    to these defects. Therefore it seems that He contracted these defects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what is caused by the principles of
    nature is derived together with nature, and hence is contracted. Now these
    penalties are caused by the principles of human nature. Therefore Christ
    contracted them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ is likened to other men in these
    defects, as is written Heb. 2:17. But other men contract these defects.
    Therefore it seems that Christ contracted these defects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> These defects are contracted through sin,
    according to Rm. 5:12: "By one man sin entered into this world and by sin,
    death." Now sin had no place in Christ. Therefore Christ did not contract
    these defects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the verb "to contract" is understood the
    relation of effect to cause, i.e. that is said to be contracted which is
    derived of necessity together with its cause. Now the cause of death and
    such like defects in human nature is sin, since "by sin death entered into
    this world," according to Rm. 5:12. And hence they who incur these defects,
    as due to sin, are properly said to contract them. Now Christ had not these
    defects, as due to sin, since, as Augustine [*Alcuin in the Gloss, Ord.],
    expounding Jn. 3:31, "He that cometh from above, is above all," says:
    "Christ came from above, i.e. from the height of human nature, which it had
    before the fall of the first man." For He received human nature without sin,
    in the purity which it had in the state of innocence. In the same way He
    might have assumed human nature without defects. Thus it is clear that
    Christ did not contract these defects as if taking them upon Himself as due
    to sin, but by His own will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The flesh of the Virgin was conceived in
    original sin, [*See introductory note to Question [27]] and therefore
    contracted these defects. But from the Virgin, Christ's flesh assumed the
    nature without sin, and He might likewise have assumed the nature without
    its penalties. But He wished to bear its penalties in order to carry out the
    work of our redemption, as stated above (<a href="TP014.html#TPQ14A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Therefore He had these defects---not that He contracted them, but that
    He assumed them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The cause of death and other corporeal
    defects of human nature is twofold: the first is remote, and results from
    the material principles of the human body, inasmuch as it is made up of
    contraries. But this cause was held in check by original justice. Hence the
    proximate cause of death and other defects is sin, whereby original justice
    is withdrawn. And thus, because Christ was without sin, He is said not to
    have contracted these defects, but to have assumed them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ was made like to other men in the
    quality and not in the cause of these defects; and hence, unlike others, He
    did not contract them.

    Whether Christ ought to have assumed all the bodily defects of men?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ ought to have assumed
    all the bodily defects of men. For Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6,18):
    "What is unassumable is incurable." But Christ came to cure all our defects.
    Therefore He ought to have assumed all our defects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further it was said (<a
      href="TP014.html#TPQ14A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), that in order to satisfy for us, Christ ought to have had perfective
    habits of soul and defects of body. Now as regards the soul, He assumed the
    fulness of all grace. Therefore as regards the body, He ought to have
    assumed all defects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, amongst all bodily defects death holds
    the chief place. Now Christ assumed death. Much more, therefore, ought He to
    have assumed other defects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Contraries cannot take place simultaneously
    in the same. Now some infirmities are contrary to each other, being caused
    by contrary principles. Hence it could not be that Christ assumed all human
    infirmities.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP014.html#TPQ14ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,2), Christ assumed human defects in order to satisfy for the sin of human
    nature, and for this it was necessary for Him to have the fulness of
    knowledge and grace in His soul. Hence Christ ought to have assumed those
    defects which flow from the common sin of the whole nature, yet are not
    incompatible with the perfection of knowledge and grace. And thus it was not
    fitting for Him to assume all human defects or infirmities. For there are
    some defects that are incompatible with the perfection of knowledge and
    grace, as ignorance, a proneness towards evil, and a difficulty in
    well-doing. Some other defects do not flow from the whole of human nature in
    common on account of the sin of our first parent, but are caused in some men
    by certain particular causes, as leprosy, epilepsy, and the like; and these
    defects are sometimes brought about by the fault of the man, e.g. from
    inordinate eating; sometimes by a defect in the formative power. Now neither
    of these pertains to Christ, since His flesh was conceived of the Holy
    Ghost, Who has infinite wisdom and power, and cannot err or fail; and He
    Himself did nothing wrong in the order of His life. But there are some third
    defects, to be found amongst all men in common, by reason of the sin of our
    first parent, as death, hunger, thirst, and the like; and all these defects
    Christ assumed, which Damascene (De Fide Orth. i, 11; iii, 20) calls
    "natural and indetractible passions" ---natural, as following all human
    nature in common; indetractible, as implying no defect of knowledge or
    grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All particular defects of men are caused
    by the corruptibility and passibility of the body, some particular causes
    being added; and hence, since Christ healed the passibility and
    corruptibility of our body by assuming it, He consequently healed all other
    defects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The fulness of all grace and knowledge
    was due to Christ's soul of itself, from the fact of its being assumed by
    the Word of God; and hence Christ assumed all the fulness of knowledge and
    wisdom absolutely. But He assumed our defects economically, in order to
    satisfy for our sin, and not that they belonged to Him of Himself. Hence it
    was not necessary for Him to assume them all, but only such as sufficed to
    satisfy for the sin of the whole nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Death comes to all men from the sin of
    our first parent; but not other defects, although they are less than death.
    Hence there is no parity.<br />
