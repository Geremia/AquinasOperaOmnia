</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the power of Christ's soul; and under this head 
there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP013.html#TPQ13A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether He had omnipotence simply?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP013.html#TPQ13A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether He had omnipotence with regard to corporeal creatures?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP013.html#TPQ13A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether He had omnipotence with regard to His own body?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP013.html#TPQ13A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether He had omnipotence as regards the execution of His own will?

<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul of Christ had omnipotence. For 
Ambrose [*Gloss, Ord.] says on Lk. 1:32: "The power which the Son of God 
had naturally, the Man was about to receive in time." Now this would seem 
to regard the soul principally, since it is the chief part of man. Hence 
since the Son of God had omnipotence from all eternity, it would seem 
that the soul of Christ received omnipotence in time. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as the power of God is infinite, so is His knowledge. 
But the soul of Christ in a manner had the knowledge of all that God 
knows, as was said above (<A Href="TP010.html#TPQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a>, <A Href="TP010.html#TPQ10A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore He had all power; and 
thus He was omnipotent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the soul of Christ has all knowledge. Now knowledge is 
either practical or speculative. Therefore He has a practical knowledge 
of what He knows, i.e. He knew how to do what He knows; and thus it seems 
that He can do all things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> What is proper to God cannot belong to any creature. 
But it is proper to God to be omnipotent, according to Ex. 15:2,3: "He is 
my God and I will glorify Him," and further on, "Almighty is His name." 
Therefore the soul of Christ, as being a creature, has not omnipotence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<A Href="TP002.html#TPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="TP002.html#TPQ2A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="TP010.html#TPQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a>, <A Href="TP010.html#TPQ10A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) in the 
mystery of the Incarnation the union in person so took place that there 
still remained the distinction of natures, each nature still retaining 
what belonged to it. Now the active principle of a thing follows its 
form, which is the principle of action. But the form is either the very 
nature of the thing, as in simple things; or is the constituent of the 
nature of the thing; as in such as are composed of matter and form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is in this way that omnipotence flows, so to say, from the Divine 
Nature. For since the Divine Nature is the very uncircumscribed Being of 
God, as is plain from Dionysius (Div. Nom. v), it has an active power 
over everything that can have the nature of being; and this is to have 
omnipotence; just as every other thing has an active power over such 
things as the perfection of its nature extends to; as what is hot gives 
heat. Therefore since the soul of Christ is a part of human nature, it 
cannot possibly have omnipotence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By union with the Person, the Man receives omnipotence in 
time, which the Son of God had from eternity; the result of which union 
is that as the Man is said to be God, so is He said to be omnipotent; not 
that the omnipotence of the Man is distinct (as neither is His Godhead) 
from that of the Son of God, but because there is one Person of God and 
man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to some, knowledge and active power are not in 
the same ratio; for an active power flows from the very nature of the 
thing, inasmuch as action is considered to come forth from the agent; but 
knowledge is not always possessed by the very essence or form of the 
knower, since it may be had by assimilation of the knower to the thing 
known by the aid of received species. But this reason seems not to 
suffice, because even as we may understand by a likeness obtained from 
another, so also may we act by a form obtained from another, as water or 
iron heats, by heat borrowed from fire. Hence there would be no reason 
why the soul of Christ, as it can know all things by the similitudes of 
all things  impressed upon it by God, cannot do these things by the same 
similitudes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It has, therefore, to be further considered that what is received in the 
lower nature from the higher is possessed in an inferior manner; for heat 
is not received by water in the perfection and strength it had in fire. 
Therefore, since the soul of Christ is of an inferior nature to the 
Divine Nature, the similitudes of things are not received in the soul of 
Christ in the perfection and strength they had in the Divine Nature. And 
hence it is that the knowledge of Christ's soul is inferior to Divine 
knowledge as regards the manner of knowing, for God knows (things) more 
perfectly than the soul of Christ; and also as regards the number of 
things known, since the soul of Christ does not know all that God can do, 
and these God knows by the knowledge of simple intelligence; although it 
knows all things present, past, and future, which God knows by the 
knowledge of vision. So, too, the similitudes of things infused into 
Christ's soul do not equal the Divine power in acting, i.e. so as to do 
all that God can do, or to do in the same manner as God does, Who acts 
with an infinite might whereof the creature is not capable. Now there is 
no thing, to know which in some way an infinite power is needed, although 
a certain kind of knowledge belongs to an infinite power; yet there are 
things which can be done only by an infinite power, as creation and the 
like, as is plain from what has been said in the FP, Question [45]. Hence 
Christ's soul which, being a creature, is finite in might, can know, 
indeed, all things, but not in every way; yet it cannot do all things, 
which pertains to the nature of omnipotence; and, amongst other things, 
it is clear it cannot create itself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ's soul has practical and speculative knowledge; yet 
it is not necessary that it should have practical knowledge of those 
things of which it has speculative knowledge. Because for speculative 
knowledge a mere conformity or assimilation of the knower to the thing 
known suffices; whereas for practical knowledge it is required that the 
forms of the things in the intellect should be operative. Now to have a 
form and to impress this form upon something else is more than merely to 
have the form; as to be lightsome and to enlighten is more than merely to 
be lightsome. Hence the soul of Christ has a speculative knowledge of 
creation (for it knows the mode of God's creation), but it has no 
practical knowledge of this mode, since it has no knowledge operative of 
creation.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the soul of Christ had omnipotence with regard to the transmutation of creatures?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul of Christ had omnipotence with regard 
to the transmutation of creatures. For He Himself says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++28:18">Mt. 28:18</a>): "All 
power is given to Me in heaven and on earth." Now by the words "heaven 
and earth" are meant all creatures, as is plain from Gn. 1:1: "In the 
beginning God created heaven and earth." Therefore it seems that the soul 
of Christ had omnipotence  with regard to the transmutation of creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the soul of Christ is the most perfect of all creatures. 
But every creature can be moved by another creature; for Augustine says 
(De Trin. iii, 4) that "even as the denser and lower bodies are ruled in 
a fixed way by the subtler and stronger bodies; so are all bodies by the 
spirit of life, and the irrational spirit of life by the rational spirit 
of life, and the truant and sinful rational spirit of life by the 
rational, loyal, and righteous spirit of life." But the soul of Christ 
moves even the highest spirits, enlightening them, as Dionysius says 
(Coel. Hier. vii). Therefore it seems that the soul of Christ has 
omnipotence with regard to the transmutation of creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ's soul had in its highest degree the "grace of 
miracles" or works of might. But every transmutation of the creature can 
belong to the grace of miracles; since even the heavenly bodies were 
miraculously changed from their course, as Dionysius proves (Ep. ad 
Polycarp). Therefore Christ's soul had omnipotence with regard to the 
transmutation of creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> To transmute creatures belongs to Him Who preserves 
them. Now this belongs to God alone, according to Heb. 1:3: "Upholding 
all things by the word of His power." Therefore God alone has omnipotence 
with regard to the transmutation of creatures. Therefore this does not 
belong to Christ's soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Two distinctions are here needed. of these the first is 
with respect to the transmutation of creatures, which is three-fold. The 
first is natural, being brought about by the proper agent naturally; the 
second is miraculous, being brought about by a supernatural agent above 
the wonted order and course of nature, as to raise the dead; the third is 
inasmuch as every creature may be brought to nothing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second distinction has to do with Christ's soul, which may be looked 
at in two ways: first in its proper nature and with its power of nature 
or of grace; secondly, as it is the instrument of the Word of God, 
personally united to Him. Therefore if we speak of the soul of Christ in 
its proper nature and with its power of nature or of grace, it had power 
to cause those effects proper to a soul (e.g. to rule the body and direct 
human acts, and also, by the fulness of grace and knowledge to enlighten 
all rational creatures falling short of its perfection), in a manner 
befitting a rational creature. But if we speak of the soul of Christ as 
it is the instrument of the Word united to Him, it had an instrumental 
power to effect all the miraculous transmutations ordainable to the end 
of the Incarnation, which is "to re-establish all things that are in 
heaven and on earth" [*Eph. 1:10]. But the transmutation of creatures, 
inasmuch as they may be brought to nothing, corresponds to their 
creation, whereby they were brought from nothing. And hence even as God 
alone can create, so, too, He alone can bring creatures to nothing, and 
He alone upholds them in being, lest they fall back to nothing. And thus 
it must be said that the soul of  Christ had not omnipotence with regard 
to the transmutation of creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Jerome says (on the text quoted): "Power is given Him," 
i.e. to Christ as man, "Who a little while before was crucified, buried 
in the tomb, and afterwards rose again." But power is said to have been 
given Him, by reason of the union whereby it was brought about that a Man 
was omnipotent, as was said above (<A Href="TP013.html#TPQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1). And although this was 
made known to the angels before the Resurrection, yet after the 
Resurrection it was made known to all men, as Remigius says (cf. Catena 
Aurea). Now, "things are said to happen when they are made known" [*Hugh 
of St. Victor: Qq. in Ep. ad Philip.]. Hence after the Resurrection our 
Lord says "that all power is given" to Him "in heaven and on earth."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although every creature is transmutable by some other 
creature, except, indeed, the highest angel, and even it can be 
enlightened by Christ's soul; yet not every transmutation that can be 
made in a creature can be made by a creature; since some transmutations 
can be made by God alone. Yet all transmutations that can be made in 
creatures can be made by the soul of Christ, as the instrument of the 
Word, but not in its proper nature and power, since some of these 
transmutations pertain to the soul neither in the order of nature nor in 
the order of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As was said in the SS, Question [178], Article [1], ad 1, the grace of 
mighty works or miracles is given to the soul of a saint, so that these 
miracles are wrought not by his own, but by Divine power. Now this grace 
was bestowed on Christ's soul most excellently, i.e. not only that He 
might work miracles, but also that He might communicate this grace to 
others. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++10:1">Mt. 10:1</a>) that, "having called His twelve 
disciples together, He gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them 
out, and to heal all manner of diseases, and all manner of infirmities."<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's soul had omnipotence with regard to 
His own body. For Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 20,23) that "all 
natural things were voluntary to Christ; He willed to hunger, He willed 
to thirst, He willed to fear, He willed to die." Now God is called 
omnipotent because "He hath done all things whatsoever He would" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++113:11">Ps. 113:11</a>). Therefore it seems that Christ's soul had omnipotence with 
regard to the natural operations of the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, human nature was more perfect in Christ than in Adam, 
who had a body entirely subject to the soul, so that nothing could happen 
to the body against the will of the soul---and this on account of the 
original justice which it had in the state of innocence. Much more, 
therefore, had Christ's soul omnipotence with regard to His body. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the body is naturally changed by the imaginations of the 
soul; and so much more changed, the stronger the soul's imagination, as 
was said in the FP, Question [117], Article [3], ad 3. Now the soul of Christ had most 
perfect strength as regards both the imagination and the other powers. 
Therefore the soul of Christ was omnipotent with regard to His own body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++2:17">Heb. 2:17</a>) that "it behooved Him in all 
things to be made like unto His brethren," and especially as regards what 
belongs to the condition of human nature. But it belongs to the condition 
of human nature that the health of the body and its nourishment and 
growth are not subject to the bidding of reason or will, since natural 
things are subject to God alone Who is the author of nature. Therefore 
they were not subject in Christ. Therefore Christ's soul was not 
omnipotent with regard to His own body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP013.html#TPQ13A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), Christ's soul may be viewed in 
two ways. First, in its proper nature and power; and in this way, as it 
was incapable of making exterior bodies swerve from the course and order 
of nature, so, too, was it incapable of changing its own body from its 
natural disposition, since the soul, of its own nature, has a determinate 
relation to its body. Secondly, Christ's soul may be viewed as an 
instrument united in person to God's Word; and thus every disposition of 
His own body was wholly subject to His power. Nevertheless, since the 
power of an action is not properly attributed to the instrument, but to 
the principal agent, this omnipotence is attributed to the Word of God 
rather than to Christ's soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This saving of Damascene refers to the Divine will of 
Christ, since, as he says in the preceding chapter (De Fide Orth. xix, 
14,15), it was by the consent of the Divine will that the flesh was 
allowed to suffer and do what was proper to it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It was no part of the original justice which Adam had in 
the state of innocence that a man's soul should have the power of 
changing his own body to any form, but that it should keep it from any 
hurt. Yet Christ could have assumed even this power if He had wished. But 
since man has three states---viz. innocence, sin, and glory, even as from 
the state of glory He assumed comprehension and from the state of 
innocence, freedom from sin---so also from the state of sin did He assume 
the necessity of being under the penalties of this life, as will be said 
(<A Href="TP014.html#TPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="TP014.html#TPQ14A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If the imagination be strong, the body obeys naturally in 
some things, e.g. as regards falling from a beam set on high, since the 
imagination was formed to be a principle of local motion, as is said De 
Anima iii, 9,10. So, too, as regards alteration in heat and cold, and 
their consequences; for the passions of the soul, wherewith the heart is 
moved, naturally follow the imagination, and thus by commotion of the 
spirits the whole body is altered. But the other corporeal dispositions 
which  have no natural relation to the imagination are not transmuted by 
the imagination, however strong it is, e.g. the shape of the hand, or 
foot, or such like.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the soul of Christ had not omnipotence as

"entering into a house, He would that no man should know it, and He could 
not be hid." Therefore He could not carry out the purpose of His will in

Question [19], Article [12]. But our Lord commanded certain things to be done, and the 
contrary came to pass, for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++9:30,+31">Mt. 9:30, 31</a>) that Jesus 
strictly charged them whose eyes had been opened, saying: "See that no 
man know this. But they going out spread His fame abroad in all that 
country." Therefore He could not carry out the purpose of His will in 
everything.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a man does not ask from another for what he can do 
himself. But our Lord besought the Father, praying for what He wished to 
be done, for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++6:12">Lk. 6:12</a>): "He went out into a mountain to 
pray, and He passed the whole night in the prayer of God." Therefore He 
could not carry out the purpose of His will in all things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Qq. Nov. et Vet. Test., qu. 77): "It is 
impossible for the will of the Saviour not to be fulfilled: nor is it 
possible for Him to will what He knows ought not to come to pass."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Christ's soul willed things in two ways. First, what was 
to be brought about by Himself; and it must be said that He was capable 
of whatever He willed thus, since it would not befit His wisdom if He 
willed to do anything of Himself that was not subject to His will. 
Secondly, He wished things to be brought about by the Divine power, as 
the resurrection of His own body and such like miraculous deeds, which He 
could not effect by His own power, except as the instrument of the 
Godhead, as was said above (<A Href="TP013.html#TPQ13A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (Qq. Nov. et Vet. Test., qu. 77): "What 
came to pass, this Christ must be said to have willed. For it must be 
remarked that this happened in the country of the Gentiles, to whom it 
was not yet time to preach. Yet it would have been invidious not to 
welcome such as came spontaneously for the faith. Hence He did not wish 
to be heralded by His own, and yet He wished to be sought; and so it came 
to pass." Or it may be said that this will of Christ was not with regard 
to what was to be carried out by it, but with regard to what was to be 
done by others, which did not come under His human will. Hence in the 
letter of Pope Agatho, which was approved in the Sixth Council  [*Third 
Council of Constantinople, Act. iv], we read: "When He, the Creator and 
Redeemer of all, wished to be hid and could not, must not this be 
referred only to His human will which He deigned to assume in time?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Gregory says (Moral. xix), by the fact that "Our Lord 
charged His mighty works to be kept secret, He gave an example to His 
servants coming after Him that they should wish their miracles to be 
hidden; and yet, that others may profit by their example, they are made 
public against their will." And thus this command signified His will to 
fly from human glory, according to Jn. 8:50, "I seek not My own glory." 
Yet He wished absolutely, and especially by His Divine will, that the 
miracle wrought should be published for the good of others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[13] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ prayed both for things that were to be brought about 
by the Divine power, and for what He Himself was to do by His human will, 
since the power and operation of Christ's soul depended on God, "Who 
works in all [Vulg.: 'you'], both to will and to accomplish" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++2:13">Phil. 2:13</a>).<br>
