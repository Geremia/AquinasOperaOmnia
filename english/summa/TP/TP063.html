    Whether a sacrament imprints a character on the soul?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a sacrament does not imprint a
    character on the soul. For the word "character" seems to signify some kind
    of distinctive sign. But Christ's members are distinguished from others by
    eternal predestination, which does not imply anything in the predestined,
    but only in God predestinating, as we have stated in the FP, Question [23],
    Article [2]. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Tim++2%3A19"
      >2 Tim. 2:19</a
    >): "The sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal: The Lord
    knoweth who are His." Therefore the sacraments do not imprint a character on
    the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a character is a distinctive sign. Now a
    sign, as Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. ii) "is that which conveys
    something else to the mind, besides the species which it impresses on the
    senses." But nothing in the soul can impress a species on the senses.
    Therefore it seems that no character is imprinted on the soul by the
    sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the believer is distinguished
    from the unbeliever by the sacraments of the New Law, so was it under the
    Old Law. But the sacraments of the Old Law did not imprint a character;
    whence they are called "justices of the flesh" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++9%3A10"
      >Heb. 9:10</a
    >) by the Apostle. Therefore neither seemingly do the sacraments of the New
    Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++1%3A21,22"
      >2 Cor. 1:21,22</a
    >): "He... that hath anointed us is God; Who also hath sealed us, and given
    the pledge of the spirit in our hearts." But a character means nothing else
    than a kind of sealing. Therefore it seems that by the sacraments God
    imprints His character on us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As is clear from what has been already stated
    (<a href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>) the sacraments of the New
    Law are ordained for a twofold purpose; namely, for a remedy against sins;
    and for the perfecting of the soul in things pertaining to the Divine
    worship according to the rite of the Christian life. Now whenever anyone is
    deputed to some definite purpose he is wont to receive some outward sign
    thereof; thus in olden times soldiers who enlisted in the ranks used to be
    marked with certain characters on the body, through being deputed to a
    bodily service. Since, therefore, by the sacraments men are deputed to a
    spiritual service pertaining to the worship of God, it follows that by their
    means the faithful receive a certain spiritual character. Wherefore
    Augustine says (Contra Parmen. ii): "If a deserter from the battle, through
    dread of the mark of enlistment on his body, throws himself on the emperor's
    clemency, and having besought and received mercy, return to the fight; is
    that character renewed, when the man has been set free and reprimanded? is
    it not rather acknowledged and approved? Are the Christian sacraments, by
    any chance, of a nature less lasting than this bodily mark?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The faithful of Christ are destined to
    the reward of the glory that is to come, by the seal of Divine
    Predestination. But they are deputed to acts becoming the Church that is
    now, by a certain spiritual seal that is set on them, and is called a
    character.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The character imprinted on the soul is a
    kind of sign in so far as it is imprinted by a sensible sacrament: since we
    know that a certain one has received the baptismal character, through his
    being cleansed by the sensible water. Nevertheless from a kind of likeness,
    anything that assimilates one thing to another, or discriminates one thing
    from another, even though it be not sensible, can be called a character or a
    seal; thus the Apostle calls Christ "the figure" or {charakter} "of the
    substance of the Father" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++1%3A3"
      >Heb. 1:3</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1"
      >Question [62]</a
    >, <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>) the sacraments of the
    Old Law had not in themselves any spiritual power of producing a spiritual
    effect. Consequently in those sacraments there was no need of a spiritual
    character, and bodily circumcision sufficed, which the Apostle calls "a
    seal" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++4%3A11"
      >Rm. 4:11</a
    >).<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether a character is a spiritual power?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a character is not a spiritual
    power. For "character" seems to be the same thing as "figure"; hence (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++1%3A3"
      >Heb. 1:3</a
    >), where we read "figure of His substance, "for "figure" the Greek has
    {charakter}. Now "figure" is in the fourth species of quality, and thus
    differs from power which is in the second species. Therefore character is
    not a spiritual power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. ii): "The
    Divine Beatitude admits him that seeks happiness to a share in Itself, and
    grants this share to him by conferring on him Its light as a kind of seal."
    Consequently, it seems that a character is a kind of light. Now light
    belongs rather to the third species of quality. Therefore a character is not
    a power, since this seems to belong to the second species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, character is defined by some thus: "A
    character is a holy sign of the communion of faith and of the holy
    ordination conferred by a hierarch." Now a sign is in the genus of
    "relation," not of "power." Therefore a character is not a spiritual
    power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a power is in the nature of a cause and
    principle (Metaph. v). But a "sign" which is set down in the definition of a
    character is rather in the nature of an effect. Therefore a character is not
    a spiritual power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. ii): "There are
    three things in the soul, power, habit, and passion." Now a character is not
    a passion: since a passion passes quickly, whereas a character is indelible,
    as will be made clear further on (<a href="TP063.html#TPQ63A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >). In like manner it is not a habit: because no habit is indifferent to
    acting well or ill: whereas a character is indifferent to either, since some
    use it well, some ill. Now this cannot occur with a habit: because no one
    abuses a habit of virtue, or uses well an evil habit. It remains, therefore,
    that a character is a power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP063.html#TPQ63A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), the sacraments of the New Law produce a character, in so far as by them
    we are deputed to the worship of God according to the rite of the Christian
    religion. Wherefore Dionysius (Eccl. Hier. ii), after saying that God "by a
    kind of sign grants a share of Himself to those that approach Him," adds "by
    making them Godlike and communicators of Divine gifts." Now the worship of
    God consists either in receiving Divine gifts, or in bestowing them on
    others. And for both these purposes some power is needed; for to bestow
    something on others, active power is necessary; and in order to receive, we
    need a passive power. Consequently, a character signifies a certain
    spiritual power ordained unto things pertaining to the Divine worship.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But it must be observed that this spiritual power is instrumental: as we
    have stated above (<a href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) of the virtue which is in
    the sacraments. For to have a sacramental character belongs to God's
    ministers: and a minister is a kind of instrument, as the Philosopher says
    (Polit. i). Consequently, just as the virtue which is in the sacraments is
    not of itself in a genus, but is reducible to a genus, for the reason that
    it is of a transitory and incomplete nature: so also a character is not
    properly in a genus or species, but is reducible to the second species of
    quality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Configuration is a certain boundary of
    quantity. Wherefore, properly speaking, it is only in corporeal things; and
    of spiritual things is said metaphorically. Now that which decides the genus
    or species of a thing must needs be predicated of it properly. Consequently,
    a character cannot be in the fourth species of quality, although some have
    held this to be the case.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The third species of quality contains
    only sensible passions or sensible qualities. Now a character is not a
    sensible light. Consequently, it is not in the third species of quality as
    some have maintained.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The relation signified by the word
    "sign" must needs have some foundation. Now the relation signified by this
    sign which is a character, cannot be founded immediately on the essence of
    the soul: because then it would belong to every soul naturally.
    Consequently, there must be something in the soul on which such a relation
    is founded. And it is in this that a character essentially consists.
    Therefore it need not be in the genus "relation" as some have held.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A character is in the nature of a sign
    in comparison to the sensible sacrament by which it is imprinted. But
    considered in itself, it is in the nature of a principle, in the way already
    explained.<br />

    Whether the sacramental character is the character of Christ?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the sacramental character is not
    the character of Christ. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++4%3A30"
      >Eph. 4:30</a
    >): "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed." But a
    character consists essentially in some. thing that seals. Therefore the
    sacramental character should be attributed to the Holy Ghost rather than to
    Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a character has the nature of a sign.
    And it is a sign of the grace that is conferred by the sacrament. Now grace
    is poured forth into the soul by the whole Trinity; wherefore it is written
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++83%3A12">Ps. 83:12</a>):
    "The Lord will give grace and glory." Therefore it seems that the
    sacramental character should not be attributed specially to Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a man is marked with a character that he
    may be distinguishable from others. But the saints are distinguishable from
    others by charity, which, as Augustine says (De Trin. xv), "alone separates
    the children of the Kingdom from the children of perdition": wherefore also
    the children of perdition are said to have "the character of the beast" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++13%3A16,17"
      >Apoc. 13:16,17</a
    >). But charity is not attributed to Christ, but rather to the Holy Ghost
    according to Rm. 5:5: "The charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by
    the Holy Ghost, Who is given to us"; or even to the Father, according to 2
    Cor. 13:13: "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the charity of God."
    Therefore it seems that the sacramental character should not be attributed
    to Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Some define character thus: "A character is a
    distinctive mark printed in a man's rational soul by the eternal Character,
    whereby the created trinity is sealed with the likeness of the creating and
    re-creating Trinity, and distinguishing him from those who are not so
    enlikened, according to the state of faith." But the eternal Character is
    Christ Himself, according to Heb. 1:3: "Who being the brightness of His
    glory and the figure," or character, "of His substance." It seems,
    therefore, that the character should properly be attributed to Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As has been made clear above (<a
      href="TP063.html#TPQ63A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), a character is properly a kind of seal, whereby something is marked, as
    being ordained to some particular end: thus a coin is marked for use in
    exchange of goods, and soldiers are marked with a character as being deputed
    to military service. Now the faithful are deputed to a twofold end. First
    and principally to the enjoyment of glory. And for this purpose they are
    marked with the seal of grace according to Ezech. 9:4: "Mark Thou upon the
    foreheads of the men that sigh and mourn"; and Apoc. 7:3: "Hurt not the
    earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we sign the servants of our God in
    their foreheads."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, each of the faithful is deputed to receive, or to bestow on
    others, things pertaining to the worship of God. And this, properly
    speaking, is the purpose of the sacramental character. Now the whole rite of
    the Christian religion is derived from Christ's priesthood. Consequently, it
    is clear that the sacramental character is specially the character of
    Christ, to Whose character the faithful are likened by reason of the
    sacramental characters, which are nothing else than certain participations
    of Christ's Priesthood, flowing from Christ Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle speaks there of that sealing
    by which a man is assigned to future glory, and which is effected by grace.
    Now grace is attributed to the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as it is through love
    that God gives us something gratis, which is the very nature of grace: while
    the Holy Ghost is love. Wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++12%3A4"
      >1 Cor. 12:4</a
    >): "There are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The sacramental character is a thing as
    regards the exterior sacrament, and a sacrament in regard to the ultimate
    effect. Consequently, something can be attributed to a character in two
    ways. First, if the character be considered as a sacrament: and thus it is a
    sign of the invisible grace which is conferred in the sacrament. Secondly,
    if it be considered as a character. And thus it is a sign conferring on a
    man a likeness to some principal person in whom is vested the authority over
    that to which he is assigned: thus soldiers who are assigned to military
    service, are marked with their leader's sign, by which they are, in a
    fashion, likened to him. And in this way those who are deputed to the
    Christian worship, of which Christ is the author, receive a character by
    which they are likened to Christ. Consequently, properly speaking, this is
    Christ's character.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A character distinguishes one from
    another, in relation to some particular end, to which he, who receives the
    character is ordained: as has been stated concerning the military character
    (<a href="TP063.html#TPQ63A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) by which a soldier of
    the king is distinguished from the enemy's soldier in relation to the
    battle. In like manner the character of the faithful is that by which the
    faithful of Christ are distinguished from the servants of the devil, either
    in relation to eternal life, or in relation to the worship of the Church
    that now is. Of these the former is the result of charity and grace, as the
    objection runs; while the latter results from the sacramental character.
    Wherefore the "character of the beast" may be understood by opposition, to
    mean either the obstinate malice for which some are assigned to eternal
    punishment, or the profession of an unlawful form of worship.<br />

    Whether the character be subjected in the powers of the soul?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the character is not subjected in
    the powers of the soul. For a character is said to be a disposition to
    grace. But grace is subjected in the essence of the soul as we have stated
    in the FS, Question [110], Article [4]. Therefore it seems that the
    character is in the essence of the soul and not in the powers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a power of the soul does not seem to be
    the subject of anything save habit and disposition. But a character, as
    stated above (<a href="TP063.html#TPQ63A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), is neither
    habit nor disposition, but rather a power: the subject of which is nothing
    else than the essence of the soul. Therefore it seems that the character is
    not subjected in a power of the soul, but rather in its essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the powers of the soul are divided into
    those of knowledge and those of appetite. But it cannot be said that a
    character is only in a cognitive power, nor, again, only in an appetitive
    power: since it is neither ordained to knowledge only, nor to desire only.
    Likewise, neither can it be said to be in both, because the same accident
    cannot be in several subjects. Therefore it seems that a character is not
    subjected in a power of the soul, but rather in the essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A character, according to its definition
    given above (<a href="TP063.html#TPQ63A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), is
    imprinted in the rational soul "by way of an image." But the image of the
    Trinity in the soul is seen in the powers. Therefore a character is in the
    powers of the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP063.html#TPQ63A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), a character is a kind of seal by which the soul is marked, so that it
    may receive, or bestow on others, things pertaining to Divine worship. Now
    the Divine worship consists in certain actions: and the powers of the soul
    are properly ordained to actions, just as the essence is ordained to
    existence. Therefore a character is subjected not in the essence of the
    soul, but in its power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The subject is ascribed to an. accident
    in respect of that to which the accident disposes it proximately, but not in
    respect of that to which it disposes it remotely or indirectly. Now a
    character disposes the soul directly and proximately to the fulfilling of
    things pertaining to Divine worship: and because such cannot be accomplished
    suitably without the help of grace, since, according to Jn. 4:24, "they that
    adore" God "must adore Him in spirit and in truth," consequently, the Divine
    bounty bestows grace on those who receive the character, so that they may
    accomplish worthily the service to which they are deputed. Therefore the
    subject should be ascribed to a character in respect of those actions that
    pertain to the Divine worship, rather than in respect of grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The subject of the natural power, which
    flows from the principles of the essence. Now a character is not a power of
    this kind. but a spiritual power coming from without. Wherefore, just as the
    essence of the soul, from which man has his natural life, is perfected by
    grace from which the soul derives spiritual life; so the natural power of
    the soul is perfected by a spiritual power, which is a character. For habit
    and disposition belong to a power of the soul, since they are ordained to
    actions of which the powers are the principles. And in like manner whatever
    is ordained to action, should be attributed to a power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above, a character is ordained
    unto things pertaining to the Divine worship; which is a protestation of
    faith expressed by exterior signs. Consequently, a character needs to be in
    the soul's cognitive power, where also is faith.<br />

    Whether a character can be blotted out from the soul?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a character can be blotted out from
    the soul. Because the more perfect an accident is, the more firmly does it
    adhere to its subject. But grace is more perfect than a character; because a
    character is ordained unto grace as to a further end. Now grace is lost
    through sin. Much more, therefore, is a character so lost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by a character a man is deputed to the
    Divine worship, as stated above (<a href="TP063.html#TPQ63ATHEP1"
      >Articles [3]</a
    >,4). But some pass from the worship of God to a contrary worship by
    apostasy from the faith. It seems, therefore, that such lose the sacramental
    character.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, when the end ceases, the means to the
    end should cease also: thus after the resurrection there will be no
    marriage, because begetting will cease, which is the purpose of marriage.
    Now the exterior worship to which a character is ordained, will not endure
    in heaven, where there will be no shadows, but all will be truth without a
    veil. Therefore the sacramental character does not last in the soul for
    ever: and consequently it can be blotted out.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Parmen. ii): "The
    Christian sacraments are not less lasting than the bodily mark" of military
    service. But the character of military service is not repeated, but is
    "recognized and approved" in the man who obtains the emperor's forgiveness
    after offending him. Therefore neither can the sacramental character be
    blotted out.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP063.html#TPQ63A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), in a sacramental character Christ's faithful have a share in His
    Priesthood; in the sense that as Christ has the full power of a spiritual
    priesthood, so His faithful are likened to Him by sharing a certain
    spiritual power with regard to the sacraments and to things pertaining to
    the Divine worship. For this reason it is unbecoming that Christ should have
    a character: but His Priesthood is compared to a character, as that which is
    complete and perfect is compared to some participation of itself. Now
    Christ's Priesthood is eternal, according to Ps. 109:4: "Thou art a priest
    for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech." Consequently, every
    sanctification wrought by His Priesthood, is perpetual, enduring as long as
    the thing sanctified endures. This is clear even in inanimate things; for
    the consecration of a church or an altar lasts for ever unless they be
    destroyed. Since, therefore, the subject of a character is the soul as to
    its intellective part, where faith resides, as stated above (<a
      href="TP063.html#TPQ63A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >, ad 3); it is clear that, the intellect being perpetual and incorruptible,
    a character cannot be blotted out from the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Both grace and character are in the
    soul, but in different ways. For grace is in the soul, as a form having
    complete existence therein: whereas a character is in the soul, as an
    instrumental power, as stated above (<a href="TP063.html#TPQ63A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). Now a complete form is in its subject according to the condition of the
    subject. And since the soul as long as it is a wayfarer is changeable in
    respect of the free-will, it results that grace is in the soul in a
    changeable manner. But an instrumental power follows rather the condition of
    the principal agent: and consequently a character exists in the soul in an
    indelible manner, not from any perfection of its own, but from the
    perfection of Christ's Priesthood, from which the character flows like an
    instrumental power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (Contra Parmen. ii),
    "even apostates are not deprived of their baptism, for when they repent and
    return to the fold they do not receive it again; whence we conclude that it
    cannot be lost." The reason of this is that a character is an instrumental
    power, as stated above (ad 1), and the nature of an instrument as such is to
    be moved by another, but not to move itself; this belongs to the will.
    Consequently, however much the will be moved in the contrary direction, the
    character is not removed, by reason of the immobility of the principal
    mover.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although external worship does not last
    after this life, yet its end remains. Consequently, after this life the
    character remains, both in the good as adding to their glory, and in the
    wicked as increasing their shame: just as the character of the military
    service remains in the soldiers after the victory, as the boast of the
    conquerors, and the disgrace of the conquered.<br />

    Whether a character is imprinted by each sacrament of the New Law?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a character is imprinted by all the
    sacraments of the New Law: because each sacrament of the New Law makes man a
    participator in Christ's Priesthood. But the sacramental character is
    nothing but a participation in Christ's Priesthood, as already stated (<a
      href="TP063.html#TPQ63ATHEP1"
      >Articles [3]</a
    >,5). Therefore it seems that a character is imprinted by each sacrament of
    the New Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a character may be compared to the soul
    in which it is, as a consecration to that which is consecrated. But by each
    sacrament of the New Law man becomes the recipient of sanctifying grace, as
    stated above (<a href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore it seems that
    a character is imprinted by each sacrament of the New Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a character is both a reality and a
    sacrament. But in each sacrament of the New Law, there is something which is
    only a reality, and something which is only a sacrament, and something which
    is both reality and sacrament. Therefore a character is imprinted by each
    sacrament of the New Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Those sacraments in which a character is
    imprinted, are not reiterated, because a character is indelible, as stated
    above (<a href="TP063.html#TPQ63A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>): whereas some
    sacraments are reiterated, for instance, penance and matrimony. Therefore
    not all the sacraments imprint a character.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1"
      >Question [62]</a
    >, <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,5), the sacraments of
    the New Law are ordained for a twofold purpose, namely, as a remedy for sin,
    and for the Divine worship. Now all the sacraments, from the fact that they
    confer grace, have this in common, that they afford a remedy against sin:
    whereas not all the sacraments are directly ordained to the Divine worship.
    Thus it is clear that penance, whereby man is delivered from sin, does not
    afford man any advance in the Divine worship, but restores him to his former
    state.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now a sacrament may belong to the Divine worship in three ways: first in
    regard to the thing done; secondly, in regard to the agent; thirdly, in
    regard to the recipient. In regard to the thing done, the Eucharist belongs
    to the Divine worship, for the Divine worship consists principally therein,
    so far as it is the sacrifice of the Church. And by this same sacrament a
    character is not imprinted on man; because it does not ordain man to any
    further sacramental action or benefit received, since rather is it "the end
    and consummation of all the sacraments," as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier.
    iii). But it contains within itself Christ, in Whom there is not the
    character, but the very plenitude of the Priesthood.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But it is the sacrament of order that pertains to the sacramental agents:
    for it is by this sacrament that men are deputed to confer sacraments on
    others: while the sacrament of Baptism pertains to the recipients, since it
    confers on man the power to receive the other sacraments of the Church;
    whence it is called the "door of the sacraments." In a way Confirmation also
    is ordained for the same purpose, as we shall explain in its proper place
    (<a href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Consequently, these
    three sacraments imprint a character, namely, Baptism, Confirmation, and
    order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Every sacrament makes man of the a
    participator in Christ's Priesthood, from the fact that it confers on him
    some effect thereof. But every sacrament does not depute a man to do or
    receive something pertaining to the worship of the priesthood of Christ:
    while it is just this that is required for a sacrament to imprint a
    character.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man is sanctified by each of the
    sacraments, since sanctity means immunity from sin, which is the effect of
    grace. But in a special way some sacraments, which imprint a character,
    bestow on man a certain consecration, thus deputing him to the Divine
    worship: just as inanimate things are said to be consecrated forasmuch as
    they are deputed to Divine worship.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although a character is a reality and a
    sacrament, it does not follow that whatever is a reality and a sacrament, is
    also a character. With regard to the other sacraments we shall explain
    further on what is the reality and what is the sacrament.<br />
