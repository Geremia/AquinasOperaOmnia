<H3 Align="Center">TREATISE ON THE INCARNATION (Questions [1]-59)<br>
<br>
OF THE FITNESS OF THE INCARNATION (SIX ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the first, three things occur to be considered: first, the 
fitness of the Incarnation; secondly, the mode of union of the Word 
Incarnate; thirdly, what follows this union.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are six points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP001.html#TPQ1A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is fitting for God to become incarnate?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP001.html#TPQ1A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it was necessary for the restoration of the human race?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP001.html#TPQ1A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether if there had been no sin God would have become incarnate?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP001.html#TPQ1A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether He became incarnate to take away original sin rather than 
actual?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP001.html#TPQ1A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether it was fitting for God to become incarnate from the 
beginning of the world?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP001.html#TPQ1A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether His Incarnation ought to have been deferred to the end of 
the world?<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not fitting for God to become 
incarnate. Since God from all eternity is the very essence of goodness, 
it was best for Him to be as He had been from all eternity. But from all 
eternity He had been without flesh. Therefore it was most fitting for Him 
not to be united to flesh. Therefore it was not fitting for God to become 
incarnate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is not fitting to unite things that are  infinitely 
apart, even as it would not be a fitting union if one were "to paint a 
figure in which the neck of a horse was joined to the head of a man" 
[*Horace, Ars. Poet., line 1]. But God and flesh are infinitely apart; 
since God is most simple, and flesh is most composite---especially human 
flesh. Therefore it was not fitting that God should be united to human 
flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a body is as distant from the highest spirit as evil is 
from the highest good. But it was wholly unfitting that God, Who is the 
highest good, should assume evil. Therefore it was not fitting that the 
highest uncreated spirit should assume a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is not becoming that He Who surpassed the greatest 
things should be contained in the least, and He upon Whom rests the care 
of great things should leave them for lesser things. But God---Who takes 
care of the whole world---the whole universe of things cannot contain. 
Therefore it would seem unfitting that "He should be hid under the frail 
body of a babe in swathing bands, in comparison with Whom the whole 
universe is accounted as little; and that this Prince should quit His 
throne for so long, and transfer the government of the whole world to so 
frail a body," as Volusianus writes to Augustine (Ep. cxxxv).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It would seem most fitting that by visible things the 
invisible things of God should be made known; for to this end was the 
whole world made, as is clear from the word of the Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A20">Rm. 1:20</a>): 
"For the invisible things of God . . . are clearly seen, being understood 
by the things that are made." But, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 
1), by the mystery of the Incarnation are made known at once the 
goodness, the wisdom, the justice, and the power or might of God---"His 
goodness, for He did not despise the weakness of His own handiwork; His 
justice, since, on man's defeat, He caused the tyrant to be overcome by 
none other than man, and yet He did not snatch men forcibly from death; 
His wisdom, for He found a suitable discharge for a most heavy debt; His 
power, or infinite might, for there is nothing greater than for God to 
become incarnate . . ."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> To each things, that is befitting which belongs to it by 
reason of its very nature; thus, to reason befits man, since this belongs 
to him because he is of a rational nature. But the very nature of God is 
goodness, as is clear from Dionysius (Div. Nom. i). Hence, what belongs 
to the essence of goodness befits God. But it belongs to the essence of 
goodness to communicate itself to others, as is plain from Dionysius 
(Div. Nom. iv). Hence it belongs to the essence of the highest good to 
communicate itself in the highest manner to the creature, and this is 
brought about chiefly by "His so joining created nature to Himself that 
one Person is made up of these three---the Word, a soul and flesh," as 
Augustine says (De Trin. xiii). Hence it is manifest that it was fitting 
that God should become incarnate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The mystery of the Incarnation was not completed through 
God being changed in any way from the state in which He had  been from 
eternity, but through His having united Himself to the creature in a new 
way, or rather through having united it to Himself. But it is fitting 
that a creature which by nature is mutable, should not always be in one 
way. And therefore, as the creature began to be, although it had not been 
before, so likewise, not having been previously united to God in Person, 
it was afterwards united to Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To be united to God in unity of person was not fitting to 
human flesh, according to its natural endowments, since it was above its 
dignity; nevertheless, it was fitting that God, by reason of His infinite 
goodness, should unite it to Himself for man's salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Every mode of being wherein any creature whatsoever differs 
from the Creator has been established by God's wisdom, and is ordained to 
God's goodness. For God, Who is uncreated, immutable, and incorporeal, 
produced mutable and corporeal creatures for His own goodness. And so 
also the evil of punishment was established by God's justice for God's 
glory. But evil of fault is committed by withdrawing from the art of the 
Divine wisdom and from the order of the Divine goodness. And therefore it 
could be fitting to God to assume a nature created, mutable, corporeal, 
and subject to penalty, but it did not become Him to assume the evil of 
fault.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Augustine replies (Ep. ad Volusian. cxxxvii): "The 
Christian doctrine nowhere holds that God was so joined to human flesh as 
either to desert or lose, or to transfer and as it were, contract within 
this frail body, the care of governing the universe. This is the thought 
of men unable to see anything but corporeal things . . . God is great not 
in mass, but in might. Hence the greatness of His might feels no straits 
in narrow surroundings. Nor, if the passing word of a man is heard at 
once by many, and wholly by each, is it incredible that the abiding Word 
of God should be everywhere at once?" Hence nothing unfitting arises from 
God becoming incarnate.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it was necessary for the restoration of the human race that the Word of God should become incarnate?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not necessary for the reparation of the 
human race that the Word of God should become incarnate. For since the 
Word of God is perfect God, as has been said (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP004.html#FPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP004.html#FPQ4ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), no 
power was added to Him by the assumption of flesh. Therefore, if the 
incarnate Word of God restored human nature. He could also have restored 
it without assuming flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, for the restoration of human nature, which had fallen 
through sin, nothing more is required than that man should satisfy for 
sin. Now man can satisfy, as it would seem, for sin; for God cannot 
require from man more than man can do, and since He is more inclined to 
be merciful than to punish, as He lays the act  of sin to man's charge, 
so He ought to credit him with the contrary act. Therefore it was not 
necessary for the restoration of human nature that the Word of God should 
become incarnate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to revere God pertains especially to man's salvation; 
hence it is written (Mal. 1:6): "If, then, I be a father, where is my 
honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear?" But men revere God the 
more by considering Him as elevated above all, and far beyond man's 
senses, hence (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++112%3A4">Ps. 112:4</a>) it is written: "The Lord is high above all 
nations, and His glory above the heavens"; and farther on: "Who is as the 
Lord our God?" which pertains to reverence. Therefore it would seem 
unfitting to man's salvation that God should be made like unto us by 
assuming flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> What frees the human race from perdition is necessary 
for the salvation of man. But the mystery of the Incarnation is such; 
according to Jn. 3:16: "God so loved the world as to give His 
only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but 
may have life everlasting." Therefore it was necessary for man's 
salvation that God should become incarnate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[2] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing is said to be necessary for a certain end in two 
ways. First, when the end cannot be without it; as food is necessary for 
the preservation of human life. Secondly, when the end is attained better 
and more conveniently, as a horse is necessary for a journey. In the 
first way it was not necessary that God should become incarnate for the 
restoration of human nature. For God with His omnipotent power could have 
restored human nature in many other ways. But in the second way it was 
necessary that God should become incarnate for the restoration of human 
nature. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 10): "We shall also show that 
other ways were not wanting to God, to Whose power all things are equally 
subject; but that there was not a more fitting way of healing our misery."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[2] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this may be viewed with respect to our "furtherance in good." First, 
with regard to faith, which is made more certain by believing God Himself 
Who speaks; hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 2): "In order that man 
might journey more trustfully toward the truth, the Truth itself, the Son 
of God, having assumed human nature, established and founded faith." 
Secondly, with regard to hope, which is thereby greatly strengthened; 
hence Augustine says (De Trin. xiii): "Nothing was so necessary for 
raising our hope as to show us how deeply God loved us. And what could 
afford us a stronger proof of this than that the Son of God should become 
a partner with us of human nature?" Thirdly, with regard to charity, 
which is greatly enkindled by this; hence Augustine says (De Catech. 
Rudib. iv): "What greater cause is there of the Lord's coming than to 
show God's love for us?" And he afterwards adds: "If we have been slow to 
love, at least let us hasten to love in return." Fourthly, with regard to 
well-doing, in which He set us an example; hence Augustine says in a 
sermon (xxii de Temp.): "Man who might be seen was not to be followed; 
but God was to be followed, Who could not be seen. And therefore God was 
made man, that He Who  might be seen by man, and Whom man might follow, 
might be shown to man." Fifthly, with regard to the full participation of 
the Divinity, which is the true bliss of man and end of human life; and 
this is bestowed upon us by Christ's humanity; for Augustine says in a 
sermon (xiii de Temp.): "Go was made man, that man might be made God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[2] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; So also was this useful for our "withdrawal from evil." First, because 
man is taught by it not to prefer the devil to himself, nor to honor him 
who is the author of sin; hence Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 17): 
"Since human nature is so united to God as to become one person, let not 
these proud spirits dare to prefer themselves to man, because they have 
no bodies." Secondly, because we are thereby taught how great is man's 
dignity, lest we should sully it with sin; hence Augustine says (De Vera 
Relig. xvi): "God has proved to us how high a place human nature holds 
amongst creatures, inasmuch as He appeared to men as a true man." And 
Pope Leo says in a sermon on the Nativity (xxi): "Learn, O Christian, thy 
worth; and being made a partner of the Divine nature, refuse to return by 
evil deeds to your former worthlessness." Thirdly, because, "in order to 
do away with man's presumption, the grace of God is commended in Jesus 
Christ, though no merits of ours went before," as Augustine says (De 
Trin. xiii, 17). Fourthly, because "man's pride, which is the greatest 
stumbling-block to our clinging to God, can be convinced and cured by 
humility so great," as Augustine says in the same place. Fifthly, in 
order to free man from the thraldom of sin, which, as Augustine says (De 
Trin. xiii, 13), "ought to be done in such a way that the devil should be 
overcome by the justice of the man Jesus Christ," and this was done by 
Christ satisfying for us. Now a mere man could not have satisfied for the 
whole human race, and God was not bound to satisfy; hence it behooved 
Jesus Christ to be both God and man. Hence Pope Leo says in the same 
sermon: "Weakness is assumed by strength, lowliness by majesty, mortality 
by eternity, in order that one and the same Mediator of God and men might 
die in one and rise in the other---for this was our fitting remedy. 
Unless He was God, He would not have brought a remedy; and unless He was 
man, He would not have set an example."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[2] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And there are very many other advantages which accrued, above man's 
apprehension.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This reason has to do with the first kind of necessity, 
without which we cannot attain to the end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Satisfaction may be said to be sufficient in two 
ways---first, perfectly, inasmuch as it is condign, being adequate to 
make good the fault committed, and in this way the satisfaction of a mere 
man cannot be sufficient for sin, both because the whole of human nature 
has been corrupted by sin, whereas the goodness of any person or persons 
could not be made up adequately for the harm done to the whole of the 
nature; and also because a sin committed against God has a kind of 
infinity from the infinity of the Divine majesty, because the greater the 
person we offend, the more  grievous the offense. Hence for condign 
satisfaction it was necessary that the act of the one satisfying should 
have an infinite efficiency, as being of God and man. Secondly, man's 
satisfaction may be termed sufficient, imperfectly---i.e. in the 
acceptation of him who is content with it, even though it is not condign, 
and in this way the satisfaction of a mere man is sufficient. And 
forasmuch as every imperfect presupposes some perfect thing, by which it 
is sustained, hence it is that satisfaction of every mere man has its 
efficiency from the satisfaction of Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> By taking flesh, God did not lessen His majesty; and in 
consequence did not lessen the reason for reverencing Him, which is 
increased by the increase of knowledge of Him. But, on the contrary, 
inasmuch as He wished to draw nigh to us by taking flesh, He greatly drew 
us to know Him.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether, if man had not sinned, God would have become incarnate?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that if man had not sinned, God would still have 
become incarnate. For the cause remaining, the effect also remains. But 
as Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 17): "Many other things are to be 
considered in the Incarnation of Christ besides absolution from sin"; and 
these were discussed above (<A Href="TP001.html#TPQ1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore if man had not sinned, God 
would have become incarnate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to the omnipotence of the Divine power to 
perfect His works, and to manifest Himself by some infinite effect. But 
no mere creature can be called an infinite effect, since it is finite of 
its very essence. Now, seemingly, in the work of the Incarnation alone is 
an infinite effect of the Divine power manifested in a special manner by 
which power things infinitely distant are united, inasmuch as it has been 
brought about that man is God. And in this work especially the universe 
would seem to be perfected, inasmuch as the last creature---viz. man---is 
united to the first principle---viz. God. Therefore, even if man had not 
sinned, God would have become incarnate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, human nature has not been made more capable of grace by 
sin. But after sin it is capable of the grace of union, which is the 
greatest grace. Therefore, if man had not sinned, human nature would have 
been capable of this grace; nor would God have withheld from human nature 
any good it was capable of. Therefore, if man had not sinned, God would 
have become incarnate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, God's predestination is eternal. But it is said of 
Christ (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A4">Rm. 1:4</a>): "Who was predestined the Son of God in power." 
Therefore, even before sin, it was necessary that the Son of God should 
become incarnate, in order to fulfil God's predestination.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the mystery of the Incarnation was revealed to the first 
man, as is plain from Gn. 2:23. "This now is bone of my  bones," etc. 
which the Apostle says is "a great sacrament . . . in Christ and in the 
Church," as is plain from Eph. 5:32. But man could not be fore-conscious 
of his fall, for the same reason that the angels could not, as Augustine 
proves (Gen. ad lit. xi, 18). Therefore, even if man had not sinned, God 
would have become incarnate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Verb. Apost. viii, 2), expounding 
what is set down in Lk. 19:10, "For the Son of Man is come to seek and to 
save that which was lost"; "Therefore, if man had not sinned, the Son of 
Man would not have come." And on 1 Tim. 1:15, "Christ Jesus came into 
this world to save sinners," a gloss says, "There was no cause of 
Christ's coming into the world, except to save sinners. Take away 
diseases, take away wounds, and there is no need of medicine."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are different opinions about this question. For 
some say that even if man had not sinned, the Son of Man would have 
become incarnate. Others assert the contrary, and seemingly our assent 
ought rather to be given to this opinion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For such things as spring from God's will, and beyond the creature's 
due, can be made known to us only through being revealed in the Sacred 
Scripture, in which the Divine Will is made known to us. Hence, since 
everywhere in the Sacred Scripture the sin of the first man is assigned 
as the reason of the Incarnation, it is more in accordance with this to 
say that the work of the Incarnation was ordained by God as a remedy for 
sin; so that, had sin not existed, the Incarnation would not have been. 
And yet the power of God is not limited to this; even had sin not 
existed, God could have become incarnate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All the other causes which are assigned in the preceding 
article have to do with a remedy for sin. For if man had not sinned, he 
would have been endowed with the light of Divine wisdom, and would have 
been perfected by God with the righteousness of justice in order to know 
and carry out everything needful. But because man, on deserting God, had 
stooped to corporeal things, it was necessary that God should take flesh, 
and by corporeal things should afford him the remedy of salvation. Hence, 
on Jn. 1:14, "And the Word was made flesh," St. Augustine says (Tract. 
ii): "Flesh had blinded thee, flesh heals thee; for Christ came and 
overthrew the vices of the flesh."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The infinity of Divine power is shown in the mode of 
production of things from nothing. Again, it suffices for the perfection 
of the universe that the creature be ordained in a natural manner to God 
as to an end. But that a creature should be united to God in person 
exceeds the limits of the perfection of nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A double capability may be remarked in human nature: one, 
in respect of the order of natural power, and this is always fulfilled by 
God, Who apportions to each according to its  natural capability; the 
other in respect to the order of the Divine power, which all creatures 
implicitly obey; and the capability we speak of pertains to this. But God 
does not fulfil all such capabilities, otherwise God could do only what 
He has done in creatures, and this is false, as stated above (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP105.html#FPQ105OUTP1">Question [105]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP105.html#FPQ105A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). But there is no reason why human nature should not have been 
raised to something greater after sin. For God allows evils to happen in 
order to bring a greater good therefrom; hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A20">Rm. 5:20</a>): 
"Where sin abounded, grace did more abound." Hence, too, in the blessing 
of the Paschal candle, we say: "O happy fault, that merited such and so 
great a Redeemer!"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Predestination presupposes the foreknowledge of future 
things; and hence, as God predestines the salvation of anyone to be 
brought about by the prayers of others, so also He predestined the work 
of the Incarnation to be the remedy of human sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Nothing prevents an effect from being revealed to one to 
whom the cause is not revealed. Hence, the mystery of the Incarnation 
could be revealed to the first man without his being fore-conscious of 
his fall. For not everyone who knows the effect knows the cause.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God became incarnate in order to take away actual sin, rather than to take away original sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God became incarnate as a remedy for actual 
sins rather than for original sin. For the more grievous the sin, the 
more it runs counter to man's salvation, for which God became incarnate. 
But actual sin is more grievous than original sin; for the lightest 
punishment is due to original sin, as Augustine says (Contra Julian. v, 
11). Therefore the Incarnation of Christ is chiefly directed to taking 
away actual sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, pain of sense is not due to original sin, but merely 
pain of loss, as has been shown (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS087.html#FSQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS087.html#FSQ87A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). But Christ came to 
suffer the pain of sense on the Cross in satisfaction for sins---and not 
the pain of loss, for He had no defect of either the beatific vision or 
fruition. Therefore He came in order to take away actual sin rather than 
original sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as Chrysostom says (De Compunctione Cordis ii, 3): "This 
must be the mind of the faithful servant, to account the benefits of his 
Lord, which have been bestowed on all alike, as though they were bestowed 
on himself alone. For as if speaking of himself alone, Paul writes to the 
Galatians 2:20: 'Christ . . . loved me and delivered Himself for me.'" 
But our individual sins are actual sins; for original sin is the common 
sin. Therefore we ought to have this conviction, so as to believe that He 
has come chiefly for actual sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++1%3A29">Jn. 1:29</a>): "Behold the Lamb of  God, 
behold Him Who taketh away the sins [Vulg.: 'sin'] of the world."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is certain that Christ came into this world not only 
to take away that sin which is handed on originally to posterity, but 
also in order to take away all sins subsequently added to it; not that 
all are taken away (and this is from men's fault, inasmuch as they do not 
adhere to Christ, according to Jn. 3:19: "The light is come into the 
world, and men loved darkness rather than the light"), but because He 
offered what was sufficient for blotting out all sins. Hence it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A15-16">Rm. 5:15-16</a>): "But not as the offense, so also the gift . . . 
For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation, but grace is of many 
offenses unto justification."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the more grievous the sin, the more particularly did Christ 
come to blot it out. But "greater" is said in two ways: in one way 
"intensively," as a more intense whiteness is said to be greater, and in 
this way actual sin is greater than original sin; for it has more of the 
nature of voluntary, as has been shown (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS081.html#FSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS081.html#FSQ81A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). In another way 
a thing is said to be greater "extensively," as whiteness on a greater 
superficies is said to be greater; and in this way original sin, whereby 
the whole human race is infected, is greater than any actual sin, which 
is proper to one person. And in this respect Christ came principally to 
take away original sin, inasmuch as "the good of the race is a more 
Divine thing than the good of an individual," as is said Ethic. i, 2.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This reason looks to the intensive greatness of sin.
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the future award the pain of sense will not be meted out 
to original sin. Yet the penalties, such as hunger, thirst, death, and 
the like, which we suffer sensibly in this life flow from original sin. 
And hence Christ, in order to satisfy fully for original sin, wished to 
suffer sensible pain, that He might consume death and the like in Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Chrysostom says (De Compunctione Cordis ii, 6): "The 
Apostle used these words, not as if wishing to diminish Christ's gifts, 
ample as they are, and spreading throughout the whole world, but that he 
might account himself alone the occasion of them. For what does it matter 
that they are given to others, if what are given to you are as complete 
and perfect as if none of them were given to another than yourself?" And 
hence, although a man ought to account Christ's gifts as given to 
himself, yet he ought not to consider them not to be given to others. And 
thus we do not exclude that He came to wipe away the sin of the whole 
nature rather than the sin of one person. But the sin of the nature is as 
perfectly healed in each one as if it were healed in him alone. Hence, on 
account of the union of charity, what is vouchsafed to all ought to be 
accounted his own by each one.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it was fitting that God should become incarnate in the beginning of the human race?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was fitting that God should become 
incarnate in the beginning of the human race. For the work of the 
Incarnation sprang from the immensity of Divine charity, according to 
Eph. 2:4,5: "But God (Who is rich in mercy), for His exceeding charity 
wherewith He loved us . . . even when we were dead in sins, hath 
quickened us together in Christ." But charity does not tarry in bringing 
assistance to a friend who is suffering need, according to Prov. 3:28: 
"Say not to thy friend: Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give to 
thee, when thou canst give at present." Therefore God ought not to have 
put off the work of the Incarnation, but ought thereby to have brought 
relief to the human race from the beginning.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++1%3A15">1 Tim. 1:15</a>): "Christ Jesus came into 
this world to save sinners." But more would have been saved had God 
become incarnate at the beginning of the human race; for in the various 
centuries very many, through not knowing God, perished in their sin. 
Therefore it was fitting that God should become incarnate at the 
beginning of the human race.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the work of grace is not less orderly than the work of 
nature. But nature takes its rise with the more perfect, as Boethius says 
(De Consol. iii). Therefore the work of Christ ought to have been perfect 
from the beginning. But in the work of the Incarnation we see the 
perfection of grace, according to Jn. 1:14: "The Word was made flesh"; 
and afterwards it is added: "Full of grace and truth." Therefore Christ 
ought to have become incarnate at the beginning of the human race.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++4%3A4">Gal. 4:4</a>): "But when the fulness of the 
time was come, God sent His Son, made of a woman, made under the law": 
upon which a gloss says that "the fulness of the time is when it was 
decreed by God the Father to send His Son." But God decreed everything by 
His wisdom. Therefore God became incarnate at the most fitting time; and 
it was not fitting that God should become incarnate at the beginning of 
the human race.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[5] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since the work of the Incarnation is principally ordained 
to the restoration of the human race by blotting out sin, it is manifest 
that it was not fitting for God to become incarnate at the beginning of 
the human race before sin. For medicine is given only to the sick. Hence 
our Lord Himself says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++9%3A12,13">Mt. 9:12,13</a>): "They that are in health need not a 
physician, but they that are ill . . . For I am not come to call the 
just, but sinners."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[5] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor was it fitting that God should become incarnate immediately after 
sin. First, on account of the manner of man's sin, which had come of 
pride; hence man was to be liberated in such a manner that he might be 
humbled, and see how he stood in need of a deliverer. Hence on the words 
in Gal. 3:19, "Being ordained by  angels in the hand of a mediator," a 
gloss says: "With great wisdom was it so ordered that the Son of Man 
should not be sent immediately after man's fall. For first of all God 
left man under the natural law, with the freedom of his will, in order 
that he might know his natural strength; and when he failed in it, he 
received the law; whereupon, by the fault, not of the law, but of his 
nature, the disease gained strength; so that having recognized his 
infirmity he might cry out for a physician, and beseech the aid of grace."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[5] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, on account of the order of furtherance in good, whereby we 
proceed from imperfection to perfection. Hence the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A46,47">1 Cor. 15:46,47</a>): "Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is 
natural; afterwards that which is spiritual . . . The first man was of 
the earth, earthy; the second man from heaven, heavenly."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[5] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, on account of the dignity of the incarnate Word, for on the 
words (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++4%3A4">Gal. 4:4</a>), "But when the fulness of the time was come," a gloss 
says: "The greater the judge who was coming, the more numerous was the 
band of heralds who ought to have preceded him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[5] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, lest the fervor of faith should cool by the length of time, 
for the charity of many will grow cold at the end of the world. Hence 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++18%3A8">Lk. 18:8</a>) it is written: "But yet the Son of Man, when He cometh, shall 
He find think you, faith on earth?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Charity does not put off bringing assistance to a friend: 
always bearing in mind the circumstances as well as the state of the 
persons. For if the physician were to give the medicine at the very 
outset of the ailment, it would do less good, and would hurt rather than 
benefit. And hence the Lord did not bestow upon the human race the remedy 
of the Incarnation in the beginning, lest they should despise it through 
pride, if they did not already recognize their disease.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine replies to this (De Sex Quest. Pagan., Ep. cii), 
saying (<A Href="TP002.html#TPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>) that "Christ wished to appear to man and to have His 
doctrine preached to them when and where He knew those were who would 
believe in Him. But in such times and places as His Gospel was not 
preached He foresaw that not all, indeed, but many would so bear 
themselves towards His preaching as not to believe in His corporeal 
presence, even were He to raise the dead." But the same Augustine, taking 
exception to this reply in his book (De Perseverantia ix), says: "How can 
we say the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon would not believe when such 
great wonders were wrought in their midst, or would not have believed had 
they been wrought, when God Himself bears witness that they would have 
done penance with great humility if these signs of Divine power had been 
wrought in their midst?" And he adds in answer (De Perseverantia xi): 
"Hence, as the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++9%3A16">Rm. 9:16</a>), 'it is not of him that willeth 
nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy'; Who (succors 
whom He will of) those who, as He foresaw, would believe in His  miracles 
if wrought amongst them, (while others) He succors not, having judged 
them in His predestination secretly yet justly. Therefore let us 
unshrinkingly believe His mercy to be with those who are set free, and 
His truth with those who are condemned." [*The words in brackets are not 
in the text of St. Augustine].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Perfection is prior to imperfection, both in time and 
nature, in things that are different (for what brings others to 
perfection must itself be perfect); but in one and the same, imperfection 
is prior in time though posterior in nature. And thus the eternal 
perfection of God precedes in duration the imperfection of human nature; 
but the latter's ultimate perfection in union with God follows.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the work of the Incarnation ought to have been 
put off till the end of the world. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++91%3A11">Ps. 91:11</a>): "My old 
age in plentiful mercy"---i.e. "in the last days," as a gloss says. But 
the time of the Incarnation is especially the time of mercy, according to 
Ps. 101:14: "For it is time to have mercy on it." Therefore the 
Incarnation ought to have been put off till the end of the world.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as has been said (<A Href="TP001.html#TPQ1A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 3), in the same subject, 
perfection is subsequent in time to imperfection. Therefore, what is most 
perfect ought to be the very last in time. But the highest perfection of 
human nature is in the union with the Word, because "in Christ it hath 
pleased the Father that all the fulness of the Godhead should dwell," as 
the Apostle says (Col. 1:19, and 2:9). Therefore the Incarnation ought to 
have been put off till the end of the world.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what can be done by one ought not to be done by two. But 
the one coming of Christ at the end of the world was sufficient for the 
salvation of human nature. Therefore it was not necessary for Him to come 
beforehand in His Incarnation; and hence the Incarnation ought to have 
been put off till the end of the world.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Hab. 3:2): "In the midst of the years 
Thou shalt make it known." Therefore the mystery of the Incarnation which 
was made known to the world ought not to have been put off till the end 
of the world.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[6] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As it was not fitting that God should become incarnate at 
the beginning of the world, so also it was not fitting that the 
Incarnation should be put off till the end of the world. And this is 
shown first from the union of the Divine and human nature. For, as it has 
been said (<A Href="TP001.html#TPQ1A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 3), perfection precedes imperfection in time in one 
way, and contrariwise in another way imperfection precedes perfection. 
For in that which is made perfect  from being imperfect, imperfection 
precedes perfection in time, whereas in that which is the efficient cause 
of perfection, perfection precedes imperfection in time. Now in the work 
of the Incarnation both concur; for by the Incarnation human nature is 
raised to its highest perfection; and in this way it was not becoming 
that the Incarnation should take place at the beginning of the human 
race. And the Word incarnate is the efficient cause of the perfection of 
human nature, according to Jn. 1:16: "Of His fulness we have all 
received"; and hence the work of the Incarnation ought not to have been 
put off till the end of the world. But the perfection of glory to which 
human nature is to be finally raised by the Word Incarnate will be at the 
end of the world.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[6] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, from the effect of man's salvation; for, as is said Qq. Vet et 
Nov. Test., qu. 83, "it is in the power of the Giver to have pity when, 
or as much as, He wills. Hence He came when He knew it was fitting to 
succor, and when His boons would be welcome. For when by the feebleness 
of the human race men's knowledge of God began to grow dim and their 
morals lax, He was pleased to choose Abraham as a standard of the 
restored knowledge of God and of holy living; and later on when reverence 
grew weaker, He gave the law to Moses in writing; and because the 
gentiles despised it and would not take it upon themselves, and they who 
received it would not keep it, being touched with pity, God sent His Son, 
to grant to all remission of their sin and to offer them, justified, to 
God the Father." But if this remedy had been put off till the end of the 
world, all knowledge and reverence of God and all uprightness of morals 
would have been swept away from the earth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[6] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, this appears fitting to the manifestation of the Divine power, 
which has saved men in several ways---not only by faith in some future 
thing, but also by faith in something present and past.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This gloss has in view the mercy of God, which leads us to 
glory. Nevertheless, if it is referred to the mercy shown the human race 
by the Incarnation of Christ, we must reflect that, as Augustine says 
(Retract. i), the time of the Incarnation may be compared to the youth of 
the human race, "on account of the strength and fervor of faith, which 
works by charity"; and to old age---i.e. the sixth age---on account of 
the number of centuries, for Christ came in the sixth age. And although 
youth and old age cannot be together in a body, yet they can be together 
in a soul, the former on account of quickness, the latter on account of 
gravity. And hence Augustine says elsewhere (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 44) that 
"it was not becoming that the Master by Whose imitation the human race 
was to be formed to the highest virtue should come from heaven, save in 
the time of youth." But in another work (De Gen. cont. Manich. i, 23) he 
says: that Christ came in the sixth age---i.e. in the old age---of the 
human race.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[1] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The work of the Incarnation is to be viewed not as merely 
the terminus of a movement from imperfection to  perfection, but also as 
a principle of perfection to human nature, as has been said.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Chrysostom says on Jn. 3:11, "For God sent not His Son 
into the world to judge the world" (Hom. xxviii): "There are two comings 
of Christ: the first, for the remission of sins; the second, to judge the 
world. For if He had not done so, all would have perished together, since 
all have sinned and need the glory of God." Hence it is plain that He 
ought not to have put off the coming in mercy till the end of the world.<br>
