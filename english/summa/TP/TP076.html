</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider the manner in which Christ exists in this 
sacrament; and under this head there are eight points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the whole Christ is under this sacrament?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the entire Christ is under each species of the sacrament?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the entire Christ is under every part of the species?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether all the dimensions of Christ's body are in this sacrament?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether the body of Christ is in this sacrament locally?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether after the consecration, the body of Christ is moved when the 
host or chalice is moved?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether Christ's body, as it is in this sacrament, can be seen by 
the eye?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether the true body of Christ remains in this sacrament when He is 
seen under the appearance of a child or of flesh?<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the whole Christ is not contained under this 
sacrament, because Christ begins to be in this sacrament by conversion of 
the bread and wine. But it is evident that the bread and wine cannot be 
changed either into the Godhead or into the soul of Christ. Since 
therefore Christ exists in three substances, namely, the Godhead, soul 
and body, as shown above (<A Href="TP002.html#TPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="TP002.html#TPQ2A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="TP005.html#TPQ5OUTP1">Question [5]</a>,  <A Href="TP005.html#TPQ5ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3), it seems that the 
entire Christ is not under this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ is in this sacrament, forasmuch as it is ordained 
to the refection of the faithful, which consists in food and drink, as 
stated above (<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>, <A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But our Lord said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++6:56">Jn. 6:56</a>): "My flesh is 
meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed." Therefore, only the flesh and 
blood of Christ are contained in this sacrament. But there are many other 
parts of Christ's body, for instance, the nerves, bones, and such like. 
Therefore the entire Christ is not contained under this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a body of greater quantity cannot be contained under the 
measure of a lesser. But the measure of the bread and wine is much 
smaller than the measure of Christ's body. Therefore it is impossible 
that the entire Christ be contained under this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Officiis): "Christ is in this 
sacrament."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is absolutely necessary to confess according to 
Catholic faith that the entire Christ is in this sacrament. Yet we must 
know that there is something of Christ in this sacrament in a twofold 
manner: first, as it were, by the power of the sacrament; secondly, from 
natural concomitance. By the power of the sacrament, there is under the 
species of this sacrament that into which the pre-existing substance of 
the bread and wine is changed, as expressed by the words of the form, 
which are effective in this as in the other sacraments; for instance, by 
the words: "This is My body," or, "This is My blood." But from natural 
concomitance there is also in this sacrament that which is really united 
with that thing wherein the aforesaid conversion is terminated. For if 
any two things be really united, then wherever the one is really, there 
must the other also be: since things really united together are only 
distinguished by an operation of the mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Because the change of the bread and wine is not terminated 
at the Godhead or the soul of Christ, it follows as a consequence that 
the Godhead or the soul of Christ is in this sacrament not by the power 
of the sacrament, but from real concomitance. For since the Godhead never 
set aside the assumed body, wherever the body of Christ is, there, of 
necessity, must the Godhead be; and therefore it is necessary for the 
Godhead to be in this sacrament concomitantly with His body. Hence we 
read in the profession of faith at Ephesus (P. I., chap. xxvi): "We are 
made partakers of the body and blood of Christ, not as taking common 
flesh, nor as of a holy man united to the Word in dignity, but the truly 
life-giving flesh of the Word Himself."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, His soul was truly separated from His body, as stated 
above (<A Href="TP050.html#TPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>, <A Href="TP050.html#TPQ50A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). And therefore had this sacrament been celebrated 
during those three days when He was dead, the soul of Christ would not 
have been there, neither by the power of the  sacrament, nor from real 
concomitance. But since "Christ rising from the dead dieth now no more" 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++6:9">Rm. 6:9</a>), His soul is always really united with His body. And therefore 
in this sacrament the body indeed of Christ is present by the power of 
the sacrament, but His soul from real concomitance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By the power of the sacrament there is contained under it, 
as to the species of the bread, not only the flesh, but the entire body 
of Christ, that is, the bones the nerves, and the like. And this is 
apparent from the form of this sacrament, wherein it is not said: "This 
is My flesh," but "This is My body." Accordingly, when our Lord said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++6:56">Jn. 6:56</a>): "My flesh is meat indeed," there the word flesh is put for the 
entire body, because according to human custom it seems to be more 
adapted for eating, as men commonly are fed on the flesh of animals, but 
not on the bones or the like.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As has been already stated (<A Href="TP075.html#TPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>, <A Href="TP075.html#TPQ75A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), after the 
consecration of the bread into the body of Christ, or of the wine into 
His blood, the accidents of both remain. From which it is evident that 
the dimensions of the bread or wine are not changed into the dimensions 
of the body of Christ, but substance into substance. And so the substance 
of Christ's body or blood is under this sacrament by the power of the 
sacrament, but not the dimensions of Christ's body or blood. Hence it is 
clear that the body of Christ is in this sacrament "by way of substance," 
and not by way of quantity. But the proper totality of substance is 
contained indifferently in a small or large quantity; as the whole nature 
of air in a great or small amount of air, and the whole nature of a man 
in a big or small individual. Wherefore, after the consecration, the 
whole substance of Christ's body and blood is contained in this 
sacrament, just as the whole substance of the bread and wine was 
contained there before the consecration.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the whole Christ is not contained under both 
species of this sacrament. For this sacrament is ordained for the 
salvation of the faithful, not by virtue of the species, but by virtue of 
what is contained under the species, because the species were there even 
before the consecration, from which comes the power of this sacrament. If 
nothing, then, be contained under one species, but what is contained 
under the other, and if the whole Christ be contained under both, it 
seems that one of them is superfluous in this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it was stated above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1) that all the other 
parts of the body, such as the bones, nerves, and the like, are comprised 
under the name of flesh. But the blood is one of the parts of the human 
body, as Aristotle proves (De Anima Histor. i). If, then, Christ's blood 
be contained under the species of bread, just as the other parts of the 
body are contained there, the blood  ought not to be consecrated apart, 
just as no other part of the body is consecrated separately.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is once "in being" cannot be again "in becoming." 
But Christ's body has already begun to be in this sacrament by the 
consecration of the bread. Therefore, it cannot begin again to be there 
by the consecration of the wine; and so Christ's body will not be 
contained under the species of the wine, and accordingly neither the 
entire Christ. Therefore the whole Christ is not contained under each 
species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The gloss on 1 Cor. 11:25, commenting on the word 
"Chalice," says that "under each species," namely, of the bread and wine, 
"the same is received"; and thus it seems that Christ is entire under 
each species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> After what we have said above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it must be held 
most certainly that the whole Christ is under each sacramental species 
yet not alike in each. For the body of Christ is indeed present under the 
species of bread by the power of the sacrament, while the blood is there 
from real concomitance, as stated above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1) in regard to the 
soul and Godhead of Christ; and under the species of wine the blood is 
present by the power of the sacrament, and His body by real concomitance, 
as is also His soul and Godhead: because now Christ's blood is not 
separated from His body, as it was at the time of His Passion and death. 
Hence if this sacrament had been celebrated then, the body of Christ 
would have been under the species of the bread, but without the blood; 
and, under the species of the wine, the blood would have been present 
without the body, as it was then, in fact.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the whole Christ is under each species, yet it is 
so not without purpose. For in the first place this serves to represent 
Christ's Passion, in which the blood was separated from the body; hence 
in the form for the consecration of the blood mention is made of its 
shedding. Secondly, it is in keeping with the use of this sacrament, that 
Christ's body be shown apart to the faithful as food, and the blood as 
drink. Thirdly, it is in keeping with its effect, in which sense it was 
stated above (<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>, <A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that "the body is offered for the salvation of 
the body, and the blood for the salvation of the soul."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In Christ's Passion, of which this is the memorial, the 
other parts of the body were not separated from one another, as the blood 
was, but the body remained entire, according to Ex. 12:46: "You shall not 
break a bone thereof." And therefore in this sacrament the blood is 
consecrated apart from the body, but no other part is consecrated 
separately from the rest.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above, the body of Christ is not under the 
species of wine by the power of the sacrament, but by real concomitance: 
and therefore by the consecration of the wine the body of Christ is not 
there of itself, but concomitantly.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ is entire under every part of the species of the bread and wine?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Christ is not entire under every part of the 
species of bread and wine. Because those species can be divided 
infinitely. If therefore Christ be entirely under every part of the said 
species, it would follow that He is in this sacrament an infinite number 
of times: which is unreasonable; because the infinite is repugnant not 
only to nature, but likewise to grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, since Christ's is an organic body, it has parts 
determinately distant. for a determinate distance of the individual parts 
from each other is of the very nature of an organic body, as that of eye 
from eye, and eye from ear. But this could not be so, if Christ were 
entire under every part of the species; for every part would have to be 
under every other part, and so where one part would be, there another 
part would be. It cannot be then that the entire Christ is under every 
part of the host or of the wine contained in the chalice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ's body always retains the true nature of a body, 
nor is it ever changed into a spirit. Now it is the nature of a body for 
it to be "quantity having position" (Predic. iv). But it belongs to the 
nature of this quantity that the various parts exist in various parts of 
place. Therefore, apparently it is impossible for the entire Christ to be 
under every part of the species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says in a sermon (Gregory, Sacramentarium): 
"Each receives Christ the Lord, Who is entire under every morsel, nor is 
He less in each portion, but bestows Himself entire under each."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was observed above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3), because the substance 
of Christ's body is in this sacrament by the power of the sacrament, 
while dimensive quantity is there by reason of real concomitance, 
consequently Christ's body is in this sacrament substantively, that is, 
in the way in which substance is under dimensions, but not after the 
manner of dimensions, which means, not in the way in which the dimensive 
quantity of a body is under the dimensive quantity of place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is evident that the whole nature of a substance is under every 
part of the dimensions under which it is contained; just as the entire 
nature of air is under every part of air, and the entire nature of bread 
under every part of bread; and this indifferently, whether the dimensions 
be actually divided (as when the air is divided or the bread cut), or 
whether they be actually undivided, but potentially divisible. And 
therefore it is manifest that the entire Christ is under every part of 
the species of the bread, even while the host remains entire, and not 
merely when it is broken, as some say, giving the example of an image 
which appears in a mirror, which appears as one in the unbroken mirror,  
whereas when the mirror is broken, there is an image in each part of the 
broken mirror: for the comparison is not perfect, because the multiplying 
of such images results in the broken mirror on account of the various 
reflections in the various parts of the mirror; but here there is only 
one consecration, whereby Christ's body is in this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Number follows division, and therefore so long as quantity 
remains actually undivided, neither is the substance of any thing several 
times under its proper dimensions, nor is Christ's body several times 
under the dimensions of the bread; and consequently not an infinite 
number of times, but just as many times as it is divided into parts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The determinate distance of parts in an organic body is 
based upon its dimensive quantity; but the nature of substance precedes 
even dimensive quantity. And since the conversion of the substance of the 
bread is terminated at the substance of the body of Christ, and since 
according to the manner of substance the body of Christ is properly and 
directly in this sacrament; such distance of parts is indeed in Christ's 
true body, which, however, is not compared to this sacrament according to 
such distance, but according to the manner of its substance, as stated 
above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument is based on the nature of a body, arising 
from dimensive quantity. But it was said above (ad 2) that Christ's body 
is compared with this sacrament not by reason of dimensive quantity, but 
by reason of its substance, as already stated.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the whole dimensive quantity of Christ's body is in this sacrament?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the whole dimensive quantity of Christ's body is 
not in this sacrament. For it was said (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that Christ's entire body 
is contained under every part of the consecrated host. But no dimensive 
quantity is contained entirely in any whole, and in its every part. 
Therefore it is impossible for the entire dimensive quantity of Christ's 
body to be there.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is impossible for two dimensive quantities to be 
together, even though one be separate from its subject, and the other in 
a natural body, as is clear from the Philosopher (Metaph. iii). But the 
dimensive quantity of the bread remains in this sacrament, as is evident 
to our senses. Consequently, the dimensive quantity of Christ's body is 
not there.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if two unequal dimensive quantities be set side by side, 
the greater will overlap the lesser. But the dimensive quantity of 
Christ's body is considerably larger than the dimensive quantity of the 
consecrated host according to every dimension. Therefore, if the 
dimensive quantity of Christ's body be  in this sacrament together with 
the dimensive quantity of the host, the dimensive quantity of Christ's 
body is extended beyond the quantity of the host, which nevertheless is 
not without the substance of Christ's body. Therefore, the substance of 
Christ's body will be in this sacrament even outside the species of the 
bread, which is unreasonable, since the substance of Christ's body is in 
this sacrament, only by the consecration of the bread, as stated above 
(<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Consequently, it is impossible for the whole dimensive quantity 
of Christ's body to be in this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The existence of the dimensive quantity of any body 
cannot be separated from the existence of its substance. But in this 
sacrament the entire substance of Christ's body is present, as stated 
above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3). Therefore the entire dimensive quantity of Christ's body 
is in this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), any part of Christ is in this 
sacrament in two ways: in one way, by the power of the sacrament; in 
another, from real concomitance. By the power of the sacrament the 
dimensive quantity of Christ's body is not in this sacrament; for, by the 
power of the sacrament that is present in this sacrament, whereat the 
conversion is terminated. But the conversion which takes place in this 
sacrament is terminated directly at the substance of Christ's body, and 
not at its dimensions; which is evident from the fact that the dimensive 
quantity of the bread remains after the consecration, while only the 
substance of the bread passes away.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, since the substance of Christ's body is not really 
deprived of its dimensive quantity and its other accidents, hence it 
comes that by reason of real concomitance the whole dimensive quantity of 
Christ's body and all its other accidents are in this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The manner of being of every thing is determined by what 
belongs to it of itself, and not according to what is coupled 
accidentally with it: thus an object is present to the sight, according 
as it is white, and not according as it is sweet, although the same 
object may be both white and sweet; hence sweetness is in the sight after 
the manner of whiteness, and not after that of sweetness. Since, then, 
the substance of Christ's body is present on the altar by the power of 
this sacrament, while its dimensive quantity is there concomitantly and 
as it were accidentally, therefore the dimensive quantity of Christ's 
body is in this sacrament, not according to its proper manner (namely, 
that the whole is in the whole, and the individual parts in individual 
parts), but after the manner of substance, whose nature is for the whole 
to be in the whole, and the whole in every part.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Two dimensive quantities cannot naturally be in the same 
subject at the same time, so that each be there according to the proper 
manner of dimensive quantity. But in this sacrament the dimensive 
quantity of the bread is there after its proper manner, that is, 
according to commensuration: not so the dimensive  quantity of Christ's 
body, for that is there after the manner of substance, as stated above 
(ad 1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The dimensive quantity of Christ's body is in this 
sacrament not by way of commensuration, which is proper to quantity, and 
to which it belongs for the greater to be extended beyond the lesser; but 
in the way mentioned above (ad 1,2).<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Christ's body is in this sacrament as in a place. 
Because, to be in a place definitively or circumscriptively belongs to 
being in a place. But Christ's body seems to be definitively in this 
sacrament, because it is so present where the species of the bread and 
wine are, that it is nowhere else upon the altar: likewise it seems to be 
there circumscriptively, because it is so contained under the species of 
the consecrated host, that it neither exceeds it nor is exceeded by it. 
Therefore Christ's body is in this sacrament as in a place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the place of the bread and wine is not empty, because 
nature abhors a vacuum; nor is the substance of the bread there, as 
stated above (<A Href="TP075.html#TPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>, <A Href="TP075.html#TPQ75A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); but only the body of Christ is there. 
Consequently the body of Christ fills that place. But whatever fills a 
place is there locally. Therefore the body of Christ is in this sacrament 
locally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the body of Christ is in this 
sacrament with its dimensive quantity, and with all its accidents. But to 
be in a place is an accident of a body; hence "where" is numbered among 
the nine kinds of accidents. Therefore Christ's body is in this sacrament 
locally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The place and the object placed must be equal, as is 
clear from the Philosopher (Phys. iv). But the place, where this 
sacrament is, is much less than the body of Christ. Therefore Christ's 
body is not in this sacrament as in a place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), Christ's body is in 
this sacrament not after the proper manner of dimensive quantity, but 
rather after the manner of substance. But every body occupying a place is 
in the place according to the manner of dimensive quantity, namely, 
inasmuch as it is commensurate with the place according to its dimensive 
quantity. Hence it remains that Christ's body is not in this sacrament as 
in a place, but after the manner of substance, that is to say, in that 
way in which substance is contained by dimensions; because the substance 
of Christ's body succeeds the substance of bread in this sacrament: hence 
as the substance of bread was not locally under its dimensions, but after 
the manner of substance, so neither is the substance of Christ's body. 
Nevertheless the substance of Christ's body is not the subject of those 
dimensions, as was the substance of the bread: and therefore the 
substance of the bread was there locally by reason of  its dimensions, 
because it was compared with that place through the medium of its own 
dimensions; but the substance of Christ's body is compared with that 
place through the medium of foreign dimensions, so that, on the contrary, 
the proper dimensions of Christ's body are compared with that place 
through the medium of substance; which is contrary to the notion of a 
located body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence in no way is Christ's body locally in this sacrament.
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ's body is not in this sacrament definitively, 
because then it would be only on the particular altar where this 
sacrament is performed: whereas it is in heaven under its own species, 
and on many other altars under the sacramental species. Likewise it is 
evident that it is not in this sacrament circumscriptively, because it is 
not there according to the commensuration of its own quantity, as stated 
above. But that it is not outside the superficies of the sacrament, nor 
on any other part of the altar, is due not to its being there 
definitively or circumscriptively, but to its being there by consecration 
and conversion of the bread and wine, as stated above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="TP015.html#TPQ15OUTP1">Question [15]</a>, <A Href="TP015.html#TPQ15A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, sqq.).
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The place in which Christ's body is, is not empty; nor yet 
is it properly filled with the substance of Christ's body, which is not 
there locally, as stated above; but it is filled with the sacramental 
species, which have to fill the place either because of the nature of 
dimensions, or at least miraculously, as they also subsist miraculously 
after the fashion of substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the accidents of Christ's body are 
in this sacrament by real concomitance. And therefore those accidents of 
Christ's body which are intrinsic to it are in this sacrament. But to be 
in a place is an accident when compared with the extrinsic container. And 
therefore it is not necessary for Christ to be in this sacrament as in a 
place.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Christ's body is movably in this sacrament, because 
the Philosopher says (Topic. ii) that "when we are moved, the things 
within us are moved": and this is true even of the soul's spiritual 
substance. "But Christ is in this sacrament," as shown above (<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>, <A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore He is moved when it is moved.
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the truth ought to correspond with the figure. But, 
according to the commandment (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++12:10">Ex. 12:10</a>), concerning the Paschal Lamb, a 
figure of this sacrament, "there remained nothing until the morning." 
Neither, therefore, if this sacrament be reserved until morning, will 
Christ's body be there; and so it is not immovably in this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if Christ's body were to remain under this  sacrament 
even until the morrow, for the same reason it will remain there during 
all coming time; for it cannot be said that it ceases to be there when 
the species pass, because the existence of Christ's body is not dependent 
on those species. Yet Christ does not remain in this sacrament for all 
coming time. It seems, then, that straightway on the morrow, or after a 
short time, He ceases to be under this sacrament. And so it seems that 
Christ is in this sacrament movably.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> it is impossible for the same thing to be in motion and 
at rest, else contradictories would be verified of the same subject. But 
Christ's body is at rest in heaven. Therefore it is not movably in this 
sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[6] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> When any thing is one, as to subject, and manifold in 
being, there is nothing to hinder it from being moved in one respect, and 
yet to remain at rest in another just as it is one thing for a body to be 
white, and another thing, to be large; hence it can be moved as to its 
whiteness, and yet continue unmoved as to its magnitude. But in Christ, 
being in Himself and being under the sacrament are not the same thing, 
because when we say that He is under this sacrament, we express a kind of 
relationship to this sacrament. According to this being, then, Christ is 
not moved locally of Himself, but only accidentally, because Christ is 
not in this sacrament as in a place, as stated above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). But what is 
not in a place, is not moved of itself locally, but only according to the 
motion of the subject in which it is.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[6] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same way neither is it moved of itself according to the being 
which it has in this sacrament, by any other change whatever, as for 
instance, that it ceases to be under this sacrament: because whatever 
possesses unfailing existence of itself, cannot be the principle of 
failing; but when something else fails, then it ceases to be in it; just 
as God, Whose existence is unfailing and immortal, ceases to be in some 
corruptible creature because such corruptible creature ceases to exist. 
And in this way, since Christ has unfailing and incorruptible being, He 
ceases to be under this sacrament, not because He ceases to be, nor yet 
by local movement of His own, as is clear from what has been said, but 
only by the fact that the sacramental species cease to exist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[6] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence it is clear that Christ, strictly speaking is immovably in this 
sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument deals with accidental movement, whereby 
things within us are moved together with us. But with things which can of 
themselves be in a place, like bodies, it is otherwise than with things 
which cannot of themselves be in a place, such as forms and spiritual 
substances. And to this mode can be reduced what we say of Christ, being 
moved accidentally, according to the existence which He has in this 
sacrament, in which He is not present as in a place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It was this argument which seems to have  convinced those 
who held that Christ's body does not remain under this sacrament if it be 
reserved until the morrow. It is against these that Cyril says (Ep. 
lxxxiii): "Some are so foolish as to say that the mystical blessing 
departs from the sacrament, if any of its fragments remain until the next 
day: for Christ's consecrated body is not changed, and the power of the 
blessing, and the life-giving grace is perpetually in it." Thus are all 
other consecrations irremovable so long as the consecrated things endure; 
on which account they are not repeated. And although the truth 
corresponds with the figure, still the figure cannot equal it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The body of Christ remains in this sacrament not only until 
the morrow, but also in the future, so long as the sacramental species 
remain: and when they cease, Christ's body ceases to be under them, not 
because it depends on them, but because the relationship of Christ's body 
to those species is taken away, in the same way as God ceases to be the 
Lord of a creature which ceases to exist.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the body of Christ, as it is in this sacrament, can 
be seen by the eye, at least by a glorified one. For our eyes are 
hindered from beholding Christ's body in this sacrament, on account of 
the sacramental species veiling it. But the glorified eye cannot be 
hindered by anything from seeing bodies as they are. Therefore, the 
glorified eye can see Christ's body as it is in this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the glorified bodies of the saints will be "made like to 
the body" of Christ's "glory," according to Phil. 3:21. But Christ's eye 
beholds Himself as He is in this sacrament. Therefore, for the same 
reason, every other glorified eye can see Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the resurrection the saints will be equal to the 
angels, according to Lk. 20:36. But the angels see the body of Christ as 
it is in this sacrament, for even the devils are found to pay reverence 
thereto, and to fear it. Therefore, for like reason, the glorified eye 
can see Christ as He is in this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> As long as a thing remains the same, it cannot at the 
same time be seen by the same eye under diverse species. But the 
glorified eye sees Christ always, as He is in His own species, according 
to Is. 33:17: "(His eyes) shall see the king in his beauty." It seems, 
then, that it does not see Christ, as He is under the species of this 
sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[7] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The eye is of two kinds, namely, the bodily eye properly 
so-called, and the intellectual eye, so-called by similitude. But 
Christ's body as it is in this sacrament cannot be  seen by any bodily 
eye. First of all, because a body which is visible brings about an 
alteration in the medium, through its accidents. Now the accidents of 
Christ's body are in this sacrament by means of the substance; so that 
the accidents of Christ's body have no immediate relationship either to 
this sacrament or to adjacent bodies; consequently they do not act on the 
medium so as to be seen by any corporeal eye. Secondly, because, as 
stated above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A1A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), Christ's body is substantially present 
in this sacrament. But substance, as such, is not visible to the bodily 
eye, nor does it come under any one of the senses, nor under the 
imagination, but solely under the intellect, whose object is "what a 
thing is" (De Anima iii). And therefore, properly speaking, Christ's 
body, according to the mode of being which it has in this sacrament, is 
perceptible neither by the sense nor by the imagination, but only by the 
intellect, which is called the spiritual eye.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[7] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover it is perceived differently by different intellects. For since 
the way in which Christ is in this sacrament is entirely supernatural, it 
is visible in itself to a supernatural, i.e. the Divine, intellect, and 
consequently to a beatified intellect, of angel or of man, which, through 
the participated glory of the Divine intellect, sees all supernatural 
things in the vision of the Divine Essence. But it can be seen by a 
wayfarer through faith alone, like other supernatural things. And not 
even the angelic intellect of its own natural power is capable of 
beholding it; consequently the devils cannot by their intellect perceive 
Christ in this sacrament, except through faith, to which they do not pay 
willing assent; yet they are convinced of it from the evidence of signs, 
according to James 2:19: "The devils believe, and tremble."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Our bodily eye, on account of the sacramental species, is 
hindered from beholding the body of Christ underlying them, not merely as 
by way of veil (just as we are hindered from seeing what is covered with 
any corporeal veil), but also because Christ's body bears a relation to 
the medium surrounding this sacrament, not through its own accidents, but 
through the sacramental species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ's own bodily eye sees Himself existing under the 
sacrament, yet it cannot see the way in which it exists under the 
sacrament, because that belongs to the intellect. But it is not the same 
with any other glorified eye, because Christ's eye is under this 
sacrament, in which no other glorified eye is conformed to it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> No angel, good or bad, can see anything with a bodily eye, 
but only with the mental eye. Hence there is no parallel reason, as is 
evident from what was said above.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Christ's body is not truly there when  flesh or a 
child appears miraculously in this sacrament. Because His body ceases to 
be under this sacrament when the sacramental species cease to be present, 
as stated above (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). But when flesh or a child appears, the 
sacramental species cease to be present. Therefore Christ's body is not 
truly there.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, wherever Christ's body is, it is there either under its 
own species, or under those of the sacrament. But when such apparitions 
occur, it is evident that Christ is not present under His own species, 
because the entire Christ is contained in this sacrament, and He remains 
entire under the form in which He ascended to heaven: yet what appears 
miraculously in this sacrament is sometimes seen as a small particle of 
flesh, or at times as a small child. Now it is evident that He is not 
there under the sacramental species, which is that of bread or wine. 
Consequently, it seems that Christ's body is not there in any way.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ's body begins to be in this sacrament by 
consecration and conversion, as was said above (<A Href="TP075.html#TPQ75OUTP1">Question [75]</a>, <A Href="TP075.html#TPQ75ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3,4). But 
the flesh and blood which appear by miracle are not consecrated, nor are 
they converted into Christ's true body and blood. Therefore the body or 
the blood of Christ is not under those species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> When such apparition takes place, the same reverence is 
shown to it as was shown at first, which would not be done if Christ were 
not truly there, to Whom we show reverence of "latria." Therefore, when 
such apparition occurs, Christ is under the sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[8] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Such apparition comes about in two ways, when 
occasionally in this sacrament flesh, or blood, or a child, is seen. 
Sometimes it happens on the part of the beholders, whose eyes are so 
affected as if they outwardly saw flesh, or blood, or a child, while no 
change takes place in the sacrament. And this seems to happen when to one 
person it is seen under the species of flesh or of a child, while to 
others it is seen as before under the species of bread; or when to the 
same individual it appears for an hour under the appearance of flesh or a 
child, and afterwards under the appearance of bread. Nor is there any 
deception there, as occurs in the feats of magicians, because such 
species is divinely formed in the eye in order to represent some truth, 
namely, for the purpose of showing that Christ's body is truly under this 
sacrament; just as Christ without deception appeared to the disciples who 
were going to Emmaus. For Augustine says (De Qq. Evang. ii) that "when 
our pretense is referred to some significance, it is not a lie, but a 
figure of the truth." And since in this way no change is made in the 
sacrament, it is manifest that, when such apparition occurs, Christ does 
not cease to be under this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[8] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But it sometimes happens that such apparition comes about not merely by 
a change wrought in the beholders, but by an appearance which really 
exists outwardly. And this indeed is seen to happen  when it is beheld by 
everyone under such an appearance, and it remains so not for an hour, but 
for a considerable time; and, in this case some think that it is the 
proper species of Christ's body. Nor does it matter that sometimes 
Christ's entire body is not seen there, but part of His flesh, or else 
that it is not seen in youthful guise. but in the semblance of a child, 
because it lies within the power of a glorified body for it to be seen by 
a non-glorified eye either entirely or in part, and under its own 
semblance or in strange guise, as will be said later (<A Href="../XP.html">XP</a>, <A Href="../XP/XP085.html#XPQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="../XP/XP085.html#XPQ85ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[8] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this seems unlikely. First of all, because Christ's body under its 
proper species can be seen only in one place, wherein it is definitively 
contained. Hence since it is seen in its proper species, and is adored in 
heaven, it is not seen under its proper species in this sacrament. 
Secondly, because a glorified body, which appears at will, disappears 
when it wills after the apparition; thus it is related (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++24:31">Lk. 24:31</a>) that 
our Lord "vanished out of sight" of the disciples. But that which appears 
under the likeness of flesh in this sacrament, continues for a long time; 
indeed, one reads of its being sometimes enclosed, and, by order of many 
bishops, preserved in a pyx, which it would be wicked to think of Christ 
under His proper semblance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[8] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, it remains to be said, that, while the dimensions remain 
the same as before, there is a miraculous change wrought in the other 
accidents, such as shape, color, and the rest, so that flesh, or blood, 
or a child, is seen. And, as was said already, this is not deception, 
because it is done "to represent the truth," namely, to show by this 
miraculous apparition that Christ's body and blood are truly in this 
sacrament. And thus it is clear that as the dimensions remain, which are 
the foundation of the other accidents, as we shall see later on (<A Href="TP077.html#TPQ77OUTP1">Question [77]</a>, <A Href="TP077.html#TPQ77A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the body of Christ truly remains in this sacrament.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When such apparition takes place, the sacramental species 
sometimes continue entire in themselves; and sometimes only as to that 
which is principal, as was said above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above, during such apparitions Christ's proper 
semblance is not seen, but a species miraculously formed either in the 
eyes of the beholders, or in the sacramental dimensions themselves, as 
was said above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[76] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The dimensions of the consecrated bread and wine continue, 
while a miraculous change is wrought in the other accidents, as stated 
above.<br>
