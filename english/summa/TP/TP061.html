<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sacraments are not necessary for man's salvation. 
For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++4:8">1 Tim. 4:8</a>): "Bodily exercise is profitable to 
little." But the use of sacraments pertains to bodily exercise; because 
sacraments are perfected in the signification of sensible things and 
words, as stated above (<A Href="TP060.html#TPQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>, <A Href="TP060.html#TPQ60A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Therefore sacraments are not 
necessary for the salvation of man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle was told (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++12:9">2 Cor. 12:9</a>): "My grace is 
sufficient for thee." But it would not suffice if sacraments were 
necessary for salvation. Therefore sacraments are not necessary for man's 
salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, given a sufficient cause, nothing more seems to be 
required for the effect. But Christ's Passion is the sufficient cause of 
our salvation; for the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5:10">Rm. 5:10</a>): "If, when we were 
enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son: much more, 
being reconciled, shall we be saved by His life." Therefore sacraments 
are not necessary for man's salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix): "It is impossible 
to keep men together in one religious denomination, whether true or 
false, except they be united by means of visible signs or sacraments." 
But it is necessary for salvation that men be united together in the name 
of the one true religion. Therefore sacraments are necessary for man's 
salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[1] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sacraments are necessary unto man's salvation for three 
reasons. The first is taken from the condition of human nature which is 
such that it has to be led by things corporeal and sensible to things 
spiritual and intelligible. Now it belongs to Divine providence to 
provide for each one according as its condition requires. Divine wisdom, 
therefore, fittingly provides man with means of salvation, in the shape 
of corporeal and sensible signs that are called sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[1] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason is taken from the state of man who in sinning 
subjected himself by his affections to corporeal things. Now the healing 
remedy should be given to a man so as to reach the part affected by 
disease. Consequently it was fitting that God should provide man with a 
spiritual medicine by means of certain corporeal signs; for if man were 
offered spiritual things without a veil, his mind being taken up with the 
material world would be unable to apply itself to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[1] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The third reason is taken from the fact that man is prone to direct his 
activity chiefly towards material things. Lest, therefore, it should be 
too hard for man to be drawn away entirely from bodily actions, bodily 
exercise was offered to him in the sacraments, by which he might be 
trained to avoid superstitious practices, consisting in the worship of 
demons, and all manner of harmful action, consisting in sinful deeds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[1] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows, therefore, that through the institution of the  sacraments 
man, consistently with his nature, is instructed through sensible things; 
he is humbled, through confessing that he is subject to corporeal things, 
seeing that he receives assistance through them: and he is even preserved 
from bodily hurt, by the healthy exercise of the sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Bodily exercise, as such, is not very profitable: but 
exercise taken in the use of the sacraments is not merely bodily, but to 
a certain extent spiritual, viz. in its signification and in its 
causality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God's grace is a sufficient cause of man's salvation. But 
God gives grace to man in a way which is suitable to him. Hence it is 
that man needs the sacraments that he may obtain grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ's Passion is a sufficient cause of man's salvation. 
But it does not follow that the sacraments are not also necessary for 
that purpose: because they obtain their effect through the power of 
Christ's Passion; and Christ's Passion is, so to say, applied to man 
through the sacraments according to the Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++6:3">Rm. 6:3</a>): "All we who 
are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in His death."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that before sin sacraments were necessary to man. For, 
as stated above (<A Href="TP061.html#TPQ61A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2) man needs sacraments that he may obtain 
grace. But man needed grace even in the state of innocence, as we stated 
in the FP, Question [95], Article [4] (cf. FS, <A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/TP/TP109.html#TPQ109OUTP1">Question [109]</a>, <A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/TP/TP109.html#TPQ109A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114OUTP1">Question [114]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). 
Therefore sacraments were necessary in that state also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sacraments are suitable to man by reason of the 
conditions of human nature, as stated above (<A Href="TP061.html#TPQ61A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But man's nature is 
the same before and after sin. Therefore it seems that before sin, man 
needed the sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, matrimony is a sacrament, according to Eph. 5:32: "This 
is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the Church." But 
matrimony was instituted before sin, as may be seen in Gn. 2. Therefore 
sacraments were necessary to man before sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> None but the sick need remedies, according to Mt. 9:12: 
"They that are in health need not a physician." Now the sacraments are 
spiritual remedies for the healing of wounds inflicted by sin. Therefore 
they were not necessary before sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sacraments were not necessary in the state of innocence. 
This can be proved from the rectitude of that state, in which the higher 
(parts of man) ruled the lower, and nowise depended on them: for just as 
the mind was subject to God, so were the lower powers of the soul subject 
to the mind, and the body to the soul. And it would be contrary to this 
order if the soul were  perfected either in knowledge or in grace, by 
anything corporeal; which happens in the sacraments. Therefore in the 
state of innocence man needed no sacraments, whether as remedies against 
sin or as means of perfecting the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the state of innocence man needed grace: not so that he 
needed to obtain grace by means of sensible signs, but in a spiritual and 
invisible manner.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man's nature is the same before and after sin, but the 
state of his nature is not the same. Because after sin, the soul, even in 
its higher part, needs to receive something from corporeal things in 
order that it may be perfected: whereas man had no need of this in that 
state.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Matrimony was instituted in the state of innocence, not as 
a sacrament, but as a function of nature. Consequently, however, it 
foreshadowed something in relation to Christ and the Church: just as 
everything else foreshadowed Christ.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether there should have been sacraments after sin, before Christ?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that there should have been no sacraments after sin, 
before Christ. For it has been stated that the Passion of Christ is 
applied to men through the sacraments: so that Christ's Passion is 
compared to the sacraments as cause to effect. But effect does not 
precede cause. Therefore there should have been no sacraments before 
Christ's coming.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sacraments should be suitable to the state of the human 
race, as Augustine declares (Contra Faust. xix). But the state of the 
human race underwent no change after sin until it was repaired by Christ. 
Neither, therefore, should the sacraments have been changed, so that 
besides the sacraments of the natural law, others should be instituted in 
the law of Moses.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the nearer a thing approaches to that which is perfect, 
the more like it should it be. Now the perfection of human salvation was 
accomplished by Christ; to Whom the sacraments of the Old Law were nearer 
than those that preceded the Law. Therefore they should have borne a 
greater likeness to the sacraments of Christ. And yet the contrary is the 
case, since it was foretold that the priesthood of Christ would be 
"according to the order of Melchisedech, and not . . . according to the 
order of Aaron" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++7:11">Heb. 7:11</a>). Therefore sacraments were unsuitably 
instituted before Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix) that "the first 
sacraments which the Law commanded to be solemnized and observed were 
announcements of Christ's future coming." But it was necessary for man's 
salvation that Christ's coming should be announced beforehand. Therefore 
it was necessary that some sacraments should be instituted before Christ. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sacraments are necessary for man's salvation, in so far 
as they are sensible signs of invisible things whereby man is made holy. 
Now after sin no man can be made holy save through Christ, "Whom God hath 
proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in His blood, to the showing 
of His justice . . . that He Himself may be just, and the justifier of 
him who is of the faith of Jesus Christ" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++3:25,26">Rm. 3:25,26</a>). Therefore before 
Christ's coming there was need for some visible signs whereby man might 
testify to his faith in the future coming of a Saviour. And these signs 
are called sacraments. It is therefore clear that some sacraments were 
necessary before Christ's coming.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ's Passion is the final cause of the old sacraments: 
for they were instituted in order to foreshadow it. Now the final cause 
precedes not in time, but in the intention of the agent. Consequently, 
there is no reason against the existence of sacraments before Christ's 
Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The state of the human race after sin and before Christ can 
be considered from two points of view. First, from that of faith: and 
thus it was always one and the same: since men were made righteous, 
through faith in the future coming of Christ. Secondly, according as sin 
was more or less intense, and knowledge concerning Christ more or less 
explicit. For as time went on sin gained a greater hold on man, so much 
so that it clouded man's reason, the consequence being that the precepts 
of the natural law were insufficient to make man live aright, and it 
became necessary to have a written code of fixed laws, and together with 
these certain sacraments of faith. For it was necessary, as time went on, 
that the knowledge of faith should be more and more unfolded, since, as 
Gregory says (Hom. vi in Ezech.): "With the advance of time there was an 
advance in the knowledge of Divine things." Consequently in the old Law 
there was also a need for certain fixed sacraments significative of man's 
faith in the future coming of Christ: which sacraments are compared to 
those that preceded the Law, as something determinate to that which is 
indeterminate: inasmuch as before the Law it was not laid down precisely 
of what sacraments men were to make use: whereas this was prescribed by 
the Law; and this was necessary both on account of the overclouding of 
the natural law, and for the clearer signification of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sacrament of Melchisedech which preceded the Law is 
more like the Sacrament of the New Law in its matter: in so far as "he 
offered bread and wine" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++14:18">Gn. 14:18</a>), just as bread and wine are offered 
in the sacrifice of the New Testament. Nevertheless the sacraments of the 
Mosaic Law are more like the thing signified by the sacrament, i.e. the 
Passion of Christ: as clearly appears in the Paschal Lamb and such like. 
The reason of this was lest, if the sacraments retained the same 
appearance, it might seem to be the continuation of one and the same 
sacrament, where there was no interruption of time.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether there was need for any sacraments after Christ came?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that there was no need for any sacraments after Christ 
came. For the figure should cease with the advent of the truth. But 
"grace and truth came by Jesus Christ" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++1:17">Jn. 1:17</a>). Since, therefore, the 
sacraments are signs or figures of the truth, it seems that there was no 
need for any sacraments after Christ's Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sacraments consist in certain elements, as stated 
above (<A Href="TP060.html#TPQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>, <A Href="TP060.html#TPQ60A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++4:3,4">Gal. 4:3,4</a>) that "when we were 
children we were serving under the elements of the world": but that now 
"when the fulness of time" has "come," we are no longer children. 
Therefore it seems that we should not serve God under the elements of 
this world, by making use of corporeal sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to James 1:17 with God "there is no change, 
nor shadow of alteration." But it seems to argue some change in the 
Divine will that God should give man certain sacraments for his 
sanctification now during the time of grace, and other sacraments before 
Christ's coming. Therefore it seems that other sacraments should not have 
been instituted after Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix) that the sacraments 
of the Old Law "were abolished because they were fulfilled; and others 
were instituted, fewer in number, but more efficacious, more profitable, 
and of easier accomplishment."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the ancient Fathers were saved through faith in 
Christ's future coming, so are we saved through faith in Christ's past 
birth and Passion. Now the sacraments are signs in protestation of the 
faith whereby man is justified; and signs should vary according as they 
signify the future, the past, or the present; for as Augustine says 
(Contra Faust. xix), "the same thing is variously pronounced as to be 
done and as having been done: for instance the word 'passurus' [going to 
suffer] differs from 'passus' [having suffered]." Therefore the 
sacraments of the New Law, that signify Christ in relation to the past, 
must needs differ from those of the Old Law, that foreshadowed the future.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. v), the state of the New 
Law. is between the state of the Old Law, whose figures are fulfilled in 
the New, and the state of glory, in which all truth will be openly and 
perfectly revealed. Wherefore then there will be no sacraments. But now, 
so long as we know "through a glass in a dark manner," (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13:12">1 Cor. 13:12</a>) we 
need sensible signs in order to reach spiritual things: and this is the 
province of the sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Apostle calls the sacraments of the Old Law "weak and 
needy elements" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++4:9">Gal. 4:9</a>) because they neither contained nor caused 
grace. Hence the Apostle says that those who used these sacraments served 
God "under the elements of this world": for the very reason that these 
sacraments were nothing else than the  elements of this world. But our 
sacraments both contain and cause grace: consequently the comparison does 
not hold.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[61] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as the head of the house is not proved to have a 
changeable mind, through issuing various commands to his household at 
various seasons, ordering things differently in winter and summer; so it 
does not follow that there is any change in God, because He instituted
