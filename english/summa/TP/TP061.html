    Whether sacraments are necessary for man's salvation?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that sacraments are not necessary for
    man's salvation. For the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++4%3A8"
      >1 Tim. 4:8</a
    >): "Bodily exercise is profitable to little." But the use of sacraments
    pertains to bodily exercise; because sacraments are perfected in the
    signification of sensible things and words, as stated above (<a
      href="TP060.html#TPQ60OUTP1"
      >Question [60]</a
    >, <a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Therefore sacraments
    are not necessary for the salvation of man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle was told (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++12%3A9"
      >2 Cor. 12:9</a
    >): "My grace is sufficient for thee." But it would not suffice if
    sacraments were necessary for salvation. Therefore sacraments are not
    necessary for man's salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, given a sufficient cause, nothing more
    seems to be required for the effect. But Christ's Passion is the sufficient
    cause of our salvation; for the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A10"
      >Rm. 5:10</a
    >): "If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His
    Son: much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by His life." Therefore
    sacraments are not necessary for man's salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix): "It is
    impossible to keep men together in one religious denomination, whether true
    or false, except they be united by means of visible signs or sacraments."
    But it is necessary for salvation that men be united together in the name of
    the one true religion. Therefore sacraments are necessary for man's
    salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Sacraments are necessary unto man's salvation
    for three reasons. The first is taken from the condition of human nature
    which is such that it has to be led by things corporeal and sensible to
    things spiritual and intelligible. Now it belongs to Divine providence to
    provide for each one according as its condition requires. Divine wisdom,
    therefore, fittingly provides man with means of salvation, in the shape of
    corporeal and sensible signs that are called sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The second reason is taken from the state of man who in sinning subjected
    himself by his affections to corporeal things. Now the healing remedy should
    be given to a man so as to reach the part affected by disease. Consequently
    it was fitting that God should provide man with a spiritual medicine by
    means of certain corporeal signs; for if man were offered spiritual things
    without a veil, his mind being taken up with the material world would be
    unable to apply itself to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The third reason is taken from the fact that man is prone to direct his
    activity chiefly towards material things. Lest, therefore, it should be too
    hard for man to be drawn away entirely from bodily actions, bodily exercise
    was offered to him in the sacraments, by which he might be trained to avoid
    superstitious practices, consisting in the worship of demons, and all manner
    of harmful action, consisting in sinful deeds.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It follows, therefore, that through the institution of the sacraments man,
    consistently with his nature, is instructed through sensible things; he is
    humbled, through confessing that he is subject to corporeal things, seeing
    that he receives assistance through them: and he is even preserved from
    bodily hurt, by the healthy exercise of the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Bodily exercise, as such, is not very
    profitable: but exercise taken in the use of the sacraments is not merely
    bodily, but to a certain extent spiritual, viz. in its signification and in
    its causality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God's grace is a sufficient cause of
    man's salvation. But God gives grace to man in a way which is suitable to
    him. Hence it is that man needs the sacraments that he may obtain grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ's Passion is a sufficient cause
    of man's salvation. But it does not follow that the sacraments are not also
    necessary for that purpose: because they obtain their effect through the
    power of Christ's Passion; and Christ's Passion is, so to say, applied to
    man through the sacraments according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++6%3A3"
      >Rm. 6:3</a
    >): "All we who are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in His death."<br />

    Whether before sin sacraments were necessary to man?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that before sin sacraments were
    necessary to man. For, as stated above (<a href="TP061.html#TPQ61A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 2) man needs sacraments that he may obtain grace. But man needed grace
    even in the state of innocence, as we stated in the FP, Question [95],
    Article [4] (cf. FS,
    <a href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/summa/TP/TP109.html#TPQ109OUTP1"
      >Question [109]</a
    >,
    <a
      href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/summa/TP/TP109.html#TPQ109A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >; <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114OUTP1">Question [114]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore
    sacraments were necessary in that state also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sacraments are suitable to man by reason
    of the conditions of human nature, as stated above (<a
      href="TP061.html#TPQ61A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). But man's nature is the same before and after sin. Therefore it seems
    that before sin, man needed the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, matrimony is a sacrament, according to
    Eph. 5:32: "This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the
    Church." But matrimony was instituted before sin, as may be seen in Gn. 2.
    Therefore sacraments were necessary to man before sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> None but the sick need remedies, according to
    Mt. 9:12: "They that are in health need not a physician." Now the sacraments
    are spiritual remedies for the healing of wounds inflicted by sin. Therefore
    they were not necessary before sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Sacraments were not necessary in the state of
    innocence. This can be proved from the rectitude of that state, in which the
    higher (parts of man) ruled the lower, and nowise depended on them: for just
    as the mind was subject to God, so were the lower powers of the soul subject
    to the mind, and the body to the soul. And it would be contrary to this
    order if the soul were perfected either in knowledge or in grace, by
    anything corporeal; which happens in the sacraments. Therefore in the state
    of innocence man needed no sacraments, whether as remedies against sin or as
    means of perfecting the soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the state of innocence man needed
    grace: not so that he needed to obtain grace by means of sensible signs, but
    in a spiritual and invisible manner.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man's nature is the same before and
    after sin, but the state of his nature is not the same. Because after sin,
    the soul, even in its higher part, needs to receive something from corporeal
    things in order that it may be perfected: whereas man had no need of this in
    that state.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Matrimony was instituted in the state of
    innocence, not as a sacrament, but as a function of nature. Consequently,
    however, it foreshadowed something in relation to Christ and the Church:
    just as everything else foreshadowed Christ.<br />

    Whether there should have been sacraments after sin, before Christ?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that there should have been no
    sacraments after sin, before Christ. For it has been stated that the Passion
    of Christ is applied to men through the sacraments: so that Christ's Passion
    is compared to the sacraments as cause to effect. But effect does not
    precede cause. Therefore there should have been no sacraments before
    Christ's coming.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sacraments should be suitable to the
    state of the human race, as Augustine declares (Contra Faust. xix). But the
    state of the human race underwent no change after sin until it was repaired
    by Christ. Neither, therefore, should the sacraments have been changed, so
    that besides the sacraments of the natural law, others should be instituted
    in the law of Moses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the nearer a thing approaches to that
    which is perfect, the more like it should it be. Now the perfection of human
    salvation was accomplished by Christ; to Whom the sacraments of the Old Law
    were nearer than those that preceded the Law. Therefore they should have
    borne a greater likeness to the sacraments of Christ. And yet the contrary
    is the case, since it was foretold that the priesthood of Christ would be
    "according to the order of Melchisedech, and not... according to the order
    of Aaron" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++7%3A11"
      >Heb. 7:11</a
    >). Therefore sacraments were unsuitably instituted before Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix) that "the
    first sacraments which the Law commanded to be solemnized and observed were
    announcements of Christ's future coming." But it was necessary for man's
    salvation that Christ's coming should be announced beforehand. Therefore it
    was necessary that some sacraments should be instituted before Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Sacraments are necessary for man's salvation,
    in so far as they are sensible signs of invisible things whereby man is made
    holy. Now after sin no man can be made holy save through Christ, "Whom God
    hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in His blood, to the
    showing of His justice... that He Himself may be just, and the justifier of
    him who is of the faith of Jesus Christ" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++3%3A25,26"
      >Rm. 3:25,26</a
    >). Therefore before Christ's coming there was need for some visible signs
    whereby man might testify to his faith in the future coming of a Saviour.
    And these signs are called sacraments. It is therefore clear that some
    sacraments were necessary before Christ's coming.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ's Passion is the final cause of
    the old sacraments: for they were instituted in order to foreshadow it. Now
    the final cause precedes not in time, but in the intention of the agent.
    Consequently, there is no reason against the existence of sacraments before
    Christ's Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The state of the human race after sin
    and before Christ can be considered from two points of view. First, from
    that of faith: and thus it was always one and the same: since men were made
    righteous, through faith in the future coming of Christ. Secondly, according
    as sin was more or less intense, and knowledge concerning Christ more or
    less explicit. For as time went on sin gained a greater hold on man, so much
    so that it clouded man's reason, the consequence being that the precepts of
    the natural law were insufficient to make man live aright, and it became
    necessary to have a written code of fixed laws, and together with these
    certain sacraments of faith. For it was necessary, as time went on, that the
    knowledge of faith should be more and more unfolded, since, as Gregory says
    (Hom. vi in Ezech.): "With the advance of time there was an advance in the
    knowledge of Divine things." Consequently in the old Law there was also a
    need for certain fixed sacraments significative of man's faith in the future
    coming of Christ: which sacraments are compared to those that preceded the
    Law, as something determinate to that which is indeterminate: inasmuch as
    before the Law it was not laid down precisely of what sacraments men were to
    make use: whereas this was prescribed by the Law; and this was necessary
    both on account of the overclouding of the natural law, and for the clearer
    signification of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sacrament of Melchisedech which
    preceded the Law is more like the Sacrament of the New Law in its matter: in
    so far as "he offered bread and wine" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++14%3A18"
      >Gn. 14:18</a
    >), just as bread and wine are offered in the sacrifice of the New
    Testament. Nevertheless the sacraments of the Mosaic Law are more like the
    thing signified by the sacrament, i.e. the Passion of Christ: as clearly
    appears in the Paschal Lamb and such like. The reason of this was lest, if
    the sacraments retained the same appearance, it might seem to be the
    continuation of one and the same sacrament, where there was no interruption
    of time.<br />

    Whether there was need for any sacraments after Christ came?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that there was no need for any
    sacraments after Christ came. For the figure should cease with the advent of
    the truth. But "grace and truth came by Jesus Christ" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A17"
      >Jn. 1:17</a
    >). Since, therefore, the sacraments are signs or figures of the truth, it
    seems that there was no need for any sacraments after Christ's Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sacraments consist in certain
    elements, as stated above (<a href="TP060.html#TPQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a
    >, <a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But the Apostle says
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++4%3A3,4">Gal. 4:3,4</a
    >) that "when we were children we were serving under the elements of the
    world": but that now "when the fulness of time" has "come," we are no longer
    children. Therefore it seems that we should not serve God under the elements
    of this world, by making use of corporeal sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to James 1:17 with God "there
    is no change, nor shadow of alteration." But it seems to argue some change
    in the Divine will that God should give man certain sacraments for his
    sanctification now during the time of grace, and other sacraments before
    Christ's coming. Therefore it seems that other sacraments should not have
    been instituted after Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix) that the
    sacraments of the Old Law "were abolished because they were fulfilled; and
    others were instituted, fewer in number, but more efficacious, more
    profitable, and of easier accomplishment."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the ancient Fathers were saved through faith
    in Christ's future coming, so are we saved through faith in Christ's past
    birth and Passion. Now the sacraments are signs in protestation of the faith
    whereby man is justified; and signs should vary according as they signify
    the future, the past, or the present; for as Augustine says (Contra Faust.
    xix), "the same thing is variously pronounced as to be done and as having
    been done: for instance the word 'passurus' [going to suffer] differs from
    'passus' [having suffered]." Therefore the sacraments of the New Law, that
    signify Christ in relation to the past, must needs differ from those of the
    Old Law, that foreshadowed the future.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. v), the
    state of the New Law. is between the state of the Old Law, whose figures are
    fulfilled in the New, and the state of glory, in which all truth will be
    openly and perfectly revealed. Wherefore then there will be no sacraments.
    But now, so long as we know "through a glass in a dark manner," (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++13%3A12"
      >1 Cor. 13:12</a
    >) we need sensible signs in order to reach spiritual things: and this is
    the province of the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Apostle calls the sacraments of the
    Old Law "weak and needy elements" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++4%3A9"
      >Gal. 4:9</a
    >) because they neither contained nor caused grace. Hence the Apostle says
    that those who used these sacraments served God "under the elements of this
    world": for the very reason that these sacraments were nothing else than the
