    <br />
    THE SACRAMENTS IN GENERAL (Questions [60]-65)<br />
    <br />
    WHAT IS A SACRAMENT? (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    After considering those things that concern the mystery of the incarnate
    Word, we must consider the sacraments of the Church which derive their
    efficacy from the Word incarnate Himself. First we shall consider the
    sacraments in general; secondly, we shall consider specially each
    sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Concerning the first our consideration will be fivefold: (1) What is a
    sacrament? (2) Of the necessity of the sacraments; (3) of the effects of the
    sacraments; (4) Of their cause; (5) Of their number.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first heading there are eight points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a sacrament is a kind of
    sign?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether every sign of a sacred
    thing is a sacrament?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether a sacrament is a sign of
    one thing only, or of several?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether a sacrament is a sign that
    is something sensible?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether some determinate sensible
    thing is required for a sacrament?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether signification expressed by
    words is necessary for a sacrament?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether determinate words are
    required?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether anything may be added to
    or subtracted from these words?

  <h3 align="left">Whether a sacrament is a kind of sign?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a sacrament is not a kind of sign.
    For sacrament appears to be derived from "sacring" [sacrando]; just as
    medicament, from "medicando" [healing]. But this seems to be of the nature
    of a cause rather than of a sign. Therefore a sacrament is a kind of cause
    rather than a kind of sign.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sacrament seems to signify something
    hidden, according to Tobias 12:7: "It is good to hide the secret
    [sacramentum] of a king"; and Eph. 3:9: "What is the dispensation of the
    mystery [sacramenti] which hath been hidden from eternity in God." But that
    which is hidden, seems foreign to the nature of a sign; for "a sign is that
    which conveys something else to the mind, besides the species which it
    impresses on the senses," as Augustine explains (De Doctr. Christ. ii).
    Therefore it seems that a sacrament is not a kind of sign.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, an oath is sometimes called a sacrament:
    for it is written in the Decretals (Caus. xxii, qu. 5): "Children who have
    not attained the use of reason must not be obliged to swear: and whoever has
    foresworn himself once, must no more be a witness, nor be allowed to take a
    sacrament," i.e. an oath. But an oath is not a kind of sign, therefore it
    seems that a sacrament is not a kind of sign.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x): "The visible
    sacrifice is the sacrament, i.e. the sacred sign, of the invisible
    sacrifice."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> All things that are ordained to one, even in
    different ways, can be denominated from it: thus, from health which is in an
    animal, not only is the animal said to be healthy through being the subject
    of health: but medicine also is said to be healthy through producing health;
    diet through preserving it; and urine, through being a sign of health.
    Consequently, a thing may be called a "sacrament," either from having a
    certain hidden sanctity, and in this sense a sacrament is a "sacred secret";
    or from having some relationship to this sanctity, which relationship may be
    that of a cause, or of a sign or of any other relation. But now we are
    speaking of sacraments in a special sense, as implying the habitude of sign:
    and in this way a sacrament is a kind of sign.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Because medicine is an efficient cause
    of health, consequently whatever things are denominated from medicine are to
    be referred to some first active cause: so that a medicament implies a
    certain causality. But sanctity from which a sacrament is denominated, is
    not there taken as an efficient cause, but rather as a formal or a final
    cause. Therefore it does not follow that a sacrament need always imply
    causality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument considers sacrament in the
    sense of a "sacred secret." Now not only God's but also the king's, secret,
    is said to be sacred and to be a sacrament: because according to the
    ancients, whatever it was unlawful to lay violent hands on was said to be
    holy or sacrosanct, such as the city walls, and persons of high rank.
    Consequently those secrets, whether Divine or human, which it is unlawful to
    violate by making them known to anybody whatever, are called "sacred secrets
    or sacraments."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even an oath has a certain relation to
    sacred things, in so far as it consists in calling a sacred thing to
    witness. And in this sense it is called a sacrament: not in the sense in
    which we speak of sacraments now; the word "sacrament" being thus used not
    equivocally but analogically, i.e. by reason of a different relation to the
    one thing, viz. something sacred.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether every sign of a holy thing is a sacrament?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that not every sign of a sacred thing is
    a sacrament. For all sensible creatures are signs of sacred things;
    according to Rm. 1:20: "The invisible things of God are clearly seen being
    understood by the things that are made." And yet all sensible things cannot
    be called sacraments. Therefore not every sign of a sacred thing is a
    sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever was done under the Old Law was
    a figure of Christ Who is the "Holy of Holies" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++9%3A24"
      >Dan. 9:24</a
    >), according to 1 Cor. 10:11: "All (these) things happened to them in
    figure"; and Col. 2:17: "Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body
    is Christ's." And yet not all that was done by the Fathers of the Old
    Testament, not even all the ceremonies of the Law, were sacraments, but only
    in certain special cases, as stated in the FS, Question [101], Article [4].
    Therefore it seems that not every sign of a sacred thing is a sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, even in the New Testament many things
    are done in sign of some sacred thing; yet they are not called sacraments;
    such as sprinkling with holy water, the consecration of an altar, and such
    like. Therefore not every sign of a sacred thing is a sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A definition is convertible with the thing
    defined. Now some define a sacrament as being "the sign of a sacred thing";
    moreover, this is clear from the passage quoted above (<a
      href="TP060.html#TPQ60A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >) from Augustine. Therefore it seems that every sign of a sacred thing is a
    sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Signs are given to men, to whom it is proper to
    discover the unknown by means of the known. Consequently a sacrament
    properly so called is that which is the sign of some sacred thing pertaining
    to man; so that properly speaking a sacrament, as considered by us now, is
    defined as being the "sign of a holy thing so far as it makes men holy."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sensible creatures signify something
    holy, viz. Divine wisdom and goodness inasmuch as these are holy in
    themselves; but not inasmuch as we are made holy by them. Therefore they
    cannot be called sacraments as we understand sacraments now.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Some things pertaining to the Old
    Testament signified the holiness of Christ considered as holy in Himself.
    Others signified His holiness considered as the cause of our holiness; thus
    the sacrifice of the Paschal Lamb signified Christ's Sacrifice whereby we
    are made holy: and such like are properly styled sacraments of the Old
    Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Names are given to things considered in
    reference to their end and state of completeness. Now a disposition is not
    an end, whereas perfection is. Consequently things that signify disposition
    to holiness are not called sacraments, and with regard to these the
    objection is verified: only those are called sacraments which signify the
    perfection of holiness in man.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether a sacrament is a sign of one thing only?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a sacrament is a sign of one thing
    only. For that which signifies many things is an ambiguous sign, and
    consequently occasions deception: this is clearly seen in equivocal words.
    But all deception should be removed from the Christian religion, according
    to Col. 2:8: "Beware lest any man cheat you by philosophy and vain deceit."
    Therefore it seems that a sacrament is not a sign of several things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<a
      href="TP060.html#TPQ60A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), a sacrament signifies a holy thing in so far as it makes man holy. But
    there is only one cause of man's holiness, viz. the blood of Christ;
    according to Heb. 13:12: "Jesus, that He might sanctify the people by His
    own blood, suffered without the gate." Therefore it seems that a sacrament
    does not signify several things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it has been said above (<a
      href="TP060.html#TPQ60A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, ad 3) that a sacrament signifies properly the very end of sanctification.
    Now the end of sanctification is eternal life, according to Rm. 6:22: "You
    have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life everlasting."
    Therefore it seems that the sacraments signify one thing only, viz. eternal
    life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> In the Sacrament of the Altar, two things are
    signified, viz. Christ's true body, and Christ's mystical body; as Augustine
    says (Liber Sent. Prosper.).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP060.html#TPQ60A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >) a sacrament properly speaking is that which is ordained to signify our
    sanctification. In which three things may be considered; viz. the very cause
    of our sanctification, which is Christ's passion; the form of our
    sanctification, which is grace and the virtues; and the ultimate end of our
    sanctification, which is eternal life. And all these are signified by the
    sacraments. Consequently a sacrament is a sign that is both a reminder of
    the past, i.e. the passion of Christ; and an indication of that which is
    effected in us by Christ's passion, i.e. grace; and a prognostic, that is, a
    foretelling of future glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Then is a sign ambiguous and the
    occasion of deception, when it signifies many things not ordained to one
    another. But when it signifies many things inasmuch as, through being
    mutually ordained, they form one thing, then the sign is not ambiguous but
    certain: thus this word "man" signifies the soul and body inasmuch as
    together they form the human nature. In this way a sacrament signifies the
    three things aforesaid, inasmuch as by being in a certain order they are one
    thing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since a sacrament signifies that which
    sanctifies, it must needs signify the effect, which is implied in the
    sanctifying cause as such.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is enough for a sacrament that it
    signify that perfection which consists in the form, nor is it necessary that
    it should signify only that perfection which is the end.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether a sacrament is always something sensible?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a sacrament is not always something
    sensible. Because, according to the Philosopher (Prior. Anal. ii), every
    effect is a sign of its cause. But just as there are some sensible effects,
    so are there some intelligible effects; thus science is the effect of a
    demonstration. Therefore not every sign is sensible. Now all that is
    required for a sacrament is something that is a sign of some sacred thing,
    inasmuch as thereby man is sanctified, as stated above (<a
      href="TP060.html#TPQ60A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). Therefore something sensible is not required for a sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sacraments belong to the kingdom of God
    and the Divine worship. But sensible things do not seem to belong to the
    Divine worship: for we are told (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++4%3A24"
      >Jn. 4:24</a
    >) that "God is a spirit; and they that adore Him, must adore Him in spirit
    and in truth"; and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++14%3A17"
      >Rm. 14:17</a
    >) that "the kingdom of God is not meat and drink." Therefore sensible
    things are not required for the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further. Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. ii) that
    "sensible things are goods of least account, since without them man can live
    aright." But the sacraments are necessary for man's salvation, as we shall
    show farther on (<a href="TP061.html#TPQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>,
    <a href="TP061.html#TPQ61A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>): so that man cannot live
    aright without them. Therefore sensible things are not required for the
    sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Tract. lxxx super Joan.):
    "The word is added to the element and this becomes a sacrament"; and he is
    speaking there of water which is a sensible element. Therefore sensible
    things are required for the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Divine wisdom provides for each thing according
    to its mode; hence it is written (Wis. 8:1) that "she... ordereth all things
    sweetly": wherefore also we are told (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++25%3A15"
      >Mt. 25:15</a
    >) that she "gave to everyone according to his proper ability." Now it is
    part of man's nature to acquire knowledge of the intelligible from the
    sensible. But a sign is that by means of which one attains to the knowledge
    of something else. Consequently, since the sacred things which are signified
    by the sacraments, are the spiritual and intelligible goods by means of
    which man is sanctified, it follows that the sacramental signs consist in
    sensible things: just as in the Divine Scriptures spiritual things are set
    before us under the guise of things sensible. And hence it is that sensible
    things are required for the sacraments; as Dionysius also proves in his book
    on the heavenly hierarchy (Coel. Hier. i).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The name and definition of a thing is
    taken principally from that which belongs to a thing primarily and
    essentially: and not from that which belongs to it through something else.
    Now a sensible effect being the primary and direct object of man's knowledge
    (since all our knowledge springs from the senses) by its very nature leads
    to the knowledge of something else: whereas intelligible effects are not
    such as to be able to lead us to the knowledge of something else, except in
    so far as they are manifested by some other thing, i.e. by certain
    sensibles. It is for this reason that the name sign is given primarily and
    principally to things which are offered to the senses; hence Augustine says
    (De Doctr. Christ. ii) that a sign "is that which conveys something else to
    the mind, besides the species which it impresses on the senses." But
    intelligible effects do not partake of the nature of a sign except in so far
    as they are pointed out by certain signs. And in this way, too, certain
    things which are not sensible are termed sacraments as it were, in so far as
    they are signified by certain sensible things, of which we shall treat
    further on (<a href="TP063.html#TPQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>,

  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sensible things considered in their own
    nature do not belong to the worship or kingdom of God: but considered only
    as signs of spiritual things in which the kingdom of God consists.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Augustine speaks there of sensible
    things, considered in their nature; but not as employed to signify spiritual
    things, which are the highest goods.<br />

    Whether determinate things are required for a sacrament?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that determinate things are not required
    for a sacrament. For sensible things are required in sacraments for the
    purpose of signification, as stated above (<a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >). But nothing hinders the same thing being signified by divers sensible
    things: thus in Holy Scripture God is signified metaphorically, sometimes by
    a stone (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Sam++22%3A2;+Zach++3:9;+1+Cor++10:4;+Apoc++4:3"
      >2 Kgs. 22:2; Zach. 3:9; 1 Cor. 10:4; Apoc. 4:3</a
    >); sometimes by a lion (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++31%3A4;+Apoc++5:5"
      >Is. 31:4; Apoc. 5:5</a
    >); sometimes by the sun (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++60%3A19,20;+Mal++4:2"
      >Is. 60:19,20; Mal. 4:2</a
    >), or by something similar. Therefore it seems that divers things can be
    suitable to the same sacrament. Therefore determinate things are not
    required for the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the health of the soul is more necessary
    than that of the body. But in bodily medicines, which are ordained to the
    health of the body, one thing can be substituted for another which happens
    to be wanting. Therefore much more in the sacraments, which are spiritual
    remedies ordained to the health of the soul, can one thing be substituted
    for another when this happens to be lacking.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is not fitting that the salvation of
    men be restricted by the Divine Law: still less by the Law of Christ, Who
    came to save all. But in the state of the Law of nature determinate things
    were not required in the sacraments, but were put to that use through a vow,
    as appears from Gn. 28, where Jacob vowed that he would offer to God tithes
    and peace-offerings. Therefore it seems that man should not have been
    restricted, especially under the New Law, to the use of any determinate
    thing in the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A5"
      >Jn. 3:5</a
    >): "Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter
    into the kingdom of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the use of the sacraments two things may be
    considered, namely, the worship of God, and the sanctification of man: the
    former of which pertains to man as referred to God, and the latter pertains
    to God in reference to man. Now it is not for anyone to determine that which
    is in the power of another, but only that which is in his own power. Since,
    therefore, the sanctification of man is in the power of God Who sanctifies,
    it is not for man to decide what things should be used for his
    sanctification, but this should be determined by Divine institution.
    Therefore in the sacraments of the New Law, by which man is sanctified
    according to 1 Cor. 6:11, "You are washed, you are sanctified," we must use
    those things which are determined by Divine institution.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Though the same thing can be signified
    by divers signs, yet to determine which sign must be used belongs to the
    signifier. Now it is God Who signifies spiritual things to us by means of
    the sensible things in the sacraments, and of similitudes in the Scriptures.
    And consequently, just as the Holy Ghost decides by what similitudes
    spiritual things are to be signified in certain passages of Scripture, so
    also must it be determined by Divine institution what things are to be
    employed for the purpose of signification in this or that sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sensible things are endowed with natural
    powers conducive to the health of the body: and therefore if two of them
    have the same virtue, it matters not which we use. Yet they are ordained
    unto sanctification not through any power that they possess naturally, but
    only in virtue of the Divine institution. And therefore it was necessary
    that God should determine the sensible things to be employed in the
    sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix),
    diverse sacraments suit different times; just as different times are
    signified by different parts of the verb, viz. present, past, and future.
    Consequently, just as under the state of the Law of nature man was moved by
    inward instinct and without any outward law, to worship God, so also the
    sensible things to be employed in the worship of God were determined by
    inward instinct. But later on it became necessary for a law to be given (to
    man) from without: both because the Law of nature had become obscured by
    man's sins; and in order to signify more expressly the grace of Christ, by
    which the human race is sanctified. And hence the need for those things to
    be determinate, of which men have to make use in the sacraments. Nor is the
    way of salvation narrowed thereby: because the things which need to be used
    in the sacraments, are either in everyone's possession or can be had with
    little trouble.

    Whether words are required for the signification of the sacraments?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that words are not required for the
    signification of the sacraments. For Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix):
    "What else is a corporeal sacrament but a kind of visible word?" Wherefore
    to add words to the sensible things in the sacraments seems to be the same
    as to add words to words. But this is superfluous. Therefore words are not
    required besides the sensible things in the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a sacrament is some one thing, but it
    does not seem possible to make one thing of those that belong to different
    genera. Since, therefore, sensible things and words are of different genera,
    for sensible things are the product of nature, but words, of reason; it
    seems that in the sacraments, words are not required besides sensible
    things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the sacraments of the New Law succeed
    those of the Old Law: since "the former were instituted when the latter were
    abolished," as Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix). But no form of words was
    required in the sacraments of the Old Law. Therefore neither is it required
    in those of the New Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A25,26"
      >Eph. 5:25,26</a
    >): "Christ loved the Church, and delivered Himself up for it; that He might
    sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life." And
    Augustine says (Tract. xxx in Joan.): "The word is added to the element, and
    this becomes a sacrament."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The sacraments, as stated above (<a
      href="TP060.html#TPQ60ATHEP1"
      >Articles [2]</a
    >,3), are employed as signs for man's sanctification. Consequently they can
    be considered in three ways: and in each way it is fitting for words to be
    added to the sensible signs. For in the first place they can be considered
    in regard to the cause of sanctification, which is the Word incarnate: to
    Whom the sacraments have a certain conformity, in that the word is joined to
    the sensible sign, just as in the mystery of the Incarnation the Word of God
    is united to sensible flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, sacraments may be considered on the part of man who is sanctified,
    and who is composed of soul and body: to whom the sacramental remedy is
    adjusted, since it touches the body through the sensible element, and the
    soul through faith in the words. Hence Augustine says (Tract. lxxx in Joan.)
    on Jn. 15:3, "Now you are clean by reason of the word," etc.: "Whence hath
    water this so great virtue, to touch the body and wash the heart, but by the
    word doing it, not because it is spoken, but because it is believed?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, a sacrament may be considered on the part of the sacramental
    signification. Now Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. ii) that "words are the
    principal signs used by men"; because words can be formed in various ways
    for the purpose of signifying various mental concepts, so that we are able
    to express our thoughts with greater distinctness by means of words. And
    therefore in order to insure the perfection of sacramental signification it
    was necessary to determine the signification of the sensible things by means
    of certain words. For water may signify both a cleansing by reason of its
    humidity, and refreshment by reason of its being cool: but when we say, "I
    baptize thee," it is clear that we use water in baptism in order to signify
    a spiritual cleansing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The sensible elements of the sacraments
    are called words by way of a certain likeness, in so far as they partake of
    a certain significative power, which resides principally in the very words,
    as stated above. Consequently it is not a superfluous repetition to add
    words to the visible element in the sacraments; because one determines the
    other, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although words and other sensible things
    are not in the same genus, considered in their natures, yet have they
    something in common as to the thing signified by them: which is more
    perfectly done in words than in other things. Wherefore in the sacraments,
    words and things, like form and matter, combine in the formation of one
    thing, in so far as the signification of things is completed by means of
    words, as above stated. And under words are comprised also sensible actions,
    such as cleansing and anointing and such like: because they have a like
    signification with the things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix),
    the sacraments of things present should be different from sacraments of
    things to come. Now the sacraments of the Old Law foretold the coming of
    Christ. Consequently they did not signify Christ so clearly as the
    sacraments of the New Law, which flow from Christ Himself, and have a
    certain likeness to Him, as stated above. Nevertheless in the Old Law,
    certain words were used in things pertaining to the worship of God, both by
    the priests, who were the ministers of those sacraments, according to Num.
    6:23,24: "Thus shall you bless the children of Israel, and you shall say to
    them: The Lord bless thee," etc.; and by those who made use of those
    sacraments, according to Dt. 26:3: "I profess this day before the Lord thy
    God," etc.<br />

    Whether determinate words are required in the sacraments?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that determinate words are not required
    in the sacraments. For as the Philosopher says (Peri Herm. i), "words are
    not the same for all." But salvation, which is sought through the
    sacraments, is the same for all. Therefore determinate words are not
    required in the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, words are required in the sacraments
    forasmuch as they are the principal means of signification, as stated above
    (<a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). But it happens that
    various words mean the same. Therefore determinate words are not required in
    the sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, corruption of anything changes its
    species. But some corrupt the pronunciation of words, and yet it is not
    credible that the sacramental effect is hindered thereby; else unlettered
    men and stammerers, in conferring sacraments, would frequently do so
    invalidly. Therefore it seems that determinate words are not required in the
    sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord used determinate words in
    consecrating the sacrament of the Eucharist, when He said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++26%3A26"
      >Mt. 26:26</a
    >): "This is My Body." Likewise He commanded His disciples to baptize under
    a form of determinate words, saying (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++28%3A19"
      >Mt. 28:19</a
    >): "Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
    and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP060.html#TPQ60A6THEP1"
      >Article [6]</a
    >, ad 2), in the sacraments the words are as the form, and sensible things
    are as the matter. Now in all things composed of matter and form, the
    determining principle is on the part of the form, which is as it were the
    end and terminus of the matter. Consequently for the being of a thing the
    need of a determinate form is prior to the need of determinate matter: for
    determinate matter is needed that it may be adapted to the determinate form.
    Since, therefore, in the sacraments determinate sensible things are
    required, which are as the sacramental matter, much more is there need in
    them of a determinate form of words.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (Tract. lxxx super
    Joan.), the word operates in the sacraments "not because it is spoken," i.e.
    not by the outward sound of the voice, "but because it is believed" in
    accordance with the sense of the words which is held by faith. And this
    sense is indeed the same for all, though the same words as to their sound be
    not used by all. Consequently no matter in what language this sense is
    expressed, the sacrament is complete.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although it happens in every language
    that various words signify the same thing, yet one of those words is that
    which those who speak that language use principally and more commonly to
    signify that particular thing: and this is the word which should be used for
    the sacramental signification. So also among sensible things, that one is
    used for the sacramental signification which is most commonly employed for
    the action by which the sacramental effect is signified: thus water is most
    commonly used by men for bodily cleansing, by which the spiritual cleansing
    is signified: and therefore water is employed as the matter of baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If he who corrupts the pronunciation of
    the sacramental words---does so on purpose, he does not seem to intend to do
    what the Church intends: and thus the sacrament seems to be defective. But
    if he do this through error or a slip of the tongue, and if he so far
    mispronounce the words as to deprive them of sense, the sacrament seems to
    be defective. This would be the case especially if the mispronunciation be
    in the beginning of a word, for instance, if one were to say "in nomine
    matris" instead of "in nomine Patris." If, however, the sense of the words
    be not entirely lost by this mispronunciation, the sacrament is complete.
    This would be the case principally if the end of a word be mispronounced;
    for instance, if one were to say "patrias et filias." For although the words
    thus mispronounced have no appointed meaning, yet we allow them an
    accommodated meaning corresponding to the usual forms of speech. And so,
    although the sensible sound is changed, yet the sense remains the same.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    What has been said about the various mispronunciations of words, either at
    the beginning or at the end, holds forasmuch as with us a change at the
    beginning of a word changes the meaning, whereas a change at the end
    generally speaking does not effect such a change: whereas with the Greeks
    the sense is changed also in the beginning of words in the conjugation of
    verbs.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless the principle point to observe is the extent of the corruption
    entailed by mispronunciation: for in either case it may be so little that it
    does not alter the sense of the words; or so great that it destroys it. But
    it is easier for the one to happen on the part of the beginning of the
    words, and the other at the end.<br />

    Whether it is lawful to add anything to the words in which the sacramental
    form consists?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it is not lawful to add anything to
    the words in which the sacramental form consists. For these sacramental
    words are not of less importance than are the words of Holy Scripture. But
    it is not lawful to add anything to, or to take anything from, the words of
    Holy Scripture: for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++4%3A2"
      >Dt. 4:2</a
    >): "You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall you
    take away from it"; and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++22%3A18,19"
      >Apoc. 22:18,19</a
    >): "I testify to everyone that heareth the words of the prophecy of this
    book: if any man shall add to these things, God shall add to him the plagues
    written in this book. And if any man shall take away... God shall take away
    his part out of the book of life." Therefore it seems that neither is it
    lawful to add anything to, or to take anything from, the sacramental
    forms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the sacraments words are by way of
    form, as stated above (<a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad
    2; <a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A6A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). But any addition or
    subtraction in forms changes the species, as also in numbers (Metaph. viii).
    Therefore it seems that if anything be added to or subtracted from a
    sacramental form, it will not be the same sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the sacramental form demands a
    certain number of words, so does it require that these words should be
    pronounced in a certain order and without interruption. If therefore, the
    sacrament is not rendered invalid by addition or subtraction of words, in
    like manner it seems that neither is it, if the words be pronounced in a
    different order or with interruptions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Certain words are inserted by some in the
    sacramental forms, which are not inserted by others: thus the Latins baptize
    under this form: "I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
    and of the Holy Ghost"; whereas the Greeks use the following form: "The
    servant of God, N... is baptized in the name of the Father," etc. Yet both
    confer the sacrament validly. Therefore it is lawful to add something to, or
    to take something from, the sacramental forms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> With regard to all the variations that may
    occur in the sacramental forms, two points seem to call for our attention.
    one is on the part of the person who says the words, and whose intention is
    essential to the sacrament, as will be explained further on (<a
      href="TP064.html#TPQ64OUTP1"
      >Question [64]</a
    >, <a href="TP064.html#TPQ64A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Wherefore if he
    intends by such addition or suppression to perform a rite other from that
    which is recognized by the Church, it seems that the sacrament is invalid:
    because he seems not to intend to do what the Church does.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The other point to be considered is the meaning of the words. For since in
    the sacraments, the words produce an effect according to the sense which
    they convey, as stated above (<a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A7THEP1"
      >Article [7]</a
    >, ad 1), we must see whether the change of words destroys the essential
    sense of the words: because then the sacrament is clearly rendered invalid.
    Now it is clear, if any substantial part of the sacramental form be
    suppressed, that the essential sense of the words is destroyed; and
    consequently the sacrament is invalid. Wherefore Didymus says (De Spir.
    Sanct. ii): "If anyone attempt to baptize in such a way as to omit one of
    the aforesaid names," i.e. of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, "his baptism
    will be invalid." But if that which is omitted be not a substantial part of
    the form, such an omission does not destroy the essential sense of the
    words, nor consequently the validity of the sacrament. Thus in the form of
    the Eucharist---"For this is My Body," the omission of the word "for" does
    not destroy the essential sense of the words, nor consequently cause the
    sacrament to be invalid; although perhaps he who makes the omission may sin
    from negligence or contempt.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, it is possible to add something that destroys the essential sense of
    the words: for instance, if one were to say: "I baptize thee in the name of
    the Father Who is greater, and of the Son Who is less," with which form the
    Arians baptized: and consequently such an addition makes the sacrament
    invalid. But if the addition be such as not to destroy the essential sense,
    the sacrament is not rendered invalid. Nor does it matter whether this
    addition be made at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end: For
    instance, if one were to say, "I baptize thee in the name of the Father
    Almighty, and of the only Begotten Son, and of the Holy Ghost, the
    Paraclete," the baptism would be valid; and in like manner if one were to
    say, "I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
    Holy Ghost"; and may the Blessed Virgin succour thee, the baptism would be
    valid.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps, however, if one were to say, "I baptize thee in the name of the
    Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and of the Blessed Virgin
    Mary," the baptism would be void; because it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++1%3A13"
      >1 Cor. 1:13</a
    >): "Was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul?"
    But this is true if the intention be to baptize in the name of the Blessed
    Virgin as in the name of the Trinity, by which baptism is consecrated: for
    such a sense would be contrary to faith, and would therefore render the
    sacrament invalid: whereas if the addition, "and in the name of the Blessed
    Virgin" be understood, not as if the name of the Blessed Virgin effected
    anything in baptism, but as intimating that her intercession may help the
    person baptized to preserve the baptismal grace, then the sacrament is not
    rendered void.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is not lawful to add anything to the
    words of Holy Scripture as regards the sense; but many words are added by
    Doctors by way of explanation of the Holy Scriptures. Nevertheless, it is
    not lawful to add even words to Holy Scripture as though such words were a
    part thereof, for this would amount to forgery. It would amount to the same
    if anyone were to pretend that something is essential to a sacramental form,
    which is not so.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Words belong to a sacramental form by
    reason of the sense signified by them. Consequently any addition or
    suppression of words which does not add to or take from the essential sense,
    does not destroy the essence of the sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If the words are interrupted to such an
    extent that the intention of the speaker is interrupted, the sacramental
    sense is destroyed, and consequently, the validity of the sacrament. But
    this is not the case if the interruption of the speaker is so slight, that
    his intention and the sense of the words is not interrupted.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The same is to be said of a change in the order of the words. Because if
    this destroys the sense of the words, the sacrament is invalidated: as
    happens when a negation is made to precede or follow a word. But if the
    order is so changed that the sense of the words does not vary, the sacrament
    is not invalidated, according to the Philosopher's dictum: "Nouns and verbs
    mean the same though they be transposed" (Peri Herm. x).<br />
