    OF THE EFFICIENCY OF CHRIST'S PASSION (SIX ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We now have to consider Christ's Passion as to its effect; first of all, as
    to the manner in which it was brought about; and, secondly, as to the effect
    in itself. Under the first heading there are six points for inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP048.html#TPQ48A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Christ's Passion brought
    about our salvation by way of merit?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP048.html#TPQ48A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it was by way of
    atonement?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP048.html#TPQ48A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it was by way of
    sacrifice?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP048.html#TPQ48A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it was by way of
    redemption?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP048.html#TPQ48A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether it is proper to Christ to
    be the Redeemer?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP048.html#TPQ48A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether (the Passion) secured
    man's salvation efficiently?

    Whether Christ's Passion brought about our salvation by way of merit?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's Passion did not bring
    about our salvation by way of merit. For the sources of our sufferings are
    not within us. But no one merits or is praised except for that whose
    principle lies within him. Therefore Christ's Passion wrought nothing by way
    of merit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, from the beginning of His conception
    Christ merited for Himself and for us, as stated above (<a
      href="TP009.html#TPQ9OUTP1"
      >Question [9]</a
    >, <a href="TP009.html#TPQ9A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="TP034.html#TPQ34OUTP1">Question [34]</a>,
    <a href="TP034.html#TPQ34A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But it is superfluous to
    merit over again what has been merited before. Therefore by His Passion
    Christ did not merit our salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the source of merit is charity. But
    Christ's charity was not made greater by the Passion than it was before.
    Therefore He did not merit our salvation by suffering more than He had
    already.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> on the words of Phil. 2:9, "Therefore God
    exalted Him," etc., Augustine says (Tract. civ in Joan.): "The lowliness" of
    the Passion "merited glory; glory was the reward of lowliness." But He was
    glorified, not merely in Himself, but likewise in His faithful ones, as He
    says Himself (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++17%3A10"
      >Jn. 17:10</a
    >). Therefore it appears that He merited the salvation of the faithful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="TP007.html#TPQ7OUTP1"
      >Question [7]</a
    >, <a href="TP007.html#TPQ7ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,9;
    <a href="TP008.html#TPQ8OUTP1">Question [8]</a>,
    <a href="TP008.html#TPQ8ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,5), grace was bestowed upon
    Christ, not only as an individual, but inasmuch as He is the Head of the
    Church, so that it might overflow into His members; and therefore Christ's
    works are referred to Himself and to His members in the same way as the
    works of any other man in a state of grace are referred to himself. But it
    is evident that whosoever suffers for justice's sake, provided that he be in
    a state of grace, merits his salvation thereby, according to Mt. 5:10:
    "Blessed are they that suffer persecution for justice's sake." Consequently
    Christ by His Passion merited salvation, not only for Himself, but likewise
    for all His members.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Suffering, as such, is caused by an
    outward principle: but inasmuch as one bears it willingly, it has an inward
    principle.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> From the beginning of His conception
    Christ merited our eternal salvation; but on our side there were some
    obstacles, whereby we were hindered from securing the effect of His
    preceding merits: consequently, in order to remove such hindrances, "it was
    necessary for Christ to suffer," as stated above (<a
      href="TP046.html#TPQ46OUTP1"
      >Question [46]</a
    >, <a href="TP046.html#TPQ46A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ's Passion has a special effect,
    which His preceding merits did not possess, not on account of greater
    charity, but because of the nature of the work, which was suitable for such
    an effect, as is clear from the arguments brought forward above all the
    fittingness of Christ's Passion (<a href="TP046.html#TPQ46OUTP1"

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether Christ's Passion brought about our salvation by way of atonement?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's Passion did not bring
    about our salvation by way of atonement. For it seems that to make the
    atonement devolves on him who commits the sin; as is clear in the other
    parts of penance, because he who has done the wrong must grieve over it and
    confess it. But Christ never sinned, according to 1 Pt. 2:22: "Who did no
    sin." Therefore He made no atonement by His personal suffering.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no atonement is made to another by
    committing a graver offense. But in Christ's Passion the gravest of all
    offenses was perpetrated, because those who slew Him sinned most grievously,
    as stated above (<a href="TP047.html#TPQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>,
    <a href="TP047.html#TPQ47A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Consequently it seems
    that atonement could not be made to God by Christ's Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, atonement implies equality with the
    trespass, since it is an act of justice. But Christ's Passion does not
    appear equal to all the sins of the human race, because Christ did not
    suffer in His Godhead, but in His flesh, according to 1 Pt. 4:1: "Christ
    therefore having suffered in the flesh." Now the soul, which is the subject
    of sin, is of greater account than the flesh. Therefore Christ did not atone
    for our sins by His Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++68%3A5"
      >Ps. 68:5</a
    >) in Christ's person: "Then did I pay that which I took not away." But he
    has not paid who has not fully atoned. Therefore it appears that Christ by
    His suffering has fully atoned for our sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> He properly atones for an offense who offers
    something which the offended one loves equally, or even more than he
    detested the offense. But by suffering out of love and obedience, Christ
    gave more to God than was required to compensate for the offense of the
    whole human race. First of all, because of the exceeding charity from which
    He suffered; secondly, on account of the dignity of His life which He laid
    down in atonement, for it was the life of one who was God and man; thirdly,
    on account of the extent of the Passion, and the greatness of the grief
    endured, as stated above (<a href="TP046.html#TPQ46OUTP1">Question [46]</a>,
    <a href="TP046.html#TPQ46A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). And therefore Christ's
    Passion was not only a sufficient but a superabundant atonement for the sins
    of the human race; according to 1 Jn. 2:2: "He is the propitiation for our
    sins: and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The head and members are as one mystic
    person; and therefore Christ's satisfaction belongs to all the faithful as
    being His members. Also, in so far as any two men are one in charity, the
    one can atone for the other as shall be shown later (<a href="../XP.html"
      >XP</a
    >, <a href="../XP/XP013.html#XPQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>,
    <a href="../XP/XP013.html#XPQ13A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But the same
    reason does not hold good of confession and contrition, because atonement
    consists in an outward action, for which helps may be used, among which
    friends are to be computed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ's love was greater than His
    slayers' malice: and therefore the value of His Passion in atoning surpassed
    the murderous guilt of those who crucified Him: so much so that Christ's
    suffering was sufficient and superabundant atonement for His murderer's
    crime.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The dignity of Christ's flesh is not to
    be estimated solely from the nature of flesh, but also from the Person
    assuming it---namely, inasmuch as it was God's flesh, the result of which
    was that it was of infinite worth.<br />

    Whether Christ's Passion operated by way of sacrifice?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's Passion did not
    operate by way of sacrifice. For the truth should correspond with the
    figure. But human flesh was never offered up in the sacrifices of the Old
    Law, which were figures of Christ: nay, such sacrifices were reputed as
    impious, according to Ps. 105:38: "And they shed innocent blood: the blood
    of their sons and of their daughters, which they sacrificed to the idols of
    Chanaan." It seems therefore that Christ's Passion cannot be called a
    sacrifice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x) that "a
    visible sacrifice is a sacrament---that is, a sacred sign---of an invisible
    sacrifice." Now Christ's Passion is not a sign, but rather the thing
    signified by other signs. Therefore it seems that Christ's Passion is not a
    sacrifice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whoever offers sacrifice performs some
    sacred rite, as the very word "sacrifice" shows. But those men who slew
    Christ did not perform any sacred act, but rather wrought a great wrong.
    Therefore Christ's Passion was rather a malefice than a sacrifice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A2"
      >Eph. 5:2</a
    >): "He delivered Himself up for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for
    an odor of sweetness."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A sacrifice properly so called is something
    done for that honor which is properly due to God, in order to appease Him:
    and hence it is that Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x): "A true sacrifice is
    every good work done in order that we may cling to God in holy fellowship,
    yet referred to that consummation of happiness wherein we can be truly
    blessed." But, as is added in the same place, "Christ offered Himself up for
    us in the Passion": and this voluntary enduring of the Passion was most
    acceptable to God, as coming from charity. Therefore it is manifest that
    Christ's Passion was a true sacrifice. Moreover, as Augustine says farther
    on in the same book, "the primitive sacrifices of the holy Fathers were many
    and various signs of this true sacrifice, one being prefigured by many, in
    the same way as a single concept of thought is expressed in many words, in
    order to commend it without tediousness": and, as Augustine observe, (De
    Trin. iv), "since there are four things to be noted in every sacrifice---to
    wit, to whom it is offered, by whom it is offered, what is offered, and for
    whom it is offered---that the same one true Mediator reconciling us with God
    through the peace-sacrifice might continue to be one with Him to whom He
    offered it, might be one with them for whom He offered it, and might Himself
    be the offerer and what He offered."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the truth answers to the figure
    in some respects, yet it does not in all, since the truth must go beyond the
    figure. Therefore the figure of this sacrifice, in which Christ's flesh is
    offered, was flesh right fittingly, not the flesh of men, but of animals, as
    denoting Christ's. And this is a most perfect sacrifice. First of all, since
    being flesh of human nature, it is fittingly offered for men, and is
    partaken of by them under the Sacrament. Secondly, because being passible
    and mortal, it was fit for immolation. Thirdly, because, being sinless, it
    had virtue to cleanse from sins. Fourthly, because, being the offerer's own
    flesh, it was acceptable to God on account of His charity in offering up His
    own flesh. Hence it is that Augustine says (De Trin. iv): "What else could
    be so fittingly partaken of by men, or offered up for men, as human flesh?
    What else could be so appropriate for this immolation as mortal flesh? What
    else is there so clean for cleansing mortals as the flesh born in the womb
    without fleshly concupiscence, and coming from a virginal womb? What could
    be so favorably offered and accepted as the flesh of our sacrifice, which
    was made the body of our Priest?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine is speaking there of visible
    figurative sacrifices: and even Christ's Passion, although denoted by other
    figurative sacrifices, is yet a sign of something to be observed by us,
    according to 1 Pt. 4:1: "Christ therefore, having suffered in the flesh, be
    you also armed with the same thought: for he that hath suffered in the flesh
    hath ceased from sins: that now he may live the rest of his time in the
    flesh, not after the desires of men, but according to the will of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ's Passion was indeed a malefice
    on His slayers' part; but on His own it was the sacrifice of one suffering
    out of charity. Hence it is Christ who is said to have offered this
    sacrifice, and not the executioners.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether Christ's Passion brought about our salvation by way of
    redemption?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's Passion did not
    effect our salvation by way of redemption. For no one purchases or redeems
    what never ceased to belong to him. But men never ceased to belong to God
    according to Ps. 23:1: "The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof: the
    world and all they that dwell therein." Therefore it seems that Christ did
    not redeem us by His Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as Augustine says (De Trin. xiii): "The
    devil had to be overthrown by Christ's justice." But justice requires that
    the man who has treacherously seized another's property shall be deprived of
    it, because deceit and cunning should not benefit anyone, as even human laws
    declare. Consequently, since the devil by treachery deceived and subjugated
    to himself man, who is God's creature, it seems that man ought not to be
    rescued from his power by way of redemption.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whoever buys or redeems an object pays
    the price to the holder. But it was not to the devil, who held us in
    bondage, that Christ paid His blood as the price of our redemption.
    Therefore Christ did not redeem us by His Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Pt++1%3A18"
      >1 Pt. 1:18</a
    >): "You were not redeemed with corruptible things as gold or silver from
    your vain conversation of the tradition of your fathers: but with the
    precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled." And (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A13"
      >Gal. 3:13</a
    >): "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse
    for us." Now He is said to be a curse for us inasmuch as He suffered upon
    the tree, as stated above (<a href="TP046.html#TPQ46OUTP1">Question [46]</a
    >, <a href="TP046.html#TPQ46A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore He did
    redeem us by His Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Man was held captive on account of sin in two
    ways: first of all, by the bondage of sin, because (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++8%3A34"
      >Jn. 8:34</a
    >): "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin"; and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Pt++2%3A19"
      >2 Pt. 2:19</a
    >): "By whom a man is overcome, of the same also he is the slave." Since,
    then, the devil had overcome man by inducing him to sin, man was subject to
    the devil's bondage. Secondly, as to the debt of punishment, to the payment
    of which man was held fast by God's justice: and this, too, is a kind of
    bondage, since it savors of bondage for a man to suffer what he does not
    wish, just as it is the free man's condition to apply himself to what he
    wills.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Since, then, Christ's Passion was a sufficient and a superabundant atonement
    for the sin and the debt of the human race, it was as a price at the cost of
    which we were freed from both obligations. For the atonement by which one
    satisfies for self or another is called the price, by which he ransoms
    himself or someone else from sin and its penalty, according to Dan. 4:24:
    "Redeem thou thy sins with alms." Now Christ made satisfaction, not by
    giving money or anything of the sort, but by bestowing what was of greatest
    price---Himself---for us. And therefore Christ's Passion is called our
    redemption.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Man is said to belong to God in two
    ways. First of all, in so far as he comes under God's power: in which way he
    never ceased to belong to God; according to Dan. 4:22: "The Most High ruleth
    over the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will." Secondly, by
    being united to Him in charity, according to Rm. 8:9: "If any man have not
    the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His." In the first way, then, man never
    ceased to belong to God, but in the second way he did cease because of sin.
    And therefore in so far as he was delivered from sin by the satisfaction of
    Christ's Passion, he is said to be redeemed by the Passion of Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man by sinning became the bondsman both
    of God and of the devil. Through guilt he had offended God, and put himself
    under the devil by consenting to him; consequently he did not become God's
    servant on account of his guilt, but rather, by withdrawing from God's
    service, he, by God's just permission, fell under the devil's servitude on
    account of the offense perpetrated. But as to the penalty, man was chiefly
    bound to God as his sovereign judge, and to the devil as his torturer,
    according to Mt. 5:25: "Lest perhaps the adversary deliver thee to the
    judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer"---that is, "to the
    relentless avenging angel," as Chrysostom says (Hom. xi). Consequently,
    although, after deceiving man, the devil, so far as in him lay, held him
    unjustly in bondage as to both sin and penalty, still it was just that man
    should suffer it. God so permitting it as to the sin and ordaining it as to
    the penalty. And therefore justice required man's redemption with regard to
    God, but not with regard to the devil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Because, with regard to God, redemption
    was necessary for man's deliverance, but not with regard to the devil, the
    price had to be paid not to the devil, but to God. And therefore Christ is
    said to have paid the price of our redemption---His own precious blood---not
    to the devil, but to God.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether it is proper to Christ to be the Redeemer?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not proper to Christ to
    be the Redeemer, because it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++30%3A6"
      >Ps. 30:6</a
    >): "Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of Truth." But to be the Lord
    God of Truth belongs to the entire Trinity. Therefore it is not proper to
    Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he is said to redeem who pays the price
    of redemption. But God the Father gave His Son in redemption for our sins,
    as is written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++110%3A9"
      >Ps. 110:9</a
    >): "The Lord hath sent redemption to His people," upon which the gloss
    adds, "that is, Christ, who gives redemption to captives." Therefore not
    only Christ, but the Father also, redeemed us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, not only Christ's Passion, but also that
    of other saints conduced to our salvation, according to Col. 1:24: "I now
    rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up those things that are wanting
    of the sufferings of Christ, in my flesh for His body, which is the Church."
    Therefore the title of Redeemer belongs not only to Christ, but also to the
    other saints.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A13"
      >Gal. 3:13</a
    >): "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for
    us." But only Christ was made a curse for us. Therefore only Christ ought to
    be called our Redeemer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> For someone to redeem, two things are
    required---namely, the act of paying and the price paid. For if in redeeming
    something a man pays a price which is not his own, but another's, he is not
    said to be the chief redeemer, but rather the other is, whose price it is.
    Now Christ's blood or His bodily life, which "is in the blood," is the price
    of our redemption (Lev. 17:11,14), and that life He paid. Hence both of
    these belong immediately to Christ as man; but to the Trinity as to the
    first and remote cause, to whom Christ's life belonged as to its first
    author, and from whom Christ received the inspiration of suffering for us.
    Consequently it is proper to Christ as man to be the Redeemer immediately;
    although the redemption may be ascribed to the whole Trinity as its first
    cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A gloss explains the text thus: "Thou, O
    Lord God of Truth, hast redeemed me in Christ, crying out, 'Lord, into Thy
    hands I commend my spirit.'" And so redemption belongs immediately to the
    Man-Christ, but principally to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Man-Christ paid the price of our
    redemption immediately, but at the command of the Father as the original
    author.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sufferings of the saints are
    beneficial to the Church, as by way, not of redemption, but of example and
    exhortation, according to 2 Cor. 1:6: "Whether we be in tribulation, it is
    for your exhortation and salvation."<br />

    Whether Christ's Passion brought about our salvation efficiently?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's Passion did not bring
    about our salvation efficiently. For the efficient cause of our salvation is
    the greatness of the Divine power, according to Is. 59:1: "Behold the hand
    of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save." But "Christ was crucified
    through weakness," as it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++13%3A4"
      >2 Cor. 13:4</a
    >). Therefore, Christ's Passion did not bring about our salvation
    efficiently.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no corporeal agency acts efficiently
    except by contact: hence even Christ cleansed the leper by touching him "in
    order to show that His flesh had saving power," as Chrysostom [*Theophylact,
    Enarr. in Luc.] says. But Christ's Passion could not touch all mankind.
    Therefore it could not efficiently bring about the salvation of all men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it does not seem to be consistent for
    the same agent to operate by way of merit and by way of efficiency, since he
    who merits awaits the result from someone else. But it was by way of merit
    that Christ's Passion accomplished our salvation. Therefore it was not by
    way of efficiency.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++1%3A18"
      >1 Cor. 1:18</a
    >) that "the word of the cross to them that are saved... is the power of
    God." But God's power brings about our salvation efficiently. Therefore
    Christ's Passion on the cross accomplished our salvation efficiently.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There is a twofold efficient agency---namely,
    the principal and the instrumental. Now the principal efficient cause of
    man's salvation is God. But since Christ's humanity is the "instrument of
    the Godhead," as stated above (<a href="TP043.html#TPQ43OUTP1"
      >Question [43]</a
    >, <a href="TP043.html#TPQ43A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), therefore all
    Christ's actions and sufferings operate instrumentally in virtue of His
    Godhead for the salvation of men. Consequently, then, Christ's Passion
    accomplishes man's salvation efficiently.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ's Passion in relation to His
    flesh is consistent with the infirmity which He took upon Himself, but in
    relation to the Godhead it draws infinite might from It, according to 1 Cor.
    1:25: "The weakness of God is stronger than men"; because Christ's weakness,
    inasmuch as He is God, has a might exceeding all human power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ's Passion, although corporeal,
    has yet a spiritual effect from the Godhead united: and therefore it secures
    its efficacy by spiritual contact---namely, by faith and the sacraments of
    faith, as the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++3%3A25"
      >Rm. 3:25</a
    >): "Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in His
    blood."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ's Passion, according as it is
    compared with His Godhead, operates in an efficient manner: but in so far as
    it is compared with the will of Christ's soul it acts in a meritorious
    manner: considered as being within Christ's very flesh, it acts by way of
    satisfaction, inasmuch as we are liberated by it from the debt of
    punishment; while inasmuch as we are freed from the servitude of guilt, it
    acts by way of redemption: but in so far as we are reconciled with God it
    acts by way of sacrifice, as shall be shown farther on (<a
      href="TP049.html#TPQ49OUTP1"
      >Question [49]</a
    >).<br />
