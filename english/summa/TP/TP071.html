<H3 Align="Center">OF THE PREPARATIONS THAT ACCOMPANY BAPTISM (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider the preparations that accompany Baptism: 
concerning which there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP071.html#TPQ71A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether catechism should precede Baptism?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP071.html#TPQ71A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether exorcism should precede Baptism?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP071.html#TPQ71A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether what is done in catechizing and exorcizing, effects 
anything, or is a mere sign?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP071.html#TPQ71A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether those who are to be baptized should be catechized or 
exorcized by priests?<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that catechism should not precede Baptism. For by 
Baptism men are regenerated unto the spiritual life. But man begins to 
live before being taught. Therefore man should not be catechized, i.e. 
taught, before being baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Baptism is given not only to adults, but also to 
children, who are not capable of being taught, since they have not the 
use of reason. Therefore it is absurd to catechize them. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a man, when catechized, confesses his faith. Now a child 
cannot confess its faith by itself, nor can anyone else in its stead; 
both because no one can bind another to do anything; and because one 
cannot know whether the child, having come to the right age, will give 
its assent to faith. Therefore catechism should not precede Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Rabanus says (De Instit. Cleric. i): "Before Baptism 
man should be prepared by catechism, in order that the catechumen may 
receive the rudiments of faith."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP070.html#TPQ70OUTP1">Question [70]</a>, <A Href="TP070.html#TPQ70A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), Baptism is the Sacrament 
of Faith: since it is a profession of the Christian faith. Now in order 
that a man receive the faith, he must be instructed therein, according to 
Rm. 10:14: "How shall they believe Him, of Whom they have not heard? And 
how shall they hear without a preacher?" And therefore it is fitting that 
catechism should precede Baptism. Hence when our Lord bade His disciples 
to baptize, He made teaching to precede Baptism, saying: "Go ye . . . and 
teach all nations, baptizing them," etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The life of grace unto which a man is regenerated, 
presupposes the life of the rational nature, in which man is capable of 
receiving instruction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as Mother Church, as stated above (<A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>, <A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 3), 
lends children another's feet that they may come, and another's heart 
that they may believe, so, too, she lends them another's ears, that they 
may hear, and another's mind, that through others they may be taught. And 
therefore, as they are to be baptized, on the same grounds they are to be 
instructed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He who answers in the child's stead: "I do believe," does 
not foretell that the child will believe when it comes to the right age, 
else he would say: "He will believe"; but in the child's stead he 
professes the Church's faith which is communicated to that child, the 
sacrament of which faith is bestowed on it, and to which faith he is 
bound by another. For there is nothing unfitting in a person being bound 
by another in things necessary for salvation. In like manner the sponsor, 
in answering for the child, promises to use his endeavors that the child 
may believe. This, however, would not be sufficient in the case of adults 
having the use of reason.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether exorcism should precede Baptism?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that exorcism should not precede Baptism. For exorcism 
is ordained against energumens or those who are possessed. But not all 
are such like. Therefore exorcism should not precede Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, so long as man is a subject of sin, the devil  has power 
over him, according to Jn. 8:34: "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant 
of sin." But sin is taken away by Baptism. Therefore men should not be 
exorcized before Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Holy water was introduced in order to ward off the power 
of the demons. Therefore exorcism was not needed as a further remedy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Celestine says (Epist. ad Episcop. Galliae): 
"Whether children or young people approach the sacrament of regeneration, 
they should not come to the fount of life before the unclean spirit has 
been expelled from them by the exorcisms and breathings of the clerics."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Whoever purposes to do a work wisely, first removes the 
obstacles to his work; hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++4%3A3">Jer. 4:3</a>): "Break up anew 
your fallow ground and sow not upon thorns." Now the devil is the enemy 
of man's salvation, which man acquires by Baptism; and he has a certain 
power over man from the very fact that the latter is subject to original, 
or even actual, sin. Consequently it is fitting that before Baptism the 
demons should be cast out by exorcisms, lest they impede man's salvation. 
Which expulsion is signified by the (priest) breathing (upon the person 
to be baptized); while the blessing, with the imposition of hands, bars 
the way against the return of him who was cast out. Then the salt which 
is put in the mouth, and the anointing of the nose and ears with spittle, 
signify the receiving of doctrine, as to the ears; consent thereto as to 
the nose; and confession thereof, as to the mouth. And the anointing with 
oil signifies man's ability to fight against the demons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The energumens are so-called from "laboring inwardly" under 
the outward operation of the devil. And though not all that approach 
Baptism are troubled by him in their bodies, yet all who are not baptized 
are subject to the power of the demons, at least on account of the guilt 
of original sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The power of the devil in so far as he hinders man from 
obtaining glory, is expelled from man by the baptismal ablution; but in 
so far as he hinders man from receiving the sacrament, his power is cast 
out by the exorcisms.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Holy water is used against the assaults of demons from 
without. But exorcisms are directed against those assaults of the demons 
which are from within. hence those who are exorcized are called 
energumens, as it were "laboring inwardly."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or we may say that just as Penance is given as a further remedy against 
sin, because Baptism is not repeated; so Holy Water is given as a further 
remedy against the assaults of demons, because the baptismal exorcisms 
are not given a second time.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether what is done in the exorcism effects anything, or is a mere  sign?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that what is done in the exorcism does not effect 
anything, but is a mere sign. For if a child die after the exorcisms, 
before being baptized, it is not saved. But the effects of what is done 
in the sacraments are ordained to the salvation of man; hence it is 
written (Mk. 16:16): "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." 
Therefore what is done in the exorcism effects nothing, but is a mere 
sign.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing is required for a sacrament of the New Law, but 
that it should be a sign and a cause, as stated above (<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). If, 
therefore, the things done in the exorcism effect anything, it seems that 
each of them is a sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the exorcism is ordained to Baptism, so if 
anything be effected in the exorcism, it is ordained to the effect of 
Baptism. But disposition must needs precede the perfect form: because 
form is not received save into matter already disposed. It would follow, 
therefore, that none could obtain the effect of Baptism unless he were 
previously exorcized; which is clearly false. Therefore what is done in 
the exorcisms has no effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, just as some things are done in the exorcism before 
Baptism, so are some things done after Baptism; for instance, the priest 
anoints the baptized on the top of the head. But what is done after 
Baptism seems to have no effect; for, if it had, the effect of Baptism 
would be imperfect. Therefore neither have those things an effect, which 
are done in exorcism before Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Symbolo I): "Little children are 
breathed upon and exorcized, in order to expel from them the devil's 
hostile power, which deceived man." But the Church does nothing in vain. 
Therefore the effect of these breathings is that the power of the devils 
is expelled.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some say that the things done in the exorcism have no 
effect, but are mere signs. But this is clearly false; since in 
exorcizing, the Church uses words of command to cast out the devil's 
power, for instance, when she says: "Therefore, accursed devil, go out 
from him," etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore we must say that they have some effect, but, other than that 
of Baptism. For Baptism gives man grace unto the full remission of sins. 
But those things that are done in the exorcism remove the twofold 
impediment against the reception of saving grace. Of these, one is the 
outward impediment, so far as the demons strive to hinder man's 
salvation. And this impediment is removed by the breathings, whereby the 
demon's power is cast out, as appears from the passage quoted from 
Augustine, i.e. as to the devil not placing obstacles against the 
reception of the sacrament. Nevertheless, the demon's power over man 
remains as to the stain of  sin, and the debt of punishment, until sin be 
washed away by Baptism. And in this sense Cyprian says (Epist. lxxvi): 
"Know that the devil's evil power remains until the pouring of the saving 
water: but in Baptism he loses it all."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other impediment is within, forasmuch as, from having contracted 
original sin, man's sense is closed to the perception of the mysteries of 
salvation. Hence Rabanus says (De Instit. Cleric. i) that "by means of 
the typifying spittle and the touch of the priest, the Divine wisdom and 
power brings salvation to the catechumen, that his nostrils being opened 
he may perceive the odor of the knowledge of God, that his ears be opened 
to hear the commandments of God, that his senses be opened in his inmost 
heart to respond."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> What is done in the exorcism does not take away the sin for 
which man is punished after death; but only the impediments against his 
receiving the remission of sin through the sacrament. Wherefore exorcism 
avails a man nothing after death if he has not been baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Praepositivus, however, says that children who die after being exorcized 
but before being baptized are subjected to lesser darkness. But this does 
not seem to be true: because that darkness consists in privation of the 
vision of God, which cannot be greater or lesser.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is essential to a sacrament to produce its principal 
effect, which is grace that remits sin, or supplies some defect in man. 
But those things that are done in the exorcism do not effect this; they 
merely remove these impediments. Consequently, they are not sacraments 
but sacramentals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The disposition that suffices for receiving the baptismal 
grace is the faith and intention, either of the one baptized, if it be an 
adult, or of the Church, if it be a child. But these things that are done 
in the exorcism, are directed to the removal of the impediments. And 
therefore one may receive the effect of Baptism without them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet they are not to be omitted save in a case of necessity. And then, if 
the danger pass, they should be supplied, that uniformity in Baptism may 
be observed. Nor are they supplied to no purpose after Baptism: because, 
just as the effect of Baptism may be hindered before it is received, so 
can it be hindered after it has been received.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Of those things that are done after Baptism in respect of 
the person baptized, something is done which is not a mere sign, but 
produces an effect, for instance, the anointing on the top of the head, 
the effect of which is the preservation of baptismal grace. And there is 
something which has no effect, but is a mere sign, for instance, the 
baptized are given a white garment to signify the newness of life.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it belongs to a priest to catechize and exorcize the person to be baptized?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it does not belong to a priest to catechize and 
exorcize the person to be baptized. For it belongs to the office of 
ministers to operate on the unclean, as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. v). 
But catechumens who are instructed by catechism, and "energumens" who are 
cleansed by exorcism, are counted among the unclean, as Dionysius says in 
the same place. Therefore to catechize and to exorcize do not belong to 
the office of the priests, but rather to that of the ministers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, catechumens are instructed in the Faith by the Holy 
Scripture which is read in the church by ministers: for just as the Old 
Testament is recited by the Readers, so the New Testament is read by the 
Deacons and Subdeacons. And thus it belongs to the ministers to 
catechize. In like manner it belongs, seemingly, to the ministers to 
exorcize. For Isidore says (Epist. ad Ludifred.): "The exorcist should 
know the exorcisms by heart, and impose his hands on the energumens and 
catechumens during the exorcism." Therefore it belongs not to the 
priestly office to catechize and exorcize.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "to catechize" is the same as "to teach," and this is 
the same as "to perfect." Now this belongs to the office of a bishop, as 
Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. v). Therefore it does not belong to the 
priestly office.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Nicolas I says: "The catechizing of those who are 
to be baptized can be undertaken by the priests attached to each church." 
And Gregory says (Hom. xxix super Ezech.): "When priests place their 
hands on believers for the grace of exorcism, what else do they but cast 
out the devils?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The minister compared to the priest, is as a secondary 
and instrumental agent to the principal agent: as is implied in the very 
word "minister." Now the secondary agent does nothing without the 
principal agent in operating. And the more mighty the operation, so much 
the mightier instruments does the principal agent require. But the 
operation of the priest in conferring the sacrament itself is mightier 
than in those things that are preparatory to the sacrament. And so the 
highest ministers who are called deacons co-operate with the priest in 
bestowing the sacraments themselves: for Isidore says (Epist. ad 
Ludifred.) that "it belongs to the deacons to assist the priests in all 
things that are done in Christ's sacraments, in Baptism, to wit, in the 
Chrism, in the Paten and Chalice"; while the inferior ministers assist 
the priest in those things which are preparatory to the sacraments: the 
readers, for instance, in catechizing; the exorcists in exorcizing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The minister's operation in regard to the unclean is 
ministerial and, as it were, instrumental, but the priest's is principal. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To readers and exorcists belongs the duty of catechizing 
and exorcizing, not, indeed, principally, but as ministers of the priest 
in these things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[71] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Instruction is manifold. one leads to the embracing of the 
Faith; and is ascribed by Dionysius to bishops (Eccl. Hier. ii) and can 
be undertaken by any preacher, or even by any believer. Another is that 
by which a man is taught the rudiments of faith, and how to comport 
himself in receiving the sacraments: this belongs secondarily to the 
ministers, primarily to the priests. A third is instruction in the mode 
of Christian life: and this belongs to the sponsors. A fourth is the 
instruction in the profound mysteries of faith, and on the perfection of 
Christian life: this belongs to bishops "ex officio," in virtue of their 
office.<br>
