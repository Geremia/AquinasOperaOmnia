</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall now consider the predestination of Christ. Under this head 
there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP024.html#TPQ24A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Christ was predestinated?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP024.html#TPQ24A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether He was predestinated as man?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP024.html#TPQ24A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether His predestination is the exemplar of ours?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP024.html#TPQ24A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is the cause of our predestination?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unfitting that Christ should be predestinated. For 
the term of anyone's predestination seems to be the adoption of sons, 
according to Eph. 1:5: "Who hath predestinated us unto the adoption of 
children." But it is not befitting to Christ to be an adopted Son, as 
stated above (<A Href="TP023.html#TPQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="TP023.html#TPQ23A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore it is not fitting that Christ be 
predestinated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we may consider two things in Christ: His human nature 
and His person. But it cannot be said that Christ is predestinated by 
reason of His human nature; for this proposition is false---"The human 
nature is Son of God." In like manner neither by reason of the person; 
for this person is the Son of God, not by  grace, but by nature: whereas 
predestination regards what is of grace, as stated in the FP, Question [23], 
Articles [2],5. Therefore Christ was not predestinated to be the Son of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as that which has been made was not always, so also 
that which was predestinated; since predestination implies a certain 
antecedence. But, because Christ was always God and the Son of God, it 
cannot be said that that Man was "made the Son of God." Therefore, for a 
like reason, we ought not to say that Christ was "predestinated the Son 
of God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says, speaking of Christ (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A4">Rm. 1:4</a>): "Who 
was predestinated the Son of God in power."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As is clear from what has been said in the FP, Question [23], 
Articles [1],2, predestination, in its proper sense, is a certain Divine 
preordination from eternity of those things which are to be done in time 
by the grace of God. Now, that man is God, and that God is man, is 
something done in time by God through the grace of union. Nor can it be 
said that God has not from eternity pre-ordained to do this in time: 
since it would follow that something would come anew into the Divine 
Mind. And we must needs admit that the union itself of natures in the 
Person of Christ falls under the eternal predestination of God. For this 
reason do we say that Christ was predestinated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle there speaks of that predestination by which we 
are predestinated to be adopted sons. And just as Christ in a singular 
manner above all others is the natural Son of God, so in a singular 
manner is He predestinated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As a gloss [*From St. Augustine, De Praed. Sanct. xv] says 
on Rm. 1:4, some understood that predestination to refer to the nature 
and not to the Person---that is to say, that on human nature was bestowed 
the grace of being united to the Son of God in unity of Person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in that case the phrase of the Apostle would be improper, for two 
reasons. First, for a general reason: for we do not speak of a person's 
nature, but of his person, as being predestinated: because to be 
predestinated is to be directed towards salvation, which belongs to a 
suppositum acting for the end of beatitude. Secondly, for a special 
reason. Because to be Son of God is not befitting to human nature; for 
this proposition is false: "The human nature is the Son of God": unless 
one were to force from it such an exposition as: "Who was predestinated 
the Son of God in power"---that is, "It was predestinated that the Human 
nature should be united to the Son of God in the Person."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence we must attribute predestination to the Person of Christ: not, 
indeed, in Himself or as subsisting in the Divine Nature, but as 
subsisting in the human nature. Wherefore the Apostle, after saying, "Who 
was made to Him of the seed of David according to the flesh," added, "Who 
was predestinated the Son of  God in power": so as to give us to 
understand that in respect of His being of the seed of David according to 
the flesh, He was predestinated the Son of God in power. For although it 
is natural to that Person, considered in Himself, to be the Son of God in 
power, yet this is not natural to Him, considered in the human nature, in 
respect of which this befits Him according to the grace of union.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Origen commenting on Rm. 1:4 says that the true reading of 
this passage of the Apostle is: "Who was destined to be the Son of God in 
power"; so that no antecedence is implied. And so there would be no 
difficulty. Others refer the antecedence implied in the participle 
"predestinated," not to the fact of being the Son of God, but to the 
manifestation thereof, according to the customary way of speaking in Holy 
Scripture, by which things are said to take place when they are made 
known; so that the sense would be---"Christ was predestinated to be made 
known as the Son of God." But this is an improper signification of 
predestination. For a person is properly said to be predestinated by 
reason of his being directed to the end of beatitude: but the beatitude 
of Christ does not depend on our knowledge thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore better to say that the antecedence implied in the 
participle "predestinated" is to be referred to the Person not in 
Himself, but by reason of the human nature: since, although that Person 
was the Son of God from eternity, it was not always true that one 
subsisting in human nature was the Son of God. Hence Augustine says (De 
Praedest. Sanct. xv): "Jesus was predestinated, so that He Who according 
to the flesh was to be the son of David, should be nevertheless Son of 
God in power."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, it must be observed that, although the participle 
"predestinated," just as this participle "made," implies antecedence, yet 
there is a difference. For "to be made" belongs to the thing in itself: 
whereas "to be predestinated" belongs to someone as being in the 
apprehension of one who pre-ordains. Now that which is the subject of a 
form or nature in reality, can be apprehended either as under that form 
or absolutely. And since it cannot be said absolutely of the Person of 
Christ that He began to be the Son of God, yet this is becoming to Him as 
understood or apprehended to exist in human nature, because at one time 
it began to be true that one existing in human nature was the Son of God; 
therefore this proposition---"Christ was predestinated the Son of 
God"---is truer than this---"Christ was made the Son of God."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this proposition is false: "Christ as man was 
predestinated to be the Son of God." For at some time a man is that which 
he was predestinated to be: since God's predestination does not fail. If, 
therefore, Christ as man was predestinated the Son of God, it seems to 
follow that as man He is  the Son of God. But the latter is false. 
Therefore the former is false.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what is befitting to Christ as man is befitting to any 
man; since He belongs to the same species as other men. If, therefore, 
Christ, as man, was predestinated the Son of God, it will follow that 
this is befitting to any other man. But the latter is false. Therefore 
the former is false.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that is predestinated from eternity which is to take 
place at some time. But this proposition, "The Son of God was made man," 
is truer than this, "Man was made the Son of God." Therefore this 
proposition, "Christ, as the Son of God, was predestinated to be man," is 
truer than this, "Christ as Man was predestinated to be the Son of God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (De Praedest. Sanct. xv) says: "Forasmuch as 
God the Son was made Man, we say that the Lord of Glory was 
predestinated."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Two things may be considered in predestination. One on 
the part of eternal predestination itself: and in this respect it implies 
a certain antecedence in regard to that which comes under predestination. 
Secondly, predestination may be considered as regards its temporal 
effect, which is some gratuitous gift of God. Therefore from both points 
of view we must say that predestination is ascribed to Christ by reason 
of His human nature alone: for human nature was not always united to the 
Word; and by grace bestowed an it was it united in Person to the Son of 
God. Consequently, by reason of human nature alone can predestination be 
attributed to Christ. Wherefore Augustine says (De Praedest. Sanct. xv): 
"This human nature of ours was predestinated to be raised to so great, so 
lofty, so exalted a position, that it would be impossible to raise it 
higher." Now that is said to belong to anyone as man which belongs to him 
by reason of human nature. Consequently, we must say that "Christ, as 
Man, was predestinated the Son of God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When we say, "Christ, as Man, was predestinated the Son of 
God," this qualification, "as Man," can be referred in two ways to the 
action signified by the participle. First, as regards what comes under 
predestination materially, and thus it is false. For the sense would be 
that it was predestinated that Christ, as Man, should be the Son of God. 
And in this sense the objection takes it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it may be referred to the very nature of the action itself: 
that is, forasmuch as predestination implies antecedence and gratuitous 
effect. And thus predestination belongs to Christ by reason of His human 
nature, as stated above. And in this sense He is said to be predestinated 
as Man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Something may be befitting to a man by reason of human 
nature, in two ways. First, so that human nature be the cause  thereof: 
thus risibility is befitting to Socrates by reason of human nature, being 
caused by its principles. In this manner predestination is not befitting 
either to Christ or to any other man, by reason of human nature. This is 
the sense of the objection. Secondly, a thing may be befitting to someone 
by reason of human nature, because human nature is susceptible of it. And 
in this sense we say that Christ was predestinated by reason of human 
nature; because predestination refers to the exaltation of human nature 
in Him, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Praedest. Sanct. xv): "The Word of God 
assumed Man to Himself in such a singular and ineffable manner that at 
the same time He may be truly and correctly called the Son of Man, 
because He assumed Men to Himself; and the Son of God, because it was the 
Only-begotten of God Who assumed human nature." Consequently, since this 
assumption comes under predestination by reason of its being gratuitous, 
we can say both that the Son of God was predestinated to be man, and that 
the Son of Man was predestinated to be the Son of God. But because grace 
was not bestowed on the Son of God that He might be man, but rather on 
human nature, that it might be united to the Son of God; it is more 
proper to say that "Christ, as Man, was predestinated to be the Son of 
God," than that, "Christ, as Son of God, was predestinated to be Man."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ's predestination is the exemplar of ours?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's predestination is not the exemplar of 
ours. For the exemplar exists before the exemplate. But nothing exists 
before the eternal. Since, therefore, our predestination is eternal, it 
seems that Christ's predestination is not the exemplar of ours.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the exemplar leads us to knowledge of the exemplate. But 
there was no need for God to be led from something else to knowledge of 
our predestination; since it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A29">Rm. 8:29</a>): "Whom He foreknew, He 
also predestinated." Therefore Christ's predestination is not the 
exemplar of ours.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the exemplar is conformed to the exemplate. But Christ's 
predestination seems to be of a different nature from ours: because we 
are predestinated to the sonship of adoption, whereas Christ was 
predestinated "Son of God in power," as is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A4">Rm. 1:4</a>). Therefore 
His predestination is not the exemplar of ours.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Praedest. Sanct. xv): "The Saviour 
Himself, the Mediator of God and men, the Man Christ Jesus is the most 
splendid light of predestination and grace." Now He is called the light 
of predestination and grace, inasmuch as our predestination is made 
manifest by His predestination and grace; and this seems to pertain to 
the nature of an exemplar. Therefore Christ's predestination is the 
exemplar of ours. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Predestination may be considered in two ways. First, on 
the part of the act of predestination: and thus Christ's predestination 
cannot be said to be the exemplar of ours: for in the same way and by the 
same eternal act God predestinated us and Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, predestination may be considered on the part of that to which 
anyone is predestinated, and this is the term and effect of 
predestination. In this sense Christ's predestination is the exemplar of 
ours, and this in two ways. First, in respect of the good to which we are 
predestinated: for He was predestinated to be the natural Son of God, 
whereas we are predestinated to the adoption of sons, which is a 
participated likeness of natural sonship. Whence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A29">Rm. 8:29</a>): "Whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be made conformable to 
the image of His Son." Secondly, in respect of the manner of obtaining 
this good---that is, by grace. This is most manifest in Christ; because 
human nature in Him, without any antecedent merits, was united to the Son 
of God: and of the fulness of His grace we all have received, as it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++1%3A16">Jn. 1:16</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument considers the aforesaid act of the 
predestinator.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The same is to be said of the second objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The exemplate need not be conformed to the exemplar in all 
respects: it is sufficient that it imitate it in some.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's predestination is not the cause of

eternal. Therefore Christ's predestination is not the cause of ours.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which depends on the simple will of God has no 
other cause but God's will. Now, our predestination depends on the simple 
will of God, for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++1%3A11">Eph. 1:11</a>): "Being predestinated 
according to the purpose of Him, Who worketh all things according to the 
counsel of His will." Therefore Christ's predestination is not the cause 
of ours.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the cause be taken away, the effect is also taken 
away. But if we take away Christ's predestination, ours is not taken 
away; since even if the Son of God were not incarnate, our salvation 
might yet have been achieved in a different manner, as Augustine says (De 
Trin. xiii, 10). Therefore Christ's predestination is. not the cause of 
ours.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++1%3A5">Eph. 1:5</a>): "(Who) hath  predestinated us 
unto the adoption of children through Jesus Christ."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[24] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> if we consider predestination on the part of the very act 
of predestinating, then Christ's predestination is not the cause of ours; 
because by one and the same act God predestinated both Christ and us. But 
if we consider predestination on the part of its term, thus Christ's 
predestination is the cause of ours: for God, by predestinating from 
eternity, so decreed our salvation, that it should be achieved through 
Jesus Christ. For eternal predestination covers not only that which is to
