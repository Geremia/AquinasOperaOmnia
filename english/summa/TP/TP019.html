</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the unity of Christ's operation; and under this 
head there are four points of inquiry: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP019.html#TPQ19A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether in Christ there was one or several operations of the Godhead 
and Manhood?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP019.html#TPQ19A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether in Christ there were several operations of the human nature?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP019.html#TPQ19A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether Christ by His human operation merited anything for Himself?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in Christ there is but one operation of the 
Godhead and the Manhood. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ii): "The most 
loving operation of God is made manifest to us by the supersubstantial 
Word having taken flesh integrally and truly, and having operated and 
suffered whatsoever befits His human and Divine operation." But he here 
mentions only one human and Divine operation, which is written in Greek 
{theandrike}, i.e. God-manlike. Hence it seems that there is but one 
composite operation in Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is but one operation of the principal and 
instrumental agent. Now the human nature in Christ was the instrument of 
the Divine, as was said above (<A Href="TP007.html#TPQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>, <A Href="TP007.html#TPQ7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="TP008.html#TPQ8OUTP1">Question [8]</a>, <A Href="TP008.html#TPQ8A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2). Hence the operations of the Divine and human natures in 
Christ are the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since in Christ there are two natures in one hypostasis 
or person, whatever pertains to the hypostasis or person is one and the 
same. But operation pertains to the hypostasis or person, for it is only 
a subsisting suppositum that operates; hence, according to the 
Philosopher (Metaph. i, 1), acts belong to singulars. Hence in Christ 
there is only one operation of the Godhead and the Manhood.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, as being belongs to a subsisting hypostasis, so also 
does operation. But on account of the unity of hypostasis there is only 
one operation of the Godhead and the (<A Href="TP017.html#TPQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>, <A Href="TP017.html#TPQ17A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Hence, on account of 
the same unity, there is one operation in Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, as being belongs to a sub-operated there is one 
operation. But the same thing was operated by the Godhead and the 
Manhood, as the healing of the lepers or the raising of the dead. Hence 
it seems that in Christ there is but one operation of the Godhead and the 
Manhood.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Fide ii, 8): "How can the same 
operation spring from different powers? Cannot the lesser operate as the 
greater? And can there be one operation where there are different 
substances?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the aforesaid  heretics 
who placed one will in Christ placed one operation in Christ. Now in 
order better to understand their erroneous opinion, we must bear in mind 
that wherever there are several mutually ordained agents, the inferior is 
moved by the superior, as in man the body is moved by the soul and the 
lower powers by the reason. And thus the actions and movements of the 
inferior principle are things operated rather than operations. Now what 
pertains to the highest principle is properly the operation; thus we say 
of man that to walk, which belongs to the feet, and to touch, which 
belongs to the hand, are things operated by the man---one of which is 
operated by the soul through the feet, the other through the hands. And 
because it is the same soul that operates in both cases, there is only 
one indifferent operation, on the part of the thing operating, which is 
the first moving principle; but difference is found on the part of what 
is operated. Now, as in a mere man the body is moved by the soul, and the 
sensitive by the rational appetite, so in the Lord Jesus Christ the human 
nature is moved and ruled by the Divine. Hence they said that there is 
one indifferent operation on the part of the Godhead operating, but 
divers things operated, inasmuch as the Godhead of Christ did one thing 
by Itself, as to uphold all things by the word of His power---and another 
thing by His human nature, as to walk in body. Hence the Sixth Council 
[*Third Council of Constantinople, Act. 10] quotes the words of Severus 
the heretic, who said: "What things were done and wrought by the one 
Christ, differ greatly; for some are becoming to God, and some are human, 
as to walk bodily on the earth is indeed human, but to give hale steps to 
sickly limbs, wholly unable to walk on the ground, is becoming to God. 
Yet one, i.e. the Incarnate Word, wrought one and the other---neither was 
this from one nature, and that from another; nor can we justly affirm 
that because there are distinct things operated there are therefore two 
operating natures and forms."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But herein they were deceived, for what is moved by another has a 
twofold action---one which it has from its own form---the other, which it 
has inasmuch as it is moved by another; thus the operation of an axe of 
itself is to cleave; but inasmuch as it is moved by the craftsman, its 
operation is to make benches. Hence the operation which belongs to a 
thing by its form is proper to it, nor does it belong to the mover, 
except in so far as he makes use of this kind of thing for his work: thus 
to heat is the proper operation of fire, but not of a smith, except in so 
far as he makes use of fire for heating iron. But the operation which 
belongs to the thing, as moved by another, is not distinct from the 
operation of the mover; thus to make a bench is not the work of the axe 
independently of the workman. Hence, wheresoever the mover and the moved 
have different forms or operative faculties, there must the operation of 
the mover and the proper operation of the moved be distinct; although the 
moved shares in the operation of the mover, and the mover makes use of 
the operation of the moved, and, consequently, each acts in communion 
with the other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore in Christ the human nature has its proper form and power 
whereby it acts; and so has the Divine. Hence the human  nature has its 
proper operation distinct from the Divine, and conversely. Nevertheless, 
the Divine Nature makes use of the operation of the human nature, as of 
the operation of its instrument; and in the same way the human nature 
shares in the operation of the Divine Nature, as an instrument shares in 
the operation of the principal agent. And this is what Pope Leo says (Ep. 
ad Flavian. xxviii): "Both forms" (i.e. both the Divine and the human 
nature in Christ) "do what is proper to each in union with the other, 
i.e. the Word operates what belongs to the Word, and the flesh carries 
out what belongs to flesh."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But if there were only one operation of the Godhead and manhood in 
Christ, it would be necessary to say either that the human nature had not 
its proper form and power (for this could not possibly be said of the 
Divine), whence it would follow that in Christ there was only the Divine 
operation; or it would be necessary to say that from the Divine and human 
power there was made up one power. Now both of these are impossible. For 
by the first the human nature in Christ is supposed to be imperfect; and 
by the second a confusion of the natures is supposed. Hence it is with 
reason that the Sixth Council (Act. 18) condemned this opinion, and 
decreed as follows: "We confess two natural, indivisible, unconvertible, 
unconfused, and inseparable operations in the same Lord Jesus Christ our 
true God"; i.e. the Divine operation and the human operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Dionysius places in Christ a theandric, i.e. a God-manlike 
or Divino-human, operation not by any confusion of the operations or 
powers of both natures, but inasmuch as His Divine operation employs the 
human, and His human operation shares in the power of the Divine. Hence, 
as he says in a certain epistle (Ad Caium iv), "what is of man He works 
beyond man; and this is shown by the Virgin conceiving supernaturally and 
by the unstable waters bearing up the weight of bodily feet." Now it is 
clear that to be begotten belongs to human nature, and likewise to walk; 
yet both were in Christ supernaturally. So, too, He wrought Divine things 
humanly, as when He healed the leper with a touch. Hence in the same 
epistle he adds: "He performed Divine works not as God does, and human 
works not as man does, but, God having been made man, by a new operation 
of God and man."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, that he understood two operations in Christ, one of the Divine and 
the other of the human nature, is clear from what he says, Div. Nom. ii: 
"Whatever pertains to His human operation the Father and the Holy Ghost 
no-wise share in, except, as one might say, by their most gracious and 
merciful will," i.e. inasmuch as the Father and the Holy Ghost in their 
mercy wished Christ to do and to suffer human things. And he adds: "He is 
truly the unchangeable God, and God's Word by the sublime and unspeakable 
operation of God, which, being made man for us, He wrought." Hence it is 
clear that the human operation, in which the Father and the Holy Ghost do 
not share, except by Their merciful consent, is distinct from His 
operation, as the Word of God, wherein the Father and the Holy Ghost 
share. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The instrument is said to act through being moved by the 
principal agent; and yet, besides this, it can have its proper operation 
through its own form, as stated above of fire. And hence the action of 
the instrument as instrument is not distinct from the action of the 
principal agent; yet it may have another operation, inasmuch as it is a 
thing. Hence the operation of Christ's human nature, as the instrument of 
the Godhead, is not distinct from the operation of the Godhead; for the 
salvation wherewith the manhood of Christ saves us and that wherewith His 
Godhead saves us are not distinct; nevertheless, the human nature in 
Christ, inasmuch as it is a certain nature, has a proper operation 
distinct from the Divine, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To operate belongs to a subsisting hypostasis; in 
accordance, however, with the form and nature from which the operation 
receives its species. Hence from the diversity of forms or natures spring 
the divers species of operations, but from the unity of hypostasis 
springs the numerical unity as regards the operation of the species: thus 
fire has two operations specifically different, namely, to illuminate and 
to heat, from the difference of light and heat, and yet the illumination 
of the fire that illuminates at one and the same time is numerically one. 
So, likewise, in Christ there are necessarily two specifically different 
operations by reason of His two natures; nevertheless, each of the 
operations at one and the same time is numerically one, as one walking 
and one healing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Being and operation belong to the person by reason of the 
nature; yet in a different manner. For being belongs to the very 
constitution of the person, and in this respect it has the nature of a 
term; consequently, unity of person requires unity of the complete and 
personal being. But operation is an effect of the person by reason of a 
form or nature. Hence plurality of operations is not incompatible with 
personal unity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The proper work of the Divine operation is different from 
the proper work of the human operation. Thus to heal a leper is a proper 
work of the Divine operation, but to touch him is the proper work of the 
human operation. Now both these operations concur in one work, inasmuch 
as one nature acts in union with the other.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in Christ there are several human operations?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in Christ there are several human operations. 
For Christ as man communicates with plants by His nutritive soul, with 
the brutes by His sensitive soul, and with the angels by His intellective 
soul, even as other men do. Now the operations of a plant as plant and of 
an animal as animal are different. Therefore Christ as man has several 
operations.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, powers and habits are distinguished by their  acts. Now 
in Christ's soul there were divers powers and habits; therefore also 
divers operations.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, instruments ought to be proportioned to their 
operations. Now the human body has divers members of different form, and 
consequently fitted to divers operations. Therefore in Christ there are 
divers operations in the human nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> As Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 15), "operation 
is consequent upon the nature." But in Christ there is only one human 
nature. Therefore in Christ there is only one human operation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since it is by his reason that man is what he is; that 
operation is called human simply, which proceeds from the reason through 
the will, which is the rational appetite. Now if there is any operation 
in man which does not proceed from the reason and the will, it is not 
simply a human operation, but belongs to man by reason of some part of 
human nature---sometimes by reason of the nature of elementary bodies, as 
to be borne downwards---sometimes by reason of the force of the 
vegetative soul, as to be nourished, and to grow---sometimes by reason of 
the sensitive part, as to see and hear, to imagine and remember, to 
desire and to be angry. Now between these operations there is a 
difference. For the operations of the sensitive soul are to some extent 
obedient to reason, and consequently they are somewhat rational and human 
inasmuch as they obey reason, as is clear from the Philosopher (Ethic. i, 
13). But the operations that spring from the vegetative soul, or from the 
nature of elemental bodies, are not subject to reason; consequently they 
are nowise rational; nor simply human, but only as regards a part of 
human nature. Now it was said (<A Href="TP019.html#TPQ19A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that when a subordinate agent acts 
by its own form, the operations of the inferior and of the superior agent 
are distinct; but when the inferior agent acts only as moved by the 
superior agent, then the operation of the superior and the inferior agent 
is one.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And hence in every mere man the operations of the elemental body and of 
the vegetative soul are distinct from the will's operation, which is 
properly human; so likewise the operations of the sensitive soul inasmuch 
as it is not moved by reason; but inasmuch as it is moved by reason, the 
operations of the sensitive and the rational part are the same. Now there 
is but one operation of the rational part if we consider the principle of 
the operation, which is the reason and the will; but the operations are 
many if we consider their relationship to various objects. And there were 
some who called this a diversity of things operated rather than of 
operations, judging the unity of the operation solely from the operative 
principle. And it is in this respect that we are now considering the 
unity and plurality of operations in Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence in every mere man there is but one operation, which is properly 
called human; but besides this there are in a mere man certain other 
operations, which are not strictly human, as was said  above. But in the 
Man Jesus Christ there was no motion of the sensitive part which was not 
ordered by reason. Even the natural and bodily operations pertained in 
some respects to His will, inasmuch as it was His will "that His flesh 
should do and suffer what belonged to it," as stated above (<A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="TP018.html#TPQ18A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). 
Much more, therefore, is there one operation in Christ, than in any other 
man whatsoever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The operations of the sensitive and nutritive parts are not 
strictly human, as stated above; yet in Christ these operations were more 
human than in others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Powers and habits are diversified by comparison with their 
objects. Hence in this way the diversity of operations corresponds to the 
divers powers and habits, as likewise to the divers objects. Now we do 
not wish to exclude this diversity of operations from Christ's humanity, 
nor that which springs from a diversity of time, but only that which 
regards the first active principle, as was said above.<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; (St. Thomas gives no reply to Objection [3]; some codices add: Hence may be 
gathered the reply to the third objection.)<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the human action of Christ could be meritorious to Him?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the human action of Christ could not be 
meritorious to Him. For before His death Christ was a comprehensor even 
as He is now. But comprehensors do not merit: because the charity of the 
comprehensor belongs to the reward of beatitude, since fruition depends 
upon it. Hence it does not seem to be the principle of merit, since merit 
and reward are not the same. Therefore Christ before His passion did not 
merit, even as He does not merit now.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one merits what is due to him. But because Christ is 
the Son of God by nature, the eternal inheritance is due to Him, which 
other men merit by their works. And hence Christ Who, from the beginning, 
was the Word of God, could not merit anything for Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whoever has the principle does not properly merit what 
flows from its possession. But Christ has the glory of the soul, whence, 
in the natural course, flowed the glory of the body, as Augustine says 
(Ep. ad Dios cxviii); though by a dispensation it was brought about that 
in Christ the glory of the soul should not overflow to the body. Hence 
Christ did not merit the glory of the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the manifestation of Christ's excellence is a good, not 
of Christ Himself, but of those who know Him. Hence it is promised as a 
reward to such as love Christ that He will be manifested to them, 
according to Jn. 14:21: "He that loveth Me, shall be loved of My Father, 
and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him." Therefore Christ 
did not merit the manifestation of  His greatness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++2%3A8,9">Phil. 2:8,9</a>): "Becoming obedient unto 
death . . . For which cause God also hath exalted Him." Therefore by 
obeying He merited His exaltation and thus He merited something for 
Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> To have any good thing of oneself is more excellent than 
to have it from another, for "what is of itself a cause is always more 
excellent than what is a cause through another," as is said Phys. viii, 
5. Now a thing is said to have, of itself, that of which it is to some 
extent the cause. But of whatever good we possess the first cause by 
authority is God; and in this way no creature has any good of itself, 
according to 1 Cor. 4:7: "What hast thou that thou hast not received?" 
Nevertheless, in a secondary manner anyone may be a cause, to himself, of 
having certain good things, inasmuch as he cooperates with God in the 
matter, and thus whoever has anything by his own merit has it, in a 
manner, of himself. Hence it is better to have a thing by merit than 
without merit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now since all perfection and greatness must be attributed to Christ, 
consequently He must have by merit what others have by merit; unless it 
be of such a nature that its want would detract from Christ's dignity and 
perfection more than would accrue to Him by merit. Hence He merited 
neither grace nor knowledge nor the beatitude of His soul, nor the 
Godhead, because, since merit regards only what is not yet possessed, it 
would be necessary that Christ should have been without these at some 
time; and to be without them would have diminished Christ's dignity more 
than His merit would have increased it. But the glory of the body, and 
the like, are less than the dignity of meriting, which pertains to the 
virtue of charity. Hence we must say that Christ had, by merit, the glory 
of His body and whatever pertained to His outward excellence, as His 
Ascension, veneration, and the rest. And thus it is clear that He could 
merit for Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Fruition, which is an act of charity, pertains to the glory 
of the soul, which Christ did not merit. Hence if He merited by charity, 
it does not follow that the merit and the reward are the same. Nor did He 
merit by charity inasmuch as it was the charity of a comprehensor, but 
inasmuch as it was that of a wayfarer. For He was at once a wayfarer and 
a comprehensor, as was said above (<A Href="TP015.html#TPQ15OUTP1">Question [15]</a>, <A Href="TP015.html#TPQ15A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>). And therefore, since He 
is no longer a wayfarer, He is not in the state of meriting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Because by nature Christ is God and the Son of God, the 
Divine glory and the lordship of all things are due to Him, as to the 
first and supreme Lord. Nevertheless a glory is due to Him as a beatified 
man; and this He has partly without merit, and partly with merit, as is 
clear from what has been said.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is by Divine appointment that there is an overflow of 
glory from the soul to the body, in keeping with human  merit; so that as 
man merits by the act of the soul which he performs in the body, so he 
may be rewarded by the glory of the soul overflowing to the body. And 
hence not only the glory of the soul, but also the glory of the body 
falls under merit, according to Rm. 8:11: "He . . . shall quicken also 
our [Vulg.: 'your'] mortal bodies, because of His Spirit that dwelleth in 
us [Vulg.: 'you']." And thus it could fall under Christ's merit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The manifestation of Christ's excellence is His good as 
regards the being which it has in the knowledge of others; although in 
regard to the being which they have in themselves it chiefly belongs to 
the good of those who know Him. Yet even this is referred to Christ 
inasmuch as they are His members.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ could merit for others?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ could not merit for others. For it is 
written (Ezech. 18:4): "The soul that sinneth, the same shall die." 
Hence, for a like reason, the soul that meriteth, the same shall be 
recompensed. Therefore it is not possible that Christ merited for others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, of the fulness of Christ's grace we all receive, as is 
written Jn. 1:16. Now other men having Christ's grace cannot merit for 
others. For it is written (Ezech. 14:20) that if "Noe and Daniel and Job 
be in the city [Vulg.: 'the midst thereof'] . . . they shall deliver 
neither son nor daughter; but they shall only deliver their own souls by 
their justice." Hence Christ could not merit anything for us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the "reward" that we merit is due "according to justice 
[Vulg.: 'debt'] and not according to grace," as is clear from Rm. 4:4. 
Therefore if Christ merited our salvation it follows that our salvation 
is not by God's grace but by justice, and that He acts unjustly with 
those whom He does not save, since Christ's merit extends to all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A18">Rm. 5:18</a>): "As by the offense of one, 
unto all men to condemnation; so also by the justice of one, unto all men 
to justification of life." But Adam's demerits reached to the 
condemnation of others. Much more, therefore, does the merit of Christ 
reach others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP008.html#TPQ8OUTP1">Question [8]</a>, <A Href="TP008.html#TPQ8ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,5), grace was in Christ not 
merely as in an individual, but also as in the Head of the whole Church, 
to Whom all are united, as members to a head, who constitute one mystical 
person. And hence it is that Christ's merit extends to others inasmuch as 
they are His members; even as in a man the action of the head reaches in 
a manner to all his members, since it perceives not merely for itself 
alone, but for all the members.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The sin of an individual harms himself alone; but  the sin 
of Adam, who was appointed by God to be the principle of the whole 
nature, is transmitted to others by carnal propagation. So, too, the 
merit of Christ, Who has been appointed by God to be the head of all men 
in regard to grace, extends to all His members.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Others receive of Christ's fulness not indeed the fount of 
grace, but some particular grace. And hence it need not be that men merit 
for others, as Christ did.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[19] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the sin of Adam reaches others only by carnal 
generation, so, too, the merit of Christ reaches others only by spiritual 
regeneration, which takes place in baptism; wherein we are incorporated 
with Christ, according to Gal. 3:27, "As many of you as have been 
baptized in Christ, have put on Christ"; and it is by grace that it is 
granted to man to be incorporated with Christ. And thus man's salvation 
is from grace.<br>
