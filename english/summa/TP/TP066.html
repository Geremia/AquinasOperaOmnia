    BAPTISM (Questions [66]-71)<br />
    <br />
    OF THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM (TWELVE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We have now to consider each sacrament specially: (1) Baptism; (2)
    Confirmation; (3) the Eucharist; (4) Penance; (5) Extreme Unction; (6)
    Order; (7) Matrimony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Concerning the first, our consideration will be twofold: (1) of Baptism
    itself; (2) of things preparatory to Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Concerning the first, four points arise for our consideration: (1) Things
    pertaining to the sacrament of Baptism; (2) The minister of this sacrament;
    (3) The recipients of this sacrament; (4) The effect of this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Concerning the first there are twelve points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A1THEP1">(1)</a> What is Baptism? Is it a washing?
  </p>

    this sacrament: "I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
    and of the Holy Ghost"?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether one could baptize with
    this form: "I baptize thee in the name of Christ?"<br />
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether Baptism is the mere washing?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Baptism is not the mere washing.
    For the washing of the body is something transitory: but Baptism is
    something permanent. Therefore Baptism is not the mere washing; but rather
    is it "the regeneration, the seal, the safeguarding, the enlightenment," as
    Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Hugh of St. Victor says (De Sacram. ii)
    that "Baptism is water sanctified by God's word for the blotting out of
    sins." But the washing itself is not water, but a certain use of water.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Tract. lxxx super
    Joan.): "The word is added to the element, and this becomes a sacrament."
    Now, the element is the water. Therefore Baptism is the water and not the
    washing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 34:30): "He that
    washeth himself [baptizatur] after touching the dead, if he touch him again,
    what does his washing avail?" It seems, therefore, that Baptism is the
    washing or bathing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the sacrament of Baptism, three things may
    be considered: namely, that which is "sacrament only"; that which is
    "reality and sacrament"; and that which is "reality only." That which is
    sacrament only, is something visible and outward; the sign, namely, of the
    inward effect: for such is the very nature of a sacrament. And this outward
    something that can be perceived by the sense is both the water itself and
    its use, which is the washing. Hence some have thought that the water itself
    is the sacrament: which seems to be the meaning of the passage quoted from
    Hugh of St. Victor. For in the general definition of a sacrament he says
    that it is "a material element": and in defining Baptism he says it is
    "water."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But this is not true. For since the sacraments of the New Law effect a
    certain sanctification, there the sacrament is completed where the
    sanctification is completed. Now, the sanctification is not completed in
    water; but a certain sanctifying instrumental virtue, not permanent but
    transient, passes from the water, in which it is, into man who is the
    subject of true sanctification. Consequently the sacrament is not completed
    in the very water, but in applying the water to man, i.e. in the washing.
    Hence the Master (iv, 3) says that "Baptism is the outward washing of the
    body done together with the prescribed form of words."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The Baptismal character is both reality and sacrament: because it is
    something real signified by the outward washing; and a sacramental sign of
    the inward justification: and this last is the reality only, in this
    sacrament---namely, the reality signified and not signifying.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That which is both sacrament and
    reality---i.e. the character---and that which is reality only---i.e. the
    inward justification---remain: the character remains and is indelible, as
    stated above (<a href="TP063.html#TPQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>,
    <a href="TP063.html#TPQ63A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>); the justification
    remains, but can be lost. Consequently Damascene defined Baptism, not as to
    that which is done outwardly, and is the sacrament only; but as to that
    which is inward. Hence he sets down two things as pertaining to the
    character---namely, "seal" and "safeguarding"; inasmuch as the character
    which is called a seal, so far as itself is concerned, safeguards the soul
    in good. He also sets down two things as pertaining to the ultimate reality
    of the sacrament---namely, "regeneration" which refers to the fact that man
    by being baptized begins the new life of righteousness; and "enlightenment,"
    which refers especially to faith, by which man receives spiritual life,
    according to Habac 2 (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++10%3A38;+cf++Habac+2:4"
      >Heb. 10:38; cf. Habac 2:4</a
    >): "But (My) just man liveth by faith"; and Baptism is a sort of
    protestation of faith; whence it is called the "Sacrament of Faith."
    Likewise Dionysius defined Baptism by its relation to the other sacraments,
    saying (Eccl. Hier. ii) that it is "the principle that forms the habits of
    the soul for the reception of those most holy words and sacraments"; and
    again by its relation to heavenly glory, which is the universal end of all
    the sacraments, when he adds, "preparing the way for us, whereby we mount to
    the repose of the heavenly kingdom"; and again as to the beginning of
    spiritual life, when he adds, "the conferring of our most sacred and Godlike
    regeneration."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As already stated, the opinion of Hugh
    of St. Victor on this question is not to be followed. Nevertheless the
    saying that "Baptism is water" may be verified in so far as water is the
    material principle of Baptism: and thus there would be "causal
    predication."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When the words are added, the element
    becomes a sacrament, not in the element itself, but in man, to whom the
    element is applied, by being used in washing him. Indeed, this is signified
    by those very words which are added to the element, when we say: "I baptize
    thee," etc.<br />

    Whether Baptism was instituted after Christ's Passion?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Baptism was instituted after
    Christ's Passion. For the cause precedes the effect. Now Christ's Passion
    operates in the sacraments of the New Law. Therefore Christ's Passion
    precedes the institution of the sacraments of the New Law: especially the
    sacrament of Baptism since the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++6%3A3"
      >Rm. 6:3</a
    >): "All we, who are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in His death,"
    etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sacraments of the New Law derive
    their efficacy from the mandate of Christ. But Christ gave the disciples the
    mandate of Baptism after His Passion and Resurrection, when He said: "Going,
    teach ye all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father," etc. (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++28%3A19"
      >Mt. 28:19</a
    >). Therefore it seems that Baptism was instituted after Christ's
    Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Baptism is a necessary sacrament, as
    stated above (<a href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>): wherefore, seemingly, it
    must have been binding on man as soon as it was instituted. But before
    Christ's Passion men were not bound to be baptized: for Circumcision was
    still in force, which was supplanted by Baptism. Therefore it seems that
    Baptism was not instituted before Christ's Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says in a sermon on the Epiphany
    (Append. Serm., clxxxv): "As soon as Christ was plunged into the waters, the
    waters washed away the sins of all." But this was before Christ's Passion.
    Therefore Baptism was instituted before Christ's Passion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1"
      >Question [62]</a
    >, <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), sacraments derive
    from their institution the power of conferring grace. Wherefore it seems
    that a sacrament is then instituted, when it receives the power of producing
    its effect. Now Baptism received this power when Christ was baptized.
    Consequently Baptism was truly instituted then, if we consider it as a
    sacrament. But the obligation of receiving this sacrament was proclaimed to
    mankind after the Passion and Resurrection. First, because Christ's Passion
    put an end to the figurative sacraments, which were supplanted by Baptism
    and the other sacraments of the New Law. Secondly, because by Baptism man is
    "made conformable" to Christ's Passion and Resurrection, in so far as he
    dies to sin and begins to live anew unto righteousness. Consequently it
    behooved Christ to suffer and to rise again, before proclaiming to man his
    obligation of conforming himself to Christ's Death and Resurrection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Even before Christ's Passion, Baptism,
    inasmuch as it foreshadowed it, derived its efficacy therefrom; but not in
    the same way as the sacraments of the Old Law. For these were mere figures:
    whereas Baptism derived the power of justifying from Christ Himself, to
    Whose power the Passion itself owed its saving virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It was not meet that men should be
    restricted to a number of figures by Christ, Who came to fulfil and replace
    the figure by His reality. Therefore before His Passion He did not make
    Baptism obligatory as soon as it was instituted; but wished men to become
    accustomed to its use; especially in regard to the Jews, to whom all things
    were figurative, as Augustine says (Contra Faust. iv). But after His Passion
    and Resurrection He made Baptism obligatory, not only on the Jews, but also
    on the Gentiles, when He gave the commandment: "Going, teach ye all
    nations."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sacraments are not obligatory except
    when we are commanded to receive them. And this was not before the Passion,
    as stated above. For our Lord's words to Nicodemus (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A5"
      >Jn. 3:5</a
    >), "Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter
    into the kingdom of God, seem to refer to the future rather than to the
    present."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether water is the proper matter of Baptism?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that water is not the proper matter of
    Baptism. For Baptism, according to Dionysius (Eccl. Hier. v) and Damascene
    (De Fide Orth. iv), has a power of enlightening. But enlightenment is a
    special characteristic of fire. Therefore Baptism should be conferred with
    fire rather than with water: and all the more since John the Baptist said
    when foretelling Christ's Baptism (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++3%3A11"
      >Mt. 3:11</a
    >): "He shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the washing away of sins is signified in
    Baptism. But many other things besides water are employed in washing, such
    as wine, oil, and such like. Therefore Baptism can be conferred with these
    also; and consequently water is not the proper matter of Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the sacraments of the Church flowed from
    the side of Christ hanging on the cross, as stated above (<a
      href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1"
      >Question [62]</a
    >, <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). But not only water
    flowed therefrom, but also blood. Therefore it seems that Baptism can also
    be conferred with blood. And this seems to be more in keeping with the
    effect of Baptism, because it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++1%3A5"
      >Apoc. 1:5</a
    >): "(Who) washed us from our sins in His own blood."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, as Augustine (cf. Master of the
    Sentences, iv, 3) and Bede (Exposit. in Luc. iii, 21) say, Christ, by "the
    touch of His most pure flesh, endowed the waters with a regenerating and
    cleansing virtue." But all waters are not connected with the waters of the
    Jordan which Christ touched with His flesh. Consequently it seems that
    Baptism cannot be conferred with any water; and therefore water, as such, is
    not the proper matter of Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, if water, as such, were the proper
    matter of Baptism, there would be no need to do anything to the water before
    using it for Baptism. But in solemn Baptism the water which is used for
    baptizing, is exorcized and blessed. Therefore it seems that water, as such,
    is not the proper matter of Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A5"
      >Jn. 3:5</a
    >): "Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter
    into the kingdom of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> By Divine institution water is the proper
    matter of Baptism; and with reason. First, by reason of the very nature of
    Baptism, which is a regeneration unto spiritual life. And this answers to
    the nature of water in a special degree; wherefore seeds, from which all
    living things, viz. plants and animals are generated, are moist and akin to
    water. For this reason certain philosophers held that water is the first
    principle of all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, in regard to the effects of Baptism, to which the properties of
    water correspond. For by reason of its moistness it cleanses; and hence it
    fittingly signifies and causes the cleansing from sins. By reason of its
    coolness it tempers superfluous heat: wherefore it fittingly mitigates the
    concupiscence of the fomes. By reason of its transparency, it is susceptive
    of light; hence its adaptability to Baptism as the "sacrament of Faith."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, because it is suitable for the signification of the mysteries of
    Christ, by which we are justified. For, as Chrysostom says (Hom. xxv in
    Joan.) on Jn. 3:5, "Unless a man be born again," etc., "When we dip our
    heads under the water as in a kind of tomb our old man is buried, and being
    submerged is hidden below, and thence he rises again renewed."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Fourthly, because by being so universal and abundant, it is a matter
    suitable to our need of this sacrament: for it can easily be obtained
    everywhere.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Fire enlightens actively. But he who is
    baptized does not become an enlightener, but is enlightened by faith, which
    "cometh by hearing" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++10%3A17"
      >Rm. 10:17</a
    >). Consequently water is more suitable, than fire, for Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But when we find it said: "He shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire,"
    we may understand fire, as Jerome says (In Matth. ii), to mean the Holy
    Ghost, Who appeared above the disciples under the form of fiery tongues (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+2%3A3"
      >Acts 2:3</a
    >). Or we may understand it to mean tribulation, as Chrysostom says (Hom.
    iii in Matth.): because tribulation washes away sin, and tempers
    concupiscence. Or again, as Hilary says (Super Matth. ii) that "when we have
    been baptized in the Holy Ghost," we still have to be "perfected by the fire
    of the judgment."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Wine and oil are not so commonly used
    for washing, as water. Neither do they wash so efficiently: for whatever is
    washed with them, contracts a certain smell therefrom; which is not the case
    if water be used. Moreover, they are not so universal or so abundant as
    water.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Water flowed from Christ's side to wash
    us; blood, to redeem us. Wherefore blood belongs to the sacrament of the
    Eucharist, while water belongs to the sacrament of Baptism. Yet this latter
    sacrament derives its cleansing virtue from the power of Christ's blood.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Christ's power flowed into all waters,
    by reason of, not connection of place, but likeness of species, as Augustine
    says in a sermon on the Epiphany (Append. Serm. cxxxv): "The blessing that
    flowed from the Saviour's Baptism, like a mystic river, swelled the course
    of every stream, and filled the channels of every spring."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The blessing of the water is not
    essential to Baptism, but belongs to a certain solemnity, whereby the
    devotion of the faithful is aroused, and the cunning of the devil hindered
    from impeding the baptismal effect.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether plain water is necessary for Baptism?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that plain water is not necessary for
    Baptism. For the water which we have is not plain water; as appears
    especially in sea-water, in which there is a considerable proportion of the
    earthly element, as the Philosopher shows (Meteor. ii). Yet this water may
    be used for Baptism. Therefore plain and pure water is not necessary for
    Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the solemn celebration of Baptism,
    chrism is poured into the water. But this seems to take away the purity and
    plainness of the water. Therefore pure and plain water is not necessary for
    Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the water that flowed from the side of
    Christ hanging on the cross was a figure of Baptism, as stated above (<a
      href="TP066.html#TPQ66A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >, ad 3). But that water, seemingly, was not pure, because the elements do
    not exist actually in a mixed body, such as Christ's. Therefore it seems
    that pure or plain water is not necessary for Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, lye does not seem to be pure water, for
    it has the properties of heating and drying, which are contrary to those of
    water. Nevertheless it seems that lye can be used for Baptism; for the water
    of the Baths can be so used, which has filtered through a sulphurous vein,
    just as lye percolates through ashes. Therefore it seems that plain water is
    not necessary for Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, rose-water is distilled from roses, just
    as chemical waters are distilled from certain bodies. But seemingly, such
    like waters may be used in Baptism; just as rain-water, which is distilled
    from vapors. Since, therefore, such waters are not pure and plain water, it
    seems that pure and plain water is not necessary for Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The proper matter of Baptism is water, as
    stated above (<a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But plain
    water alone has the nature of water. Therefore pure plain water is necessary
    for Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Water may cease to be pure or plain water in
    two ways: first, by being mixed with another body; secondly, by alteration.
    And each of these may happen in a twofold manner; artificially and
    naturally. Now art fails in the operation of nature: because nature gives
    the substantial form, which art cannot give; for whatever form is given by
    art is accidental; except perchance when art applies a proper agent to its
    proper matter, as fire to a combustible; in which manner animals are
    produced from certain things by way of putrefaction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Whatever artificial change, then, takes place in the water, whether by
    mixture or by alteration, the water's nature is not changed. Consequently
    such water can be used for Baptism: unless perhaps such a small quantity of
    water be mixed artificially with a body that the compound is something other
    than water; thus mud is earth rather than water, and diluted wine is wine
    rather than water.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if the change be natural, sometimes it destroys the nature of the water;
    and this is when by a natural process water enters into the substance of a
    mixed body: thus water changed into the juice of the grape is wine,
    wherefore it has not the nature of water. Sometimes, however, there may be a
    natural change of the water, without destruction of species: and this, both
    by alteration, as we may see in the case of water heated by the sun; and by
    mixture, as when the water of a river has become muddy by being mixed with
    particles of earth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must therefore say that any water may be used for Baptism, no matter how
    much it may be changed, as long as the species of water is not destroyed;
    but if the species of water be destroyed, it cannot be used for Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The change in sea-water and in other
    waters which we have to hand, is not so great as to destroy the species of
    water. And therefore such waters may be used for Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Chrism does not destroy the nature of
    the water by being mixed with it: just as neither is water changed wherein
    meat and the like are boiled: except the substance boiled be so dissolved
    that the liquor be of a nature foreign to water; in this we may be guided by
    the specific gravity [spissitudine]. If, however, from the liquor thus
    thickened plain water be strained, it can be used for Baptism: just as water
    strained from mud, although mud cannot be used for baptizing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The water which flowed from the side of
    Christ hanging on the cross, was not the phlegmatic humor, as some have
    supposed. For a liquid of this kind cannot be used for Baptism, as neither
    can the blood of an animal, or wine, or any liquid extracted from plants. It
    was pure water gushing forth miraculously like the blood from a dead body,
    to prove the reality of our Lord's body, and confute the error of the
    Manichees: water, which is one of the four elements, showing Christ's body
    to be composed of the four elements; blood, proving that it was composed of
    the four humors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Baptism may be conferred with lye and
    the waters of Sulphur Baths: because such like waters are not incorporated,
    artificially or naturally, with certain mixed bodies, and suffer only a
    certain alteration by passing through certain bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Rose-water is a liquid distilled from
    roses: consequently it cannot be used for Baptism. For the same reason
    chemical waters cannot be used, as neither can wine. Nor does the comparison
    hold with rain-water, which for the most part is formed by the condensing of
    vapors, themselves formed from water, and contains a minimum of the liquid
    matter from mixed bodies; which liquid matter by the force of nature, which
    is stronger than art, is transformed in this process of condensation into
    real water, a result which cannot be produced artificially. Consequently
    rain-water retains no properties of any mixed body; which cannot be said of
    rose-water or chemical waters.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether this be a suitable form of Baptism: "I baptize thee in the name of
    the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost"?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that this is not a suitable form of
    Baptism: "I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
    the Holy Ghost." For action should be ascribed to the principal agent rather
    than to the minister. Now the minister of a sacrament acts as an instrument,
    as stated above (<a href="TP064.html#TPQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>,
    <a href="TP064.html#TPQ64A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>); while the principal
    agent in Baptism is Christ, according to Jn. 1:33, "He upon Whom thou shalt
    see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, He it is that baptizeth."
    It is therefore unbecoming for the minister to say, "I baptize thee": the
    more so that "Ego" [I] is understood in the word "baptizo" [I baptize], so
    that it seems redundant.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is no need for a man who does an
    action, to make mention of the action done; thus he who teaches, need not
    say, "I teach you." Now our Lord gave at the same time the precepts both of
    baptizing and of teaching, when He said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++28%3A19"
      >Mt. 28:19</a
    >): "Going, teach ye all nations," etc. Therefore there is no need in the
    form of Baptism to mention the action of baptizing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the person baptized sometimes does not
    understand the words; for instance, if he be deaf, or a child. But it is
    useless to address such a one; according to Ecclus. 32:6: "Where there is no
    hearing, pour not out words." Therefore it is unfitting to address the
    person baptized with these words: "I baptize thee."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it may happen that several are baptized
    by several at the same time; thus the apostles on one day baptized three
    thousand, and on another, five thousand (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+2,4"
      >Acts 2,4</a
    >). Therefore the form of Baptism should not be limited to the singular
    number in the words, "I baptize thee": but one should be able to say, "We
    baptize you."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Baptism derives its power from Christ's
    Passion. But Baptism is sanctified by the form. Therefore it seems that
    Christ's Passion should be mentioned in the form of Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, a name signifies a thing's property. But
    there are three Personal Properties of the Divine Persons, as stated in the
    FP, Question [32], Article [3]. Therefore we should not say, "in the name,"
    but "in the names of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, the Person of the Father is designated
    not only by the name Father, but also by that of "Unbegotten and Begetter";
    and the Son by those of "Word," "Image," and "Begotten"; and the Holy Ghost
    by those of "Gift," "Love," and the "Proceeding One." Therefore it seems
    that Baptism is valid if conferred in these names.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++28%3A19"
      >Mt. 28:19</a
    >): "Going... teach ye all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
    Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Baptism receives its consecration from its
    form, according to Eph. 5:26: "Cleansing it by the laver of water in the
    word of life." And Augustine says (De Unico Baptismo iv) that "Baptism is
    consecrated by the words of the Gospel." Consequently the cause of Baptism
    needs to be expressed in the baptismal form. Now this cause is twofold; the
    principal cause from which it derives its virtue, and this is the Blessed
    Trinity; and the instrumental cause, viz. the minister who confers the
    sacrament outwardly. Wherefore both causes should be expressed in the form
    of Baptism. Now the minister is designated by the words, "I baptize thee";
    and the principal cause in the words, "in the name of the Father, and of the
    Son, and of the Holy Ghost." Therefore this is the suitable form of Baptism:
    "I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
    Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Action is attributed to an instrument as
    to the immediate agent; but to the principal agent inasmuch as the
    instrument acts in virtue thereof. Consequently it is fitting that in the
    baptismal form the minister should be mentioned as performing the act of
    baptizing, in the words, "I baptize thee"; indeed, our Lord attributed to
    the ministers the act of baptizing, when He said: "Baptizing them," etc. But
    the principal cause is indicated as conferring the sacrament by His own
    power, in the words, "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
    Holy Ghost": for Christ does not baptize without the Father and the Holy
    Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The Greeks, however, do not attribute the act of baptizing to the minister,
    in order to avoid the error of those who in the past ascribed the baptismal
    power to the baptizers, saying (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++1%3A12"
      >1 Cor. 1:12</a
    >): "I am of Paul... and I of Cephas." Wherefore they use the form: "May the
    servant of Christ, N..., be baptized, in the name of the Father," etc. And
    since the action performed by the minister is expressed with the invocation
    of the Trinity, the sacrament is validly conferred. As to the addition of
    "Ego" in our form, it is not essential; but it is added in order to lay
    greater stress on the intention.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since a man may be washed with water for
    several reasons, the purpose for which it is done must be expressed by the
    words of the form. And this is not done by saying: "In the name of the
    Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost"; because we are bound to do
    all things in that Name (Col. 3:17). Wherefore unless the act of baptizing
    be expressed, either as we do, or as the Greeks do, the sacrament is not
    valid; according to the decretal of Alexander III: "If anyone dip a child
    thrice in the water in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
    Holy Ghost, Amen, without saying, I baptize thee in the name of the Father,
    and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen, the child is not baptized."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The words which are uttered in the
    sacramental forms, are said not merely for the purpose of signification, but
    also for the purpose of efficiency, inasmuch as they derive efficacy from
    that Word, by Whom "all things were made." Consequently they are becomingly
    addressed not only to men, but also to insensible creatures; for instance,
    when we say: "I exorcize thee, creature salt" (Roman Ritual).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Several cannot baptize one at the same
    time: because an action is multiplied according to the number of the agents,
    if it be done perfectly by each. So that if two were to combine, of whom one
    were mute, and unable to utter the words, and the other were without hands,
    and unable to perform the action, they could not both baptize at the same
    time, one saying the words and the other performing the action.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, in a case of necessity, several could be baptized at the
    same time; for no single one of them would receive more than one baptism.
    But it would be necessary, in that case, to say: "I baptize ye." Nor would
    this be a change of form, because "ye" is the same as "thee and thee."
    Whereas "we" does not mean "I and I," but "I and thou"; so that this would
    be a change of form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise it would be a change of form to say, "I baptize myself":
    consequently no one can baptize himself. For this reason did Christ choose
    to be baptized by John (Extra, De Baptismo et ejus effectu, cap.
    Debitum).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Although Christ's Passion is the
    principal cause as compared to the minister, yet it is an instrumental cause
    as compared to the Blessed Trinity. For this reason the Trinity is mentioned
    rather than Christ's Passion.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Although there are three personal names
    of the three Persons, there is but one essential name. Now the Divine power
    which works in Baptism, pertains to the Essence; and therefore we say, "in
    the name," and not, "in the names."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> Just as water is used in Baptism,
    because it is more commonly employed in washing, so for the purpose of
    designating the three Persons, in the form of Baptism, those names are
    chosen, which are generally used, in a particular language, to signify the
    Persons. Nor is the sacrament valid if conferred in any other names.<br />

    Whether Baptism can be conferred in the name of Christ?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Baptism can be conferred in the
    name of Christ. For just as there is "one Faith," so is there "one Baptism"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++4%3A5">Eph. 4:5</a>).
    But it is related (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+8%3A12"
      >Acts 8:12</a
    >) that "in the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized, both men and
    women." Therefore now also can Baptism be conferred in the name of
    Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Ambrose says (De Spir. Sanct. i): "If
    you mention Christ, you designate both the Father by Whom He was anointed,
    and the Son Himself, Who was anointed, and the Holy Ghost with Whom He was
    anointed." But Baptism can be conferred in the name of the Trinity:
    therefore also in the name of Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Pope Nicholas I, answering questions put
    to him by the Bulgars, said: "Those who have been baptized in the name of
    the Trinity, or only in the name of Christ, as we read in the Acts of the
    Apostles (it is all the same, as Blessed Ambrose saith), must not be
    rebaptized." But they would be baptized again if they had not been validly
    baptized with that form. Therefore Baptism can be celebrated in the name of
    Christ by using this form: "I baptize thee in the name of Christ."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Pelagius II wrote to the Bishop
    Gaudentius: "If any people living in your Worship's neighborhood, avow that
    they have been baptized in the name of the Lord only, without any hesitation
    baptize them again in the name of the Blessed Trinity, when they come in
    quest of the Catholic Faith." Didymus, too, says (De Spir. Sanct.): "If
    indeed there be such a one with a mind so foreign to faith as to baptize
    while omitting one of the aforesaid names," viz. of the three Persons, "he
    baptizes invalidly."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP064.html#TPQ64OUTP1"
      >Question [64]</a
    >, <a href="TP064.html#TPQ64A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), the sacraments derive
    their efficacy from Christ's institution. Consequently, if any of those
    things be omitted which Christ instituted in regard to a sacrament, it is
    invalid; save by special dispensation of Him Who did not bind His power to
    the sacraments. Now Christ commanded the sacrament of Baptism to be given
    with the invocation of the Trinity. And consequently whatever is lacking to
    the full invocation of the Trinity, destroys the integrity of Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nor does it matter that in the name of one Person another is implied, as the
    name of the Son is implied in that of the Father, or that he who mentions
    the name of only one Person may believe aright in the Three; because just as
    a sacrament requires sensible matter, so does it require a sensible form.
    Hence, for the validity of the sacrament it is not enough to imply or to
    believe in the Trinity, unless the Trinity be expressed in sensible words.
    For this reason at Christ's Baptism, wherein was the source of the
    sanctification of our Baptism, the Trinity was present in sensible signs:
    viz. the Father in the voice, the Son in the human nature, the Holy Ghost in
    the dove.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It was by a special revelation from
    Christ that in the primitive Church the apostles baptized in the name of
    Christ; in order that the name of Christ, which was hateful to Jews and
    Gentiles, might become an object of veneration, in that the Holy Ghost was
    given in Baptism at the invocation of that Name.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Ambrose here gives this reason why
    exception could, without inconsistency, be allowed in the primitive Church;
    namely, because the whole Trinity is implied in the name of Christ, and
    therefore the form prescribed by Christ in the Gospel was observed in its
    integrity, at least implicitly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Pope Nicolas confirms his words by
    quoting the two authorities given in the preceding objections: wherefore the
    answer to this is clear from the two solutions given above.<br />

  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that immersion in water is necessary for
    Baptism. Because it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++4%3A5"
      >Eph. 4:5</a
    >): "One faith, one baptism." But in many parts of the world the ordinary
    way of baptizing is by immersion. Therefore it seems that there can be no
    Baptism without immersion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++6%3A3,4"
      >Rm. 6:3,4</a
    >): "All we who are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in His death: for
    we are buried together with Him, by Baptism into death." But this is done by
    immersion: for Chrysostom says on Jn. 3:5: "Unless a man be born again of
    water and the Holy Ghost," etc.: "When we dip our heads under the water as
    in a kind of tomb, our old man is buried, and being submerged, is hidden
    below, and thence he rises again renewed." Therefore it seems that immersion
    is essential to Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if Baptism is valid without total
    immersion of the body, it would follow that it would be equally sufficient
    to pour water over any part of the body. But this seems unreasonable; since
    original sin, to remedy which is the principal purpose of Baptism, is not in
    only one part of the body. Therefore it seems that immersion is necessary
    for Baptism, and that mere sprinkling is not enough.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++10%3A22"
      >Heb. 10:22</a
    >): "Let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our
    hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with clean
    water."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the sacrament of Baptism water is put to the
    use of a washing of the body, whereby to signify the inward washing away of
    sins. Now washing may be done with water not only by immersion, but also by
    sprinkling or pouring. And, therefore, although it is safer to baptize by
    immersion, because this is the more ordinary fashion, yet Baptism can be
    conferred by sprinkling or also by pouring, according to Ezech. 36:25: "I
    will pour upon you clean water," as also the Blessed Lawrence is related to
    have baptized. And this especially in cases of urgency: either because there
    is a great number to be baptized, as was clearly the case in Acts 2 and 4,
    where we read that on one day three thousand believed, and on another five
    thousand: or through there being but a small supply of water, or through
    feebleness of the minister, who cannot hold up the candidate for Baptism; or
    through feebleness of the candidate, whose life might be endangered by
    immersion. We must therefore conclude that immersion is not necessary for
    Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> What is accidental to a thing does not
    diversify its essence. Now bodily washing with water is essential to
    Baptism: wherefore Baptism is called a "laver," according to Eph. 5:26:
    "Cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life." But that the
    washing be done this or that way, is accidental to Baptism. And consequently
    such diversity does not destroy the oneness of Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ's burial is more clearly
    represented by immersion: wherefore this manner of baptizing is more
    frequently in use and more commendable. Yet in the other ways of baptizing
    it is represented after a fashion, albeit not so clearly; for no matter how
    the washing is done, the body of a man, or some part thereof, is put under
    water, just as Christ's body was put under the earth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The principal part of the body,
    especially in relation to the exterior members, is the head, wherein all the
    senses, both interior and exterior, flourish. And therefore, if the whole
    body cannot be covered with water, because of the scarcity of water, or
    because of some other reason, it is necessary to pour water over the head,
    in which the principle of animal life is made manifest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And although original sin is transmitted through the members that serve for
    procreation, yet those members are not to be sprinkled in preference to the
    head, because by Baptism the transmission of original sin to the offspring
    by the act of procreation is not deleted, but the soul is freed from the
    stain and debt of sin which it has contracted. Consequently that part of the
    body should be washed in preference, in which the works of the soul are made
    manifest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless in the Old Law the remedy against original sin was affixed to
    the member of procreation; because He through Whom original sin was to be
    removed, was yet to be born of the seed of Abraham, whose faith was
    signified by circumcision according to Rm. 4:11.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether trine immersion is essential to Baptism?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that trine immersion is essential to
    Baptism. For Augustine says in a sermon on the Symbol, addressed to the
    Neophytes: "Rightly were you dipped three times, since you were baptized in
    the name of the Trinity. Rightly were you dipped three times, because you
    were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, Who on the third day rose again
    from the dead. For that thrice repeated immersion reproduces the burial of
    the Lord by which you were buried with Christ in Baptism." Now both seem to
    be essential to Baptism, namely, that in Baptism the Trinity of Persons
    should be signified, and that we should be conformed to Christ's burial.
    Therefore it seems that trine immersion is essential to Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sacraments derive their efficacy
    from Christ's mandate. But trine immersion was commanded by Christ: for Pope
    Pelagius II wrote to Bishop Gaudentius: "The Gospel precept given by our
    Lord God Himself, our Saviour Jesus Christ, admonishes us to confer the
    sacrament of Baptism to each one in the name of the Trinity and also with
    trine immersion." Therefore, just as it is essential to Baptism to call on
    the name of the Trinity, so is it essential to baptize by trine
    immersion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if trine immersion be not essential to
    Baptism, it follows that the sacrament of Baptism is conferred at the first
    immersion; so that if a second or third immersion be added, it seems that
    Baptism is conferred a second or third time. which is absurd. Therefore one
    immersion does not suffice for the sacrament of Baptism, and trine immersion
    is essential thereto.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory wrote to the Bishop Leander: "It
    cannot be in any way reprehensible to baptize an infant with either a trine
    or a single immersion: since the Trinity can be represented in the three
    immersions, and the unity of the Godhead in one immersion."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    I answer that As stated above (<a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A7THEP1"
      >Article [7]</a
    >, ad 1), washing with water is of itself required for Baptism, being
    essential to the sacrament: whereas the mode of washing is accidental to the
    sacrament. Consequently, as Gregory in the words above quoted explains, both
    single and trine immersion are lawful considered in themselves; since one
    immersion signifies the oneness of Christ's death and of the Godhead; while
    trine immersion signifies the three days of Christ's burial, and also the
    Trinity of Persons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But for various reasons, according as the Church has ordained, one mode has
    been in practice, at one time, the other at another time. For since from the
    very earliest days of the Church some have had false notions concerning the
    Trinity, holding that Christ is a mere man, and that He is not called the
    "Son of God" or "God" except by reason of His merit, which was chiefly in
    His death; for this reason they did not baptize in the name of the Trinity,
    but in memory of Christ's death, and with one immersion. And this was
    condemned in the early Church. Wherefore in the Apostolic Canons (xlix) we
    read: "If any priest or bishop confer baptism not with the trine immersion
    in the one administration, but with one immersion, which baptism is said to
    be conferred by some in the death of the Lord, let him be deposed": for our
    Lord did not say, "Baptize ye in My death," but "In the name of the Father
    and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Later on, however, there arose the error of certain schismatics and heretics
    who rebaptized: as Augustine (Super. Joan., cf. De Haeres. lxix) relates of
    the Donatists. Wherefore, in detestation of their error, only one immersion
    was ordered to be made, by the (fourth) council of Toledo, in the acts of
    which we read: "In order to avoid the scandal of schism or the practice of
    heretical teaching let us hold to the single baptismal immersion."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But now that this motive has ceased, trine immersion is universally observed
    in Baptism: and consequently anyone baptizing otherwise would sin gravely,
    through not following the ritual of the Church. It would, however, be valid
    Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Trinity acts as principal agent in
    Baptism. Now the likeness of the agent enters into the effect, in regard to
    the form and not in regard to the matter. Wherefore the Trinity is signified
    in Baptism by the words of the form. Nor is it essential for the Trinity to
    be signified by the manner in which the matter is used; although this is
    done to make the signification clearer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In like manner Christ's death is sufficiently represented in the one
    immersion. And the three days of His burial were not necessary for our
    salvation, because even if He had been buried or dead for one day, this
    would have been enough to consummate our redemption: yet those three days
    were ordained unto the manifestation of the reality of His death, as stated
    above (<a href="TP053.html#TPQ53OUTP1">Question [53]</a>,
    <a href="TP053.html#TPQ53A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). It is therefore clear
    that neither on the part of the Trinity, nor on the part of Christ's
    Passion, is the trine immersion essential to the sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Pope Pelagius understood the trine
    immersion to be ordained by Christ in its equivalent; in the sense that
    Christ commanded Baptism to be conferred "in the name of the Father, and of
    the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." Nor can we argue from the form to the use
    of the matter, as stated above (ad 1).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP064.html#TPQ64OUTP1"
      >Question [64]</a
    >, <a href="TP064.html#TPQ64A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>), the intention is
    essential to Baptism. Consequently, one Baptism results from the intention
    of the Church's minister, who intends to confer one Baptism by a trine
    immersion. Wherefore Jerome says on Eph. 4:5,6: "Though the Baptism," i.e.
    the immersion, "be thrice repeated, on account of the mystery of the
    Trinity, yet it is reputed as one Baptism."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, the intention were to confer one Baptism at each immersion
    together with the repetition of the words of the form, it would be a sin, in
    itself, because it would be a repetition of Baptism.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether Baptism may be reiterated?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Baptism may be reiterated. For
    Baptism was instituted, seemingly, in order to wash away sins. But sins are
    reiterated. Therefore much more should Baptism be reiterated: because
    Christ's mercy surpasses man's guilt.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, John the Baptist received special
    commendation from Christ, Who said of him (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++11%3A11"
      >Mt. 11:11</a
    >): "There hath not risen among them that are born of women, a greater than
    John the Baptist." But those whom John had baptized were baptized again,
    according to Acts 19:1-7, where it is stated that Paul rebaptized those who
    had received the Baptism of John. Much more, therefore, should those be
    rebaptized, who have been baptized by heretics or sinners.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it was decreed in the Council of Nicaea
    (Can. xix) that if "any of the Paulianists or Cataphrygians should be
    converted to the Catholic Church, they were to be baptized": and this
    seemingly should be said in regard to other heretics. Therefore those whom
    the heretics have baptized, should be baptized again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Baptism is necessary for salvation. But
    sometimes there is a doubt about the baptism of those who really have been
    baptized. Therefore it seems that they should be baptized again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the Eucharist is a more perfect
    sacrament than Baptism, as stated above (<a href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1"
      >Question [65]</a
    >, <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But the sacrament of
    the Eucharist is reiterated. Much more reason, therefore, is there for
    Baptism to be reiterated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written, (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++4%3A5"
      >Eph. 4:5</a
    >): "One faith, one Baptism."
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Baptism cannot be reiterated.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, because Baptism is a spiritual regeneration; inasmuch as a man dies
    to the old life, and begins to lead the new life. Whence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A5"
      >Jn. 3:5</a
    >): "Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, He cannot see
    [Vulg.: 'enter into'] the kingdom of God." Now one man can be begotten but
    once. Wherefore Baptism cannot be reiterated, just as neither can carnal
    generation. Hence Augustine says on Jn. 3:4: "'Can he enter a second time
    into his mother's womb and be born again': So thou," says he, "must
    understand the birth of the Spirit, as Nicodemus understood the birth of the
    flesh.... As there is no return to the womb, so neither is there to
    Baptism."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, because "we are baptized in Christ's death," by which we die unto
    sin and rise again unto "newness of life" (cf. Rm. 6:3,4). Now "Christ died"
    but "once" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++6%3A10"
      >Rm. 6:10</a
    >). Wherefore neither should Baptism be reiterated. For this reason (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++6%3A6"
      >Heb. 6:6</a
    >) is it said against some who wished to be baptized again: "Crucifying
    again to themselves the Son of God"; on which the gloss observes: "Christ's
    one death hallowed the one Baptism."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, because Baptism imprints a character, which is indelible, and is
    conferred with a certain consecration. Wherefore, just as other
    consecrations are not reiterated in the Church, so neither is Baptism. This
    is the view expressed by Augustine, who says (Contra Epist. Parmen. ii) that
    "the military character is not renewed": and that "the sacrament of Christ
    is not less enduring than this bodily mark, since we see that not even
    apostates are deprived of Baptism, since when they repent and return they
    are not baptized anew."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Fourthly, because Baptism is conferred principally as a remedy against
    original sin. Wherefore, just as original sin is not renewed, so neither is
    Baptism reiterated, for as it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A18"
      >Rm. 5:18</a
    >), "as by the offense of one, unto all men to condemnation, so also by the
    justice of one, unto all men to justification of life."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Baptism derives its efficacy from
    Christ's Passion, as stated above (<a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, ad 1). Wherefore, just as subsequent sins do not cancel the virtue of
    Christ's Passion, so neither do they cancel Baptism, so as to call for its
    repetition. on the other hand the sin which hindered the effect of Baptism
    is blotted out on being submitted to Penance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says on Jn. 1:33: "'And I
    knew Him not': Behold; after John had baptized, Baptism was administered;
    after a murderer has baptized, it is not administered: because John gave his
    own Baptism; the murderer, Christ's; for that sacrament is so sacred, that
    not even a murderer's administration contaminates it."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Paulianists and Cataphrygians used
    not to baptize in the name of the Trinity. Wherefore Gregory, writing to the
    Bishop Quiricus, says: "Those heretics who are not baptized in the name of
    the Trinity, such as the Bonosians and Cataphrygians" (who were of the same
    mind as the Paulianists), "since the former believe not that Christ is God"
    (holding Him to be a mere man), "while the latter," i.e. the Cataphrygians,
    "are so perverse as to deem a mere man," viz. Montanus, "to be the Holy
    Ghost: all these are baptized when they come to holy Church, for the baptism
    which they received while in that state of error was no Baptism at all, not
    being conferred in the name of the Trinity." On the other hand, as set down
    in De Eccles. Dogm. xxii: "Those heretics who have been baptized in the
    confession of the name of the Trinity are to be received as already baptized
    when they come to the Catholic Faith."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> According to the Decretal of Alexander
    III: "Those about whose Baptism there is a doubt are to be baptized with
    these words prefixed to the form: 'If thou art baptized, I do not rebaptize
    thee; but if thou art not baptized, I baptize thee,' etc.: for that does not
    appear to be repeated, which is not known to have been done."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Both sacraments, viz. Baptism and the
    Eucharist, are a representation of our Lord's death and Passion, but not in
    the same way. For Baptism is a commemoration of Christ's death in so far as
    man dies with Christ, that he may be born again into a new life. But the
    Eucharist is a commemoration of Christ's death, in so far as the suffering
    Christ Himself is offered to us as the Paschal banquet, according to 1 Cor.
    5:7,8: "Christ our pasch is sacrificed; therefore let us feast." And
    forasmuch as man is born once, whereas he eats many times, so is Baptism
    given once, but the Eucharist frequently.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the Church observes a suitable rite in baptizing?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the Church observes an unsuitable
    rite in baptizing. For as Chrysostom (Chromatius, in Matth. 3:15) says: "The
    waters of Baptism would never avail to purge the sins of them that believe,
    had they not been hallowed by the touch of our Lord's body." Now this took
    place at Christ's Baptism, which is commemorated in the Feast of the
    Epiphany. Therefore solemn Baptism should be celebrated at the Feast of the
    Epiphany rather than on the eves of Easter and Whitsunday.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it seems that several matters should not
    be used in the same sacrament. But water is used for washing in Baptism.
    Therefore it is unfitting that the person baptized should be anointed thrice
    with holy oil first on the breast, and then between the shoulders, and a
    third time with chrism on the top of the head.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "in Christ Jesus... there is neither
    male nor female" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A23"
      >Gal. 3:23</a
    >)... "neither Barbarian nor Scythian" (Col. 3:11), nor, in like manner, any
    other such like distinctions. Much less, therefore can a difference of
    clothing have any efficacy in the Faith of Christ. It is consequently
    unfitting to bestow a white garment on those who have been baptized.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Baptism can be celebrated without such
    like ceremonies. Therefore it seems that those mentioned above are
    superfluous; and consequently that they are unsuitably inserted by the
    Church in the baptismal rite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Church is ruled by the Holy Ghost, Who
    does nothing inordinate.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the sacrament of Baptism something is done
    which is essential to the sacrament, and something which belongs to a
    certain solemnity of the sacrament. Essential indeed, to the sacrament are
    both the form which designates the principal cause of the sacrament; and the
    minister who is the instrumental cause; and the use of the matter, namely,
    washing with water, which designates the principal sacramental effect. But
    all the other things which the Church observes in the baptismal rite, belong
    rather to a certain solemnity of the sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And these, indeed, are used in conjunction with the sacrament for three
    reasons. First, in order to arouse the devotion of the faithful, and their
    reverence for the sacrament. For if there were nothing done but a mere
    washing with water, without any solemnity, some might easily think it to be
    an ordinary washing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, for the instruction of the faithful. Because simple and unlettered
    folk need to be taught by some sensible signs, for instance, pictures and
    the like. And in this way by means of the sacramental ceremonies they are
    either instructed, or urged to seek the signification of such like sensible
    signs. And consequently, since, besides the principal sacramental effect,
    other things should be known about Baptism, it was fitting that these also
    should be represented by some outward signs.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, because the power of the devil is restrained, by prayers,
    blessings, and the like, from hindering the sacramental effect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ was baptized on the Epiphany with
    the Baptism of John, as stated above (<a href="TP039.html#TPQ39OUTP1"
      >Question [39]</a
    >, <a href="TP039.html#TPQ39A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), with which baptism,
    indeed, the faithful are not baptized, rather are they baptized with
    Christ's Baptism. This has its efficacy from the Passion of Christ,
    according to Rm. 6:3: "We who are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in
    His death"; and in the Holy Ghost, according to Jn. 3:5: "Unless a man be
    born again of water and the Holy Ghost." Therefore it is that solemn Baptism
    is held in the Church, both on Easter Eve, when we commemorate our Lord's
    burial and resurrection; for which reason our Lord gave His disciples the
    commandment concerning Baptism as related by Matthew (28:19): and on
    Whitsun-eve, when the celebration of the Feast of the Holy Ghost begins; for
    which reason the apostles are said to have baptized three thousand on the
    very day of Pentecost when they had received the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The use of water in Baptism is part of
    the substance of the sacrament; but the use of oil or chrism is part of the
    solemnity. For the candidate is first of all anointed with Holy oil on the
    breast and between the shoulders, as "one who wrestles for God," to use
    Ambrose's expression (De Sacram. i): thus are prize-fighters wont to besmear
    themselves with oil. Or, as Innocent III says in a decretal on the Holy
    Unction: "The candidate is anointed on the breast, in order to receive the
    gift of the Holy Ghost, to cast off error and ignorance, and to acknowledge
    the true faith, since 'the just man liveth by faith'; while he is anointed
    between the shoulders, that he may be clothed with the grace of the Holy
    Ghost, lay aside indifference and sloth, and become active in good works; so
    that the sacrament of faith may purify the thoughts of his heart, and
    strengthen his shoulders for the burden of labor." But after Baptism, as
    Rabanus says (De Sacram. iii), "he is forthwith anointed on the head by the
    priest with Holy Chrism, who proceeds at once to offer up a prayer that the
    neophyte may have a share in Christ's kingdom, and be called a Christian
    after Christ." Or, as Ambrose says (De Sacram. iii), his head is anointed,
    because "the senses of a wise man are in his head" (Eccl 2:14): to wit, that
    he may "be ready to satisfy everyone that asketh" him to give "a reason of
    his faith" (cf. 1 Pt. 3:15; Innocent III, Decretal on Holy Unction).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This white garment is given, not as
    though it were unlawful for the neophyte to use others: but as a sign of the
    glorious resurrection, unto which men are born again by Baptism; and in
    order to designate the purity of life, to which he will be bound after being
    baptized, according to Rm. 6:4: "That we may walk in newness of life."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although those things that belong to the
    solemnity of a sacrament are not essential to it, yet are they not
    superfluous, since they pertain to the sacrament's wellbeing, as stated
    above.<br />

    Whether three kinds of Baptism are fittingly described---viz. Baptism of
    Water, of Blood, and of the Spirit?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the three kinds of Baptism are not
    fittingly described as Baptism of Water, of Blood, and of the Spirit, i.e.
    of the Holy Ghost. Because the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++4%3A5"
      >Eph. 4:5</a
    >): "One Faith, one Baptism." Now there is but one Faith. Therefore there
    should not be three Baptisms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Baptism is a sacrament, as we have made
    clear above (<a href="TP065.html#TPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="TP065.html#TPQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now none but Baptism of
    Water is a sacrament. Therefore we should not reckon two other Baptisms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Damascene (De Fide Orth. iv)
    distinguishes several other kinds of Baptism. Therefore we should admit more
    than three Baptisms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> on Heb. 6:2, "Of the doctrine of Baptisms,"
    the gloss says: "He uses the plural, because there is Baptism of Water, of
    Repentance, and of Blood."
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1"
      >Question [62]</a
    >, <a href="TP062.html#TPQ62A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), Baptism of Water has
    its efficacy from Christ's Passion, to which a man is conformed by Baptism,
    and also from the Holy Ghost, as first cause. Now although the effect
    depends on the first cause, the cause far surpasses the effect, nor does it
    depend on it. Consequently, a man may, without Baptism of Water, receive the
    sacramental effect from Christ's Passion, in so far as he is conformed to
    Christ by suffering for Him. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++7%3A14"
      >Apoc. 7:14</a
    >): "These are they who are come out of great tribulation, and have washed
    their robes and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb." In like
    manner a man receives the effect of Baptism by the power of the Holy Ghost,
    not only without Baptism of Water, but also without Baptism of Blood:
    forasmuch as his heart is moved by the Holy Ghost to believe in and love God
    and to repent of his sins: wherefore this is also called Baptism of
    Repentance. Of this it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++4%3A4"
      >Is. 4:4</a
    >): "If the Lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and
    shall wash away the blood of Jerusalem out of the midst thereof, by the
    spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning." Thus, therefore, each of
    these other Baptisms is called Baptism, forasmuch as it takes the place of
    Baptism. Wherefore Augustine says (De Unico Baptismo Parvulorum iv): "The
    Blessed Cyprian argues with considerable reason from the thief to whom,
    though not baptized, it was said: 'Today shalt thou be with Me in Paradise'
    that suffering can take the place of Baptism. Having weighed this in my mind
    again and again, I perceive that not only can suffering for the name of
    Christ supply for what was lacking in Baptism, but even faith and conversion
    of heart, if perchance on account of the stress of the times the celebration
    of the mystery of Baptism is not practicable."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The other two Baptisms are included in
    the Baptism of Water, which derives its efficacy, both from Christ's Passion
    and from the Holy Ghost. Consequently for this reason the unity of Baptism
    is not destroyed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP060.html#TPQ60OUTP1"
      >Question [60]</a
    >, <a href="TP060.html#TPQ60A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), a sacrament is a kind
    of sign. The other two, however, are like the Baptism of Water, not, indeed,
    in the nature of sign, but in the baptismal effect. Consequently they are
    not sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Damascene enumerates certain figurative
    Baptisms. For instance, "the Deluge" was a figure of our Baptism, in respect
    of the salvation of the faithful in the Church; since then "a few... souls
    were saved in the ark [Vulg.: 'by water']," according to 1 Pt. 3:20. He also
    mentions "the crossing of the Red Sea": which was a figure of our Baptism,
    in respect of our delivery from the bondage of sin; hence the Apostle says
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++10%3A2"
      >1 Cor. 10:2</a
    >) that "all... were baptized in the cloud and in the sea." And again he
    mentions "the various washings which were customary under the Old Law,"
    which were figures of our Baptism, as to the cleansing from sins: also "the
    Baptism of John," which prepared the way for our Baptism.<br />

    Whether the Baptism of Blood is the most excellent of these?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the Baptism of Blood is not the
    most excellent of these three. For the Baptism of Water impresses a
    character; which the Baptism of Blood cannot do. Therefore the Baptism of
    Blood is not more excellent than the Baptism of Water.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Baptism of Blood is of no avail
    without the Baptism of the Spirit, which is by charity; for it is written
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++13%3A3"
      >1 Cor. 13:3</a
    >): "If I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it
    profiteth me nothing." But the Baptism of the Spirit avails without the
    Baptism of Blood; for not only the martyrs are saved. Therefore the Baptism
    of Blood is not the most excellent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the Baptism of Water derives its
    efficacy from Christ's Passion, to which, as stated above (<a
      href="TP066.html#TPQ66A11THEP1"
      >Article [11]</a
    >), the Baptism of Blood corresponds, so Christ's Passion derives its
    efficacy from the Holy Ghost, according to Heb. 9:14: "The Blood of Christ,
    Who by the Holy Ghost offered Himself unspotted unto God, shall cleanse our
    conscience from dead works," etc. Therefore the Baptism of the Spirit is
    more excellent than the Baptism of Blood. Therefore the Baptism of Blood is
    not the most excellent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (Ad Fortunatum) speaking of the
    comparison between Baptisms says: "The newly baptized confesses his faith in
    the presence of the priest: the martyr in the presence of the persecutor.
    The former is sprinkled with water, after he has confessed; the latter with
    his blood. The former receives the Holy Ghost by the imposition of the
    bishop's hands; the latter is made the temple of the Holy Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP066.html#TPQ66A11THEP1"
      >Article [11]</a
    >), the shedding of blood for Christ's sake, and the inward operation of the
    Holy Ghost, are called baptisms, in so far as they produce the effect of the
    Baptism of Water. Now the Baptism of Water derives its efficacy from
    Christ's Passion and from the Holy Ghost, as already stated (<a
      href="TP066.html#TPQ66A11THEP1"
      >Article [11]</a
    >). These two causes act in each of these three Baptisms; most excellently,
    however, in the Baptism of Blood. For Christ's Passion acts in the Baptism
    of Water by way of a figurative representation; in the Baptism of the Spirit
    or of Repentance, by way of desire. but in the Baptism of Blood, by way of
    imitating the (Divine) act. In like manner, too, the power of the Holy Ghost
    acts in the Baptism of Water through a certain hidden power. in the Baptism
    of Repentance by moving the heart; but in the Baptism of Blood by the
    highest degree of fervor of dilection and love, according to Jn. 15:13:
    "Greater love than this no man hath that a man lay down his life for his
    friends."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A character is both reality and a
    sacrament. And we do not say that the Baptism of Blood is more excellent,
    considering the nature of a sacrament; but considering the sacramental
    effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The shedding of blood is not in the
    nature of a Baptism if it be without charity. Hence it is clear that the
    Baptism of Blood includes the Baptism of the Spirit, but not conversely. And
    from this it is proved to be more perfect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Baptism owes its pre-eminence not
    only to Christ's Passion, but also to the Holy Ghost, as stated above.<br />
