</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider the death of Christ; concerning which there are 
six subjects of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP050.html#TPQ50A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it was fitting that Christ should die?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP050.html#TPQ50A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether His death severed the union of Godhead and flesh?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP050.html#TPQ50A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether His Godhead was separated from His soul?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP050.html#TPQ50A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether Christ was a man during the three days of His death?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP050.html#TPQ50A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether His was the same body, living and dead?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP050.html#TPQ50A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether His death conduced in any way to our salvation?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not fitting that Christ should die. For 
a first principle in any order is not affected by anything contrary to 
such order: thus fire, which is the principle of heat, can never become 
cold. But the Son of God is the fountain-head and principle of all life, 
according to Ps. 35:10: "With Thee is the fountain of life." Therefore it 
does not seem fitting for Christ to die.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, death is a greater defect than sickness, because it is 
through sickness that one comes to die. But it was not beseeming for 
Christ to languish from sickness, as Chrysostom [*Athanasius, Orat. de 
Incarn. Verbi] says. Consequently, neither was it becoming for Christ to 
die.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++10%3A10">Jn. 10:10</a>): "I am come that  they may 
have life, and may have it more abundantly." But one opposite does not 
lead to another. Therefore it seems that neither was it fitting for 
Christ to die.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written, (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++11%3A50">Jn. 11:50</a>): "It is expedient that one 
man should die for the people . . . that the whole nation perish not": 
which words were spoken prophetically by Caiphas, as the Evangelist 
testifies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It was fitting for Christ to die. First of all to satisfy 
for the whole human race, which was sentenced to die on account of sin, 
according to Gn. 2:17: "In what day soever ye shall [Vulg.: 'thou shalt'] 
eat of it ye shall [Vulg.: 'thou shalt'] die the death." Now it is a 
fitting way of satisfying for another to submit oneself to the penalty 
deserved by that other. And so Christ resolved to die, that by dying He 
might atone for us, according to 1 Pt. 3:18: "Christ also died once for 
our sins." Secondly, in order to show the reality of the flesh assumed. 
For, as Eusebius says (Orat. de Laud. Constant. xv), "if, after dwelling 
among men Christ were suddenly to disappear from men's sight, as though 
shunning death, then by all men He would be likened to a phantom." 
Thirdly, that by dying He might deliver us from fearing death: hence it 
is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++2%3A14,15">Heb. 2:14,15</a>) that He communicated "to flesh and blood, that 
through death He might destroy him who had the empire of death and might 
deliver them who, through the fear of death, were all their lifetime 
subject to servitude." Fourthly, that by dying in the body to the 
likeness of sin---that is, to its penalty---He might set us the example 
of dying to sin spiritually. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++6%3A10">Rm. 6:10</a>): "For in that 
He died to sin, He died once, but in that He liveth, He liveth unto God: 
so do you also reckon that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God." 
Fifthly, that by rising from the dead, and manifesting His power whereby 
He overthrew death, He might instill into us the hope of rising from the 
dead. Hence the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A12">1 Cor. 15:12</a>): "If Christ be preached that 
He rose again from the dead, how do some among you say, that there is no 
resurrection from the dead?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ is the fountain of life, as God, and not as man: but 
He died as man, and not as God. Hence Augustine [*Vigilius Tapsensis] 
says against Felician: "Far be it from us to suppose that Christ so felt 
death that He lost His life inasmuch as He is life in Himself; for, were 
it so, the fountain of life would have run dry. Accordingly, He 
experienced death by sharing in our human feeling, which of His own 
accord He had taken upon Himself, but He did not lose the power of His 
Nature, through which He gives life to all things."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ did not suffer death which comes of sickness, lest 
He should seem to die of necessity from exhausted nature: but He endured 
death inflicted from without, to which He willingly surrendered Himself, 
that His death might be shown to be a voluntary one.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> One opposite does not of itself lead to the  other, yet it 
does so indirectly at times: thus cold sometimes is the indirect cause of 
heat: and in this way Christ by His death brought us back to life, when 
by His death He destroyed our death; just as he who bears another's 
punishment takes such punishment away.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the Godhead was separated from the flesh when Christ died?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Godhead was separated from the flesh when 
Christ died. For as Matthew relates (27:46), when our Lord was hanging 
upon the cross He cried out: "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" 
which words Ambrose, commenting on Lk. 23:46, explains as follows: "The 
man cried out when about to expire by being severed from the Godhead; for 
since the Godhead is immune from death, assuredly death could not be 
there, except life departed, for the Godhead is life." And so it seems 
that when Christ died, the Godhead was separated from His flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, extremes are severed when the mean is removed. But the 
soul was the mean through which the Godhead was united with the flesh, as 
stated above (<A Href="TP006.html#TPQ6OUTP1">Question [6]</a>, <A Href="TP006.html#TPQ6A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore since the soul was severed from the 
flesh by death, it seems that, in consequence, His Godhead was also 
separated from it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God's life-giving power is greater than that of the 
soul. But the body could not die unless the soul quitted it. Therefore, 
much less could it die unless the Godhead departed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP016.html#TPQ16OUTP1">Question [16]</a>, <A Href="TP016.html#TPQ16ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5), the attributes of 
human nature are predicated of the Son of God only by reason of the 
union. But what belongs to the body of Christ after death is predicated 
of the Son of God---namely, being buried: as is evident from the Creed, 
in which it is said that the Son of God "was conceived and born of a 
Virgin, suffered, died, and was buried." Therefore Christ's Godhead was 
not separated from the flesh when He died.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> What is bestowed through God's grace is never withdrawn 
except through fault. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++11%3A29">Rm. 11:29</a>): "The gifts and the 
calling of God are without repentance." But the grace of union whereby 
the Godhead was united to the flesh in Christ's Person, is greater than 
the grace of adoption whereby others are sanctified: also it is more 
enduring of itself, because this grace is ordained for personal union, 
whereas the grace of adoption is referred to a certain affective union. 
And yet we see that the grace of adoption is never lost without fault. 
Since, then there was no sin in Christ, it was impossible for the union 
of the Godhead with the flesh to be dissolved. Consequently, as before 
death Christ's flesh was united personally and hypostatically with the 
Word of God, it remained so after His death, so that the hypostasis of 
the Word of God was not different from that of Christ's flesh after 
death, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Such forsaking is not to be referred to the dissolving of 
the personal union, but to this, that God the Father gave Him up to the 
Passion: hence there "to forsake" means simply not to protect from 
persecutors. or else He says there that He is forsaken, with reference to 
the prayer He had made: "Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass 
away from Me," as Augustine explains it (De Gratia Novi Test.).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Word of God is said to be united with the flesh through 
the medium of the soul, inasmuch as it is through the soul that the flesh 
belongs to human nature, which the Son of God intended to assume; but not 
as though the soul were the medium linking them together. But it is due 
to the soul that the flesh is human even after the soul has been 
separated from it---namely, inasmuch as by God's ordinance there remains 
in the dead flesh a certain relation to the resurrection. And therefore 
the union of the Godhead with the flesh is not taken away.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The soul formally possesses the life-giving energy, and 
therefore, while it is present, and united formally, the body must 
necessarily be a living one, whereas the Godhead has not the life-giving 
energy formally, but effectively; because It cannot be the form of the 
body: and therefore it is not necessary for the flesh to be living while 
the union of the Godhead with the flesh remains, since God does not act 
of necessity, but of His own will.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in Christ's death there was a severance between His Godhead and His soul?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there was a severance in death between 
Christ's Godhead and His soul, because our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++10%3A18">Jn. 10:18</a>): "No man 
taketh away My soul from Me: but I lay it down of Myself, and I have 
power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again." But it does 
not appear that the body can set the soul aside, by separating the soul 
from itself, because the soul is not subject to the power of the body, 
but rather conversely: and so it appears that it belongs to Christ, as 
the Word of God, to lay down His soul: but this is to separate it from 
Himself. Consequently, by death His soul was severed from the Godhead.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Athanasius [*Vigilius Tapsensis, De Trin. vi; 
Bardenhewer assigns it to St. Athanasius: 45, iii. The full title is De 
Trinitate et Spiritu Sancto] says that he "is accursed who does not 
confess that the entire man, whom the Son of God took to Himself, after 
being assumed once more or delivered by Him, rose again from the dead on 
the third day." But the entire man could not be assumed again, unless the 
entire man was at one time separated from the Word of God: and the entire 
man is made of soul and body. Therefore there was a separation made at 
one time of the Godhead from both the body and the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Son of God is truly styled a man because  of the 
union with the entire man. If then, when the union of the soul with the 
body was dissolved by death, the Word of God continued united with the 
soul, it would follow that the Son of God could be truly called a soul. 
But this is false, because since the soul is the form of the body, it 
would result in the Word of God being the form of the body; which is 
impossible. Therefore, in death the soul of Christ was separated from the 
Word of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the separated soul and body are not one hypostasis, but 
two. Therefore, if the Word of God remained united with Christ's soul and 
body, then, when they were severed by Christ's death, it seems to follow 
that the Word of God was two hypostases during such time as Christ was 
dead; which cannot be admitted. Therefore after Christ's death His soul 
did not continue to be united with the Word.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii): "Although Christ 
died as man, and His holy soul was separated from His spotless body, 
nevertheless His Godhead remained unseparated from both---from the soul, 
I mean, and from the body."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The soul is united with the Word of God more immediately 
and more primarily than the body is, because it is through the soul that 
the body is united with the Word of God, as stated above (<A Href="TP006.html#TPQ6OUTP1">Question [6]</a>, <A Href="TP006.html#TPQ6A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
Since, then, the Word of God was not separated from the body at Christ's 
death, much less was He separated from the soul. Accordingly, since what 
regards the body severed from the soul is affirmed of the Son of 
God---namely, that "it was buried"---so is it said of Him in the Creed 
that "He descended into hell," because His soul when separated from the 
body did go down into hell.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine (Tract. xlvii in Joan.), in commenting on the 
text of John, asks, since Christ is Word and soul and body, "whether He 
putteth down His soul, for that He is the Word? Or, for that He is a 
soul?" Or, again, "for that He is flesh?" And he says that, "should we 
say that the Word of God laid down His soul" . . . it would follow that 
"there was a time when that soul was severed from the Word"---which is 
untrue. "For death severed the body and soul . . . but that the soul was 
severed from the Word I do not affirm . . . But should we say that the 
soul laid itself down," it follows "that it is severed from itself: which 
is most absurd." It remains, therefore, that "the flesh itself layeth 
down its soul and taketh it again, not by its own power, but by the power 
of the Word dwelling in the flesh": because, as stated above (<A Href="TP050.html#TPQ50A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the 
Godhead of the Word was not severed from the flesh in death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In those words Athanasius never meant to say that the whole 
man was reassumed---that is, as to all his parts---as if the Word of God 
had laid aside the parts of human nature by His death; but that the 
totality of the assumed nature was restored once more in the resurrection 
by the resumed union of soul and body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Through being united to human nature, the Word of God is 
not on that account called human nature: but He is called a man---that 
is, one having human nature. Now the soul and the body are essential 
parts of human nature. Hence it does not follow that the Word is a soul 
or a body through being united with both, but that He is one possessing a 
soul or a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii): "In Christ's death 
the soul was separated from the flesh: not one hypostasis divided into 
two: because both soul and body in the same respect had their existence 
from the beginning in the hypostasis of the Word; and in death, though 
severed from one another, each one continued to have the one same 
hypostasis of the Word. Wherefore the one hypostasis of the Word was the 
hypostasis of the Word, of the soul, and of the body. For neither soul 
nor body ever had an hypostasis of its own, besides the hypostasis of the 
Word: for there was always one hypostasis of the Word, and never two."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ was a man during the three days of His 
death, because Augustine says (De Trin. iii): "Such was the assuming [of 
nature] as to make God to be man, and man to be God." But this assuming 
[of nature] did not cease at Christ's death. Therefore it seems that He 
did not cease to be a man in consequence of death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. ix) that "each man is his 
intellect"; consequently, when we address the soul of Peter after his 
death we say: "Saint Peter, pray for us." But the Son of God after death 
was not separated from His intellectual soul. Therefore, during those 
three days the Son of God was a man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every priest is a man. But during those three days of 
death Christ was a priest: otherwise what is said in Ps. 109:4 would not 
be true: "Thou art a priest for ever." Therefore Christ was a man during 
those three days.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> When the higher [species] is removed, so is the lower. 
But the living or animated being is a higher species than animal and man, 
because an animal is a sensible animated substance. Now during those 
three days of death Christ's body was not living or animated. Therefore 
He was not a man.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is an article of faith that Christ was truly dead: 
hence it is an error against faith to assert anything whereby the truth 
of Christ's death is destroyed. Accordingly it is said in the Synodal 
epistle of Cyril [*Act. Conc. Ephes. P. I, cap. xxvi]: "If any man does 
not acknowledge that the Word of God suffered in the flesh, and was 
crucified in the flesh and tasted death in the flesh, let him be 
anathema." Now it belongs to the truth of the death of man or animal that 
by death the subject ceases to be man or animal; because the death of the 
man or animal results from the  separation of the soul, which is the 
formal complement of the man or animal. Consequently, to say that Christ 
was a man during the three days of His death simply and without 
qualification, is erroneous. Yet it can be said that He was "a dead man" 
during those three days.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, some writers have contended that Christ was a man during those 
three days, uttering words which are indeed erroneous, yet without intent 
of error in faith: as Hugh of Saint Victor, who (De Sacram. ii) contended 
that Christ, during the three days that followed His death, was a man, 
because he held that the soul is a man: but this is false, as was shown 
in the FP, Question [75], Article [4]. Likewise the Master of the Sentences (iii, D, 22) 
held Christ to be a man during the three days of His death for quite 
another reason. For he believed the union of soul and flesh not to be 
essential to a man, and that for anything to be a man it suffices if it 
have a soul and body, whether united or separated: and that this is 
likewise false is clear both from what has been said in the FP, Question [75], 
Article [4], and from what has been said above regarding the mode of union (<A Href="TP002.html#TPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="TP002.html#TPQ2A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Word of God assumed a united soul and body: and the 
result of this assumption was that God is man, and man is God. But this 
assumption did not cease by the separation of the Word from the soul or 
from the flesh; yet the union of soul and flesh ceased.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man is said to be his own intellect, not because the 
intellect is the entire man, but because the intellect is the chief part 
of man, in which man's whole disposition lies virtually; just as the 
ruler of the city may be called the whole city, since its entire disposal 
is vested in him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That a man is competent to be a priest is by reason of the 
soul, which is the subject of the character of order: hence a man does 
not lose his priestly order by death, and much less does Christ, who is 
the fount of the entire priesthood.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ's was identically the same body living and dead?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's was not identically the same body 
living and dead. For Christ truly died just as other men do. But the body 
of everyone else is not simply identically the same, dead and living, 
because there is an essential difference between them. Therefore neither 
is the body of Christ identically the same, dead and living.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Metaph. v, text. 12), 
things specifically diverse are also numerically diverse. But Christ's 
body, living and dead, was specifically diverse: because the eye or flesh 
of the dead is only called so equivocally, as is evident from the 
Philosopher (De Anima ii, text. 9; Metaph. vii). Therefore Christ's body 
was not simply identically the same, living and dead. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, death is a kind of corruption. But what is corrupted by 
substantial corruption after being corrupted, exists no longer, since 
corruption is change from being to non-being. Therefore, Christ's body, 
after it was dead, did not remain identically the same, because death is 
a substantial corruption.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Athanasius says (Epist. ad Epict.): "In that body which 
was circumcised and carried, which ate, and toiled, and was nailed on the 
tree, there was the impassible and incorporeal Word of God: the same was 
laid in the tomb." But Christ's living body was circumcised and nailed on 
the tree; and Christ's dead body was laid in the tomb. Therefore it was 
the same body living and dead.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The expression "simply" can be taken in two senses. In 
the first instance by taking "simply" to be the same as "absolutely"; 
thus "that is said simply which is said without addition," as the 
Philosopher put it (Topic. ii): and in this way the dead and living body 
of Christ was simply identically the same: since a thing is said to be 
"simply" identically the same from the identity of the subject. But 
Christ's body living and dead was identical in its suppositum because 
alive and dead it had none other besides the Word of God, as was stated 
above (<A Href="TP050.html#TPQ50A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). And it is in this sense that Athanasius is speaking in the 
passage quoted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In another way "simply" is the same as "altogether" or "totally": in 
which sense the body of Christ, dead and alive, was not "simply" the same 
identically, because it was not "totally" the same, since life is of the 
essence of a living body; for it is an essential and not an accidental 
predicate: hence it follows that a body which ceases to be living does 
not remain totally the same. Moreover, if it were to be said that 
Christ's dead body did continue "totally" the same, it would follow that 
it was not corrupted---I mean, by the corruption of death: which is the 
heresy of the Gaianites, as Isidore says (Etym. viii), and is to be found 
in the Decretals (xxiv, qu. iii). And Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii) 
that "the term 'corruption' denotes two things: in one way it is the 
separation of the soul from the body and other things of the sort; in 
another way, the complete dissolving into elements. Consequently it is 
impious to say with Julian and Gaian that the Lord's body was 
incorruptible after the first manner of corruption before the 
resurrection: because Christ's body would not be consubstantial with us, 
nor truly dead, nor would we have been saved in very truth. But in the 
second way Christ's body was incorrupt."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The dead body of everyone else does not continue united to 
an abiding hypostasis, as Christ's dead body did; consequently the dead 
body of everyone else is not the same "simply," but only in some respect: 
because it is the same as to its matter, but not the same as to its form. 
But Christ's body remains the same simply, on account of the identity of 
the suppositum, as stated above. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since a thing is said to be the same identically according 
to suppositum, but the same specifically according to form: wherever the 
suppositum subsists in only one nature, it follows of necessity that when 
the unity of species is taken away the unity of identity is also taken 
away. But the hypostasis of the Word of God subsists in two natures; and 
consequently, although in others the body does not remain the same 
according to the species of human nature, still it continues identically 
the same in Christ according to the suppositum of the Word of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Corruption and death do not belong to Christ by reason of 
the suppositum, from which suppositum follows the unity of identity; but 
by reason of the human nature, according to which is found the difference 
of death and of life in Christ's body.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ's death conduced in any way to our salvation?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's death did not conduce in any way to 
our salvation. For death is a sort of privation, since it is the 
privation of life. But privation has not any power of activity, because 
it is nothing positive. Therefore it could not work anything for our 
salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ's Passion wrought our salvation by way of merit. 
But Christ's death could not operate in this way, because in death the 
body is separated from the soul, which is the principle of meriting. 
Consequently, Christ's death did not accomplish anything towards our 
salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is corporeal is not the cause of what is spiritual. 
But Christ's death was corporeal. Therefore it could not be the cause of 
our salvation, which is something spiritual.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. iv): "The one death of our 
Saviour," namely, that of the body, "saved us from our two deaths," that 
is, of the soul and the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We may speak of Christ's death in two ways, "in becoming" 
and "in fact." Death is said to be "in becoming" when anyone from natural 
or enforced suffering is tending towards death: and in this way it is the 
same thing to speak of Christ's death as of His Passion: so that in this 
sense Christ's death is the cause of our salvation, according to what has 
been already said of the Passion (<A Href="TP048.html#TPQ48OUTP1">Question [48]</a>). But death is considered in 
fact, inasmuch as the separation of soul and body has already taken 
place: and it is in this sense that we are now speaking of Christ's 
death. In this way Christ's death cannot be the cause of our salvation by 
way of merit, but only by way of causality, that is to say, inasmuch as 
the Godhead was not separated from Christ's flesh by death; and 
therefore, whatever befell Christ's flesh, even when the soul was 
departed, was conducive to salvation in virtue of the Godhead united. But 
the effect of any cause is properly estimated according  to its 
resemblance to the cause. Consequently, since death is a kind of 
privation of one's own life, the effect of Christ's death is considered 
in relation to the removal of the obstacles to our salvation: and these 
are the death of the soul and of the body. Hence Christ's death is said 
to have destroyed in us both the death of the soul, caused by sin, 
according to Rm. 4:25: "He was delivered up [namely unto death] for our 
sins": and the death of the body, consisting in the separation of the 
soul, according to 1 Cor. 15:54: "Death is swallowed up in victory."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ's death wrought our salvation from the power of the 
Godhead united, and not consisted merely as His death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Though Christ's death, considered "in fact" did not effect 
our salvation by way of merit, yet it did so by way of causality, as 
stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[50] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ's death was indeed corporeal; but the body was the 
instrument of the Godhead united to Him, working by Its power, although 
dead.<br>
