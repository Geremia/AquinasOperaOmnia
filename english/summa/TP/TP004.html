    OF THE MODE OF UNION ON THE PART OF THE HUMAN NATURE (SIX ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the union on the part of what was assumed. About which
    we must consider first what things were assumed by the Word of God;
    secondly, what were co-assumed, whether perfections or defects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the Son of God assumed human nature and its parts. Hence a threefold
    consideration arises. First, with regard to the nature; secondly, with
    regard to its parts; thirdly, with regard to the order of the assumption.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are six points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP004.html#TPQ4A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether human nature was more
    capable of being assumed than any other nature?<br />
  </p>
  <p><a href="TP004.html#TPQ4A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether He assumed a person?</p>
  <p><a href="TP004.html#TPQ4A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether He assumed a man?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP004.html#TPQ4A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it was becoming that He
    should assume human nature abstracted from all individuals?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP004.html#TPQ4A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether it was becoming that He
    should assume human nature in all its individuals?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP004.html#TPQ4A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether it was becoming that He
    should assume human nature in any man begotten of the stock of Adam?<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether human nature was more assumable by the Son of God than any other
    nature?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that human nature is not more
    capable of being assumed by the Son of God than any other nature. For
    Augustine says (Ep. ad Volusianum cxxxvii): "In deeds wrought miraculously
    the whole reason of the deed is the power of the doer." Now the power of God
    Who wrought the Incarnation, which is a most miraculous work, is not limited
    to one nature, since the power of God is infinite. Therefore human nature is
    not more capable of being assumed than any other creature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, likeness is the foundation of the
    fittingness of the Incarnation of the Divine Person, as above stated (<a
      href="TP003.html#TPQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="TP003.html#TPQ3A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). But as in rational
    creatures we find the likeness of image, so in irrational creatures we find
    the image of trace. Therefore the irrational creature was as capable of
    assumption as human nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the angelic nature we find a more
    perfect likeness than in human nature, as Gregory says: (Hom. de Cent.
    Ovib.; xxxiv in Ev.), where he introduces Ezech. 28:12: "Thou wast the seal
    of resemblance." And sin is found in angels, even as in man, according to
    Job 4:18: "And in His angels He found wickedness." Therefore the angelic
    nature was as capable of assumption as the nature of man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, since the highest perfection belongs to
    God, the more like to God a thing is, the more perfect it is. But the whole
    universe is more perfect than its parts, amongst which is human nature.
    Therefore the whole universe is more capable of being assumed than human
    nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++8%3A31"
      >Prov. 8:31</a
    >) by the mouth of Begotten Wisdom: "My delights were to be with the
    children of men"; and hence there would seem some fitness in the union of
    the Son of God with human nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing is said to be assumable as being
    capable of being assumed by a Divine Person, and this capability cannot be
    taken with reference to the natural passive power, which does not extend to
    what transcends the natural order, as the personal union of a creature with
    God transcends it. Hence it follows that a thing is said to be assumable
    according to some fitness for such a union. Now this fitness in human nature
    may be taken from two things, viz. according to its dignity, and according
    to its need. According to its dignity, because human nature, as being
    rational and intellectual, was made for attaining to the Word to some extent
    by its operation, viz. by knowing and loving Him. According to its
    need---because it stood in need of restoration, having fallen under original
    sin. Now these two things belong to human nature alone. For in the
    irrational creature the fitness of dignity is wanting, and in the angelic
    nature the aforesaid fitness of need is wanting. Hence it follows that only
    human nature was assumable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Creatures are said to be "such" with
    reference to their proper causes, not with reference to what belongs to them
    from their first and universal causes; thus we call a disease incurable, not
    that it cannot be cured by God, but that it cannot be cured by the proper
    principles of the subject. Therefore a creature is said to be not assumable,
    not as if we withdrew anything from the power of God, but in order to show
    the condition of the creature, which has no capability for this.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The likeness of image is found in human
    nature, forasmuch as it is capable of God, viz. by attaining to Him through
    its own operation of knowledge and love. But the likeness of trace regards
    only a representation by Divine impression, existing in the creature, and
    does not imply that the irrational creature, in which such a likeness is,
    can attain to God by its own operation alone. For what does not come up to
    the less, has no fitness for the greater; as a body which is not fitted to
    be perfected by a sensitive soul is much less fitted for an intellectual
    soul. Now much greater and more perfect is the union with God in personal
    being than the union by operation. And hence the irrational creature which
    falls short of the union with God by operation has no fitness to be united
    with Him in personal being.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Some say that angels are not assumable,
    since they are perfect in their personality from the beginning of their
    creation, inasmuch as they are not subject to generation and corruption;
    hence they cannot be assumed to the unity of a Divine Person, unless their
    personality be destroyed, and this does not befit the incorruptibility of
    their nature nor the goodness of the one assuming, to Whom it does not
    belong to corrupt any perfection in the creature assumed. But this would not
    seem totally to disprove the fitness of the angelic nature for being
    assumed. For God by producing a new angelic nature could join it to Himself
    in unity of Person, and in this way nothing pre-existing would be corrupted
    in it. But as was said above, there is wanting the fitness of need, because,
    although the angelic nature in some is the subject of sin, their sin is
    irremediable, as stated above (<a href="../FP.html">FP</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP064.html#FPQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP064.html#FPQ64A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The perfection of the universe is not
    the perfection of one person or suppositum, but of something which is one by
    position or order, whereof very many parts are not capable of assumption, as
    was said above. Hence it follows that only human nature is capable of being
    assumed.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the Son of God assumed a person?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Son of God assumed a
    person. For Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11) that the Son of God
    "assumed human nature 'in atomo,'" i.e. in an individual. But an individual
    in rational nature is a person, as is plain from Boethius (De Duab. Nat.).
    Therefore the Son of God assumed a person.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 6)
    that the Son of God "assumed what He had sown in our nature." But He sowed
    our personality there. Therefore the Son of God assumed a person.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing is absorbed unless it exist. But
    Innocent III [*Paschas. Diac., De Spiritu Sanct. ii] says in a Decretal that
    "the Person of God absorbed the person of man." Therefore it would seem that
    the person of man existed previous to its being assumed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine [*Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad
    Petrum ii) that "God assumed the nature, not the person, of man."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing is said to be assumed inasmuch as it is
    taken into another. Hence, what is assumed must be presupposed to the
    assumption, as what is moved locally is presupposed to the motion. Now a
    person in human nature is not presupposed to assumption; rather, it is the
    term of the assumption, as was said (<a href="TP003.html#TPQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="TP003.html#TPQ3ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). For if it were
    presupposed, it must either have been corrupted---in which case it was
    useless; or it remains after the union---and thus there would be two
    persons, one assuming and the other assumed, which is false, as was shown
    above (<a href="TP002.html#TPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>,
    <a href="TP002.html#TPQ2A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Hence it follows that the
    Son of God nowise assumed a human person.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Son of God assumed human nature "in
    atomo," i.e. in an individual, which is no other than the uncreated
    suppositum, the Person of the Son of God. Hence it does not follow that a
    person was assumed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Its proper personality is not wanting to
    the nature assumed through the loss of anything pertaining to the perfection
    of the human nature but through the addition of something which is above
    human nature, viz. the union with a Divine Person.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Absorption does not here imply the
    destruction of anything pre-existing, but the hindering what might otherwise
    have been. For if the human nature had not been assumed by a Divine Person,
    the human nature would have had its own personality; and in this way is it
    said, although improperly, that the Person "absorbed the person," inasmuch
    as the Divine Person by His union hindered the human nature from having its
    personality.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the Divine Person assumed a man?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Divine Person assumed a
    man. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++64%3A5"
      >Ps. 64:5</a
    >): "Blessed is he whom Thou hast chosen and taken to Thee," which a gloss
    expounds of Christ; and Augustine says (De Agone Christ. xi): "The Son of
    God assumed a man, and in him bore things human."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the word "man" signifies a human nature.
    But the Son of God assumed a human nature. Therefore He assumed a man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Son of God is a man. But He is not
    one of the men He did not assume, for with equal reason He would be Peter or
    any other man. Therefore He is the man whom He assumed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Is the authority of Felix, Pope and Martyr,
    which is quoted by the Council of Ephesus: "We believe in our Lord Jesus
    Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, because He is the Eternal Son and Word of
    God, and not a man assumed by God, in such sort that there is another
    besides Him. For the Son of God did not assume a man, so that there be
    another besides Him."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As has been said above (<a
      href="TP004.html#TPQ4A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), what is assumed is not the term of the assumption, but is presupposed to
    the assumption. Now it was said (<a href="TP003.html#TPQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="TP003.html#TPQ3ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2) that the individual
    to Whom the human nature is assumed is none other than the Divine Person,
    Who is the term of the assumption. Now this word "man" signifies human
    nature, as it is in a suppositum, because, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth.
    iii, 4,11), this word God signifies Him Who has human nature. And hence it
    cannot properly be said that the Son assumed a man, granted (as it must be,
    in fact) that in Christ there is but one suppositum and one hypostasis. But
    according to such as hold that there are two hypostases or two supposita in
    Christ, it may fittingly and properly be said that the Son of God assumed a
    man. Hence the first opinion quoted in Sent. iii, D. 6, grants that a man
    was assumed. But this opinion is erroneous, as was said above (<a
      href="TP002.html#TPQ2OUTP1"
      >Question [2]</a
    >, <a href="TP002.html#TPQ2A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These phrases are not to be taken too
    literally, but are to be loyally explained, wherever they are used by holy
    doctors; so as to say that a man was assumed, inasmuch as his nature was
    assumed; and because the assumption terminated in this---that the Son of God
    is man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The word "man" signifies human nature in
    the concrete, inasmuch as it is in a suppositum; and hence, since we cannot
    say a suppositum was assumed, so we cannot say a man was assumed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Son of God is not the man whom He
    assumed, but the man whose nature He assumed.<br />

    Whether the Son of God ought to have assumed human nature abstracted from
    all individuals?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Son of God ought to have
    assumed human nature abstracted from all individuals. For the assumption of
    human nature took place for the common salvation of all men; hence it is
    said of Christ (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++4%3A10"
      >1 Tim. 4:10</a
    >) that He is "the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful." But
    nature as it is in individuals withdraws from its universality. Therefore
    the Son of God ought to have assumed human nature as it is abstracted from
    all individuals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what is noblest in all things ought to
    be attributed to God. But in every genus what is of itself is best.
    Therefore the Son of God ought to have assumed self-existing [per se] man,
    which, according to Platonists, is human nature abstracted from its
    individuals. Therefore the Son of God ought to have assumed this.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, human nature was not assumed by the Son
    of God in the concrete as is signified by the word "man," as was said above
    (<a href="TP004.html#TPQ4A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Now in this way it
    signifies human nature as it is in individuals, as is plain from what has
    been said (<a href="TP004.html#TPQ4A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore the
    Son of God assumed human nature as it is separated from individuals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11): "God
    the Word Incarnate did not assume a nature which exists in pure thought; for
    this would have been no Incarnation, but a false and fictitious
    Incarnation." But human nature as it is separated or abstracted from
    individuals is "taken to be a pure conception, since it does not exist in
    itself," as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11). Therefore the Son of God
    did not assume human nature, as it is separated from individuals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The nature of man or of any other sensible
    thing, beyond the being which it has in individuals, may be taken in two
    ways: first, as if it had being of itself, away from matter, as the
    Platonists held; secondly, as existing in an intellect either human or
    Divine. Now it cannot subsist of itself, as the Philosopher proves (Metaph.
    vii, 26,27,29,51), because sensible matter belongs to the specific nature of
    sensible things, and is placed in its definition, as flesh and bones in the
    definition of man. Hence human nature cannot be without sensible matter.
    Nevertheless, if human nature were subsistent in this way, it would not be
    fitting that it should be assumed by the Word of God. First, because this
    assumption is terminated in a Person, and it is contrary to the nature of a
    common form to be thus individualized in a person. Secondly, because to a
    common nature can only be attributed common and universal operations,
    according to which man neither merits nor demerits, whereas, on the
    contrary, the assumption took place in order that the Son of God, having
    assumed our nature, might merit for us. Thirdly, because a nature so
    existing would not be sensible, but intelligible. But the Son of God assumed
    human nature in order to show Himself in men's sight, according to Baruch
    3:38: "Afterwards He was seen upon earth, and conversed with men."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, neither could human nature have been assumed by the Son of God, as
    it is in the Divine intellect, since it would be none other than the Divine
    Nature; and, according to this, human nature would be in the Son of God from
    eternity. Neither can we say that the Son of God assumed human nature as it
    is in a human intellect, for this would mean nothing else but that He is
    understood to assume a human nature; and thus if He did not assume it in
    reality, this would be a false understanding; nor would this assumption of
    the human nature be anything but a fictitious Incarnation, as Damascene says
    (De Fide Orth. iii, 11).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The incarnate Son of God is the common
    Saviour of all, not by a generic or specific community, such as is
    attributed to the nature separated from the individuals, but by a community
    of cause, whereby the incarnate Son of God is the universal cause of human
    salvation.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Self-existing [per se] man is not to be
    found in nature in such a way as to be outside the singular, as the
    Platonists held, although some say Plato believed that the separate man was
    only in the Divine intellect. And hence it was not necessary for it to be
    assumed by the Word, since it had been with Him from eternity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although human nature was not assumed in
    the concrete, as if the suppositum were presupposed to the assumption,
    nevertheless it is assumed in an individual, since it is assumed so as to be
    in an individual.<br />

    Whether the Son of God ought to have assumed human nature in all
    individuals?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Son of God ought to have
    assumed human nature in all individuals. For what is assumed first and by
    itself is human nature. But what belongs essentially to a nature belongs to
    all who exist in the nature. Therefore it was fitting that human nature
    should be assumed by the Word of God in all its supposita.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Divine Incarnation proceeded from
    Divine Love; hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A16"
      >Jn. 3:16</a
    >): "God so loved the world as to give His only-begotten Son." But love
    makes us give ourselves to our friends as much as we can, and it was
    possible for the Son of God to assume several human natures, as was said
    above (<a href="TP003.html#TPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="TP003.html#TPQ3A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), and with equal reason
    all. Hence it was fitting for the Son of God to assume human nature in all
    its supposita.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a skilful workman completes his work in
    the shortest manner possible. But it would have been a shorter way if all
    men had been assumed to the natural sonship than for one natural Son to lead
    many to the adoption of sons, as is written Gal. 4:5 (cf. Heb. 2:10).
    Therefore human nature ought to have been assumed by God in all its
    supposita.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 11) that
    the Son of God "did not assume human nature as a species, nor did He assume
    all its hypostases."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was unfitting for human nature to be assumed
    by the Word in all its supposita. First, because the multitude of supposita
    of human nature, which are natural to it, would have been taken away. For
    since we must not see any other suppositum in the assumed nature, except the
    Person assuming, as was said above (<a href="TP004.html#TPQ4A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), if there was no human nature except what was assumed, it would follow
    that there was but one suppositum of human nature, which is the Person
    assuming. Secondly, because this would have been derogatory to the dignity
    of the incarnate Son of God, as He is the First-born of many brethren,
    according to the human nature, even as He is the First-born of all creatures
    according to the Divine, for then all men would be of equal dignity.
    Thirdly, because it is fitting that as one Divine suppositum is incarnate,
    so He should assume one human nature, so that on both sides unity might be
    found.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To be assumed belongs to the human
    nature of itself, because it does not belong to it by reason of a person, as
    it belongs to the Divine Nature to assume by reason of the Person; not,
    however, that it belongs to it of itself as if belonging to its essential
    principles, or as its natural property in which manner it would belong to
    all its supposita.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The love of God to men is shown not
    merely in the assumption of human nature, but especially in what He suffered
    in human nature for other men, according to Rm. 5:8: "But God commendeth His
    charity towards us; because when as yet we were sinners... Christ died for
    us," which would not have taken place had He assumed human nature in all its
    supposita.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In order to shorten the way, which every
    skilful workman does, what can be done by one must not be done by many.
    Hence it was most fitting that by one man all the rest should be saved.<br />

    Whether it was fitting for the Son of God to assume human nature of the
    stock of Adam?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not fitting for the Son
    of God to assume human nature of the stock of Adam, for the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++7%3A26"
      >Heb. 7:26</a
    >): "For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest... separated
    from sinners." But He would have been still further separated from sinners
    had He not assumed human nature of the stock of Adam, a sinner. Hence it
    seems that He ought not to have assumed human nature of the stock of
    Adam.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in every genus the principle is nobler
    than what is from the principle. Hence, if He wished to assume human nature,
    He ought to have assumed it in Adam himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Gentiles were greater sinners than
    the Jews, as a gloss says on Gal. 2:15: "For we by nature are Jews, and not
    of the Gentiles, sinners." Hence, if He wished to assume human nature from
    sinners, He ought rather to have assumed it from the Gentiles than from the
    stock of Abraham, who was just.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++3"
      >Lk. 3</a
    >), the genealogy of our Lord is traced back to Adam.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 18): "God was
    able to assume human nature elsewhere than from the stock of Adam, who by
    his sin had fettered the whole human race; yet God judged it better to
    assume human nature from the vanquished race, and thus to vanquish the enemy
    of the human race." And this for three reasons: First, because it would seem
    to belong to justice that he who sinned should make amends; and hence that
    from the nature which he had corrupted should be assumed that whereby
    satisfaction was to be made for the whole nature. Secondly, it pertains to
    man's greater dignity that the conqueror of the devil should spring from the
    stock conquered by the devil. Thirdly, because God's power is thereby made
    more manifest, since, from a corrupt and weakened nature, He assumed that
    which was raised to such might and glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ ought to be separated from
    sinners as regards sin, which He came to overthrow, and not as regards
    nature which He came to save, and in which "it behooved Him in all things to
    be made like to His brethren," as the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++2%3A17"
      >Heb. 2:17</a
    >). And in this is His innocence the more wonderful, seeing that though
    assumed from a mass tainted by sin, His nature was endowed with such
    purity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As was said above (ad 1) it behooved Him
    Who came to take away sins to be separated from sinners as regards sin, to
    which Adam was subject, whom Christ "brought out of his sin," as is written
    (Wis. 10:2). For it behooved Him Who came to cleanse all, not to need
    cleansing Himself; just as in every genus of motion the first mover is
    immovable as regards that motion, and the first to alter is itself
    unalterable. Hence it was not fitting that He should assume human nature in
    Adam himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since Christ ought especially to be
    separated from sinners as regards sin, and to possess the highest innocence,
    it was fitting that between the first sinner and Christ some just men should
    stand midway, in whom certain forecasts of (His) future holiness should
    shine forth. And hence, even in the people from whom Christ was to be born,
    God appointed signs of holiness, which began in Abraham, who was the first
    to receive the promise of Christ, and circumcision, as a sign that the
    covenant should be kept, as is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++17%3A11"
      >Gn. 17:11</a
    >).<br />
