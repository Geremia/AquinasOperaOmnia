    Whether Christ should have been born of an espoused virgin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ should not have been
    born of an espoused virgin. For espousals are ordered to carnal intercourse.
    But our Lord's Mother never wished to have carnal intercourse with her
    husband; because this would be derogatory to the virginity of her mind.
    Therefore she should not have been espoused.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that Christ was born of a virgin was
    miraculous, whence Augustine says (Ep. ad Volus. cxxxvii): "This same power
    of God brought forth the infant's limbs out of the virginal womb of His
    inviolate Mother, by which in the vigor of manhood He passed through the
    closed doors. If we are told why this happened, it will cease to be
    wonderful; if another instance be alleged, it will no longer be unique." But
    miracles that are wrought in confirmation of the Faith should be manifest.
    Since, therefore, by her Espousals this miracle would be less evident, it
    seems that it was unfitting that Christ should be born of an espoused
    virgin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the martyr Ignatius, as Jerome says on
    Mt. 1:18, gives as a reason of the espousals of the Mother of God, "that the
    manner of His Birth might be hidden from the devil, who would think Him to
    be begotten not of a virgin but of a wife." But this seems to be no reason
    at all. First, because by his natural cunning he knows whatever takes place
    in bodies. Secondly, because later on the demons, through many evident
    signs, knew Christ after a fashion: whence it is written (Mk. 1:23,24): "A
    man with an unclean spirit... cried out, saying: What have we to do with
    Thee, Jesus of Nazareth? Art Thou come to destroy us? I know... Thou art the
    Holy one of God." Therefore it does not seem fitting that the Mother of God
    should have been espoused.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Jerome gives as another reason, "lest
    the Mother of God should be stoned by the Jews as an adulteress." But this
    reason seems to have no weight, for if she were not espoused, she could not
    be condemned for adultery. Therefore it does not seem reasonable that Christ
    should be born of an espoused virgin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++1%3A18"
      >Mt. 1:18</a
    >): "When as His Mother Mary was espoused to Joseph": and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++1%3A26,27"
      >Lk. 1:26,27</a
    >): "The angel Gabriel was sent... to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
    was Joseph."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was fitting that Christ should be born of an
    espoused virgin; first, for His own sake; secondly, for His Mother's sake;
    thirdly, for our sake. For the sake of Christ Himself, for four reasons.
    First, lest He should be rejected by unbelievers as illegitimate: wherefore
    Ambrose says on Lk. 1:26,27: "How could we blame Herod or the Jews if they
    seem to persecute one who was born of adultery?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, in order that in the customary way His genealogy might be traced
    through the male line. Thus Ambrose says on Lk. 3:23: "He Who came into the
    world, according to the custom of the world had to be enrolled Now for this
    purpose, it is the men that are required, because they represent the family
    in the senate and other courts. The custom of the Scriptures, too, shows
    that the ancestry of the men is always traced out."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, for the safety of the new-born Child: lest the devil should plot
    serious hurt against Him. Hence Ignatius says that she was espoused "that
    the manner of His Birth might be hidden from the devil."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Fourthly, that He might be fostered by Joseph: who is therefore called His
    "father," as bread-winner.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It was also fitting for the sake of the Virgin. First, because thus she was
    rendered exempt from punishment; that is, "lest she should be stoned by the
    Jews as an adulteress," as Jerome says.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, that thus she might be safeguarded from ill fame. Whence Ambrose
    says on Lk. 1:26,27: "She was espoused lest she be wounded by the ill-fame
    of violated virginity, in whom the pregnant womb would betoken
    corruption."<br />
  </p>
  <p>Thirdly, that, as Jerome says, Joseph might administer to her wants.</p>
  <p>
    This was fitting, again, for our sake. First, because Joseph is thus a
    witness to Christ's being born of a virgin. Wherefore Ambrose says: "Her
    husband is the more trustworthy witness of her purity, in that he would
    deplore the dishonor, and avenge the disgrace, were it not that he
    acknowledged the mystery."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, because thereby the very words of the Virgin are rendered more
    credible by which she asserted her virginity. Thus Ambrose says: "Belief in
    Mary's words is strengthened, the motive for a lie is removed. If she had
    not been espoused when pregnant, she would seem to have wished to hide her
    sin by a lie: being espoused, she had no motive for lying, since a woman's
    pregnancy is the reward of marriage and gives grace to the nuptial bond."
    These two reasons add strength to our faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, that all excuse be removed from those virgins who, through want of
    caution, fall into dishonor. Hence Ambrose says: "It was not becoming that
    virgins should expose themselves to evil report, and cover themselves with
    the excuse that the Mother of the Lord had also been oppressed by
    ill-fame."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Fourthly, because by this the universal Church is typified, which is a
    virgin and yet is espoused to one Man, Christ, as Augustine says (De Sanct.
    Virg. xii).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    A fifth reason may be added: since the Mother of the Lord being both
    espoused and a virgin, both virginity and wedlock are honored in her person,
    in contradiction to those heretics who disparaged one or the other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We must believe that the Blessed Virgin,
    Mother of God, desired, from an intimate inspiration of the Holy Ghost, to
    be espoused, being confident that by the help of God she would never come to
    have carnal intercourse: yet she left this to God's discretion. Wherefore
    she suffered nothing in detriment to her virginity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Ambrose says on Lk. 1:26: "Our Lord
    preferred that men should doubt of His origin rather than of His Mother's
    purity. For he knew the delicacy of virgin modesty, and how easily the fair
    name of chastity is disparaged: nor did He choose that our faith in His
    Birth should be strengthened in detriment to His Mother." We must observe,
    however, that some miracles wrought by God are the direct object of faith;
    such are the miracles of the virginal Birth, the Resurrection of our Lord,
    and the Sacrament of the Altar. Wherefore our Lord wished these to be more
    hidden, that belief in them might have greater merit. Whereas other miracles
    are for the strengthening of faith: and these it behooves to be manifest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Trin. iii), the
    devil can do many things by his natural power which he is hindered by the
    Divine power from doing. Thus it may be that by his natural power the devil
    could know that the Mother of God knew not man, but was a virgin; yet was
    prevented by God from knowing the manner of the Divine Birth. That
    afterwards the devil after a fashion knew that He was the Son of God, makes
    no difficulty: because then the time had already come for Christ to make
    known His power against the devil, and to suffer persecution aroused by him.
    But during His infancy it behooved the malice of the devil to be withheld,
    lest he should persecute Him too severely: for Christ did not wish to suffer
    such things then, nor to make His power known, but to show Himself to be in
    all things like other infants. Hence Pope Leo (Serm. in Epiph. iv) says that
    "the Magi found the Child Jesus small in body, dependent on others, unable
    to speak, and in no way differing from the generality of human infants."
    Ambrose, however, expounding Lk. 1:26, seems to understand this of the
    devil's members. For, after giving the above reason---namely, that the
    prince of the world might be deceived---he continues thus: "Yet still more
    did He deceive the princes of the world, since the evil disposition of the
    demons easily discovers even hidden things: but those who spend their lives
    in worldly vanities can have no acquaintance of Divine things."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The sentence of adulteresses according
    to the Law was that they should be stoned, not only if they were already
    espoused or married, but also if their maidenhood were still under the
    protection of the paternal roof, until the day when they enter the married
    state. Thus it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++22%3A20,21"
      >Dt. 22:20,21</a
    >): "If... virginity be not found in the damsel... the men of the city shall
    stone her to death, and she shall die; because she hath done a wicked thing
    in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It may also be said, according to some writers, that the Blessed Virgin was
    of the family or kindred of Aaron, so that she was related to Elizabeth, as
    we are told (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++1%3A36"
      >Lk. 1:36</a
    >). Now a virgin of the priestly tribe was condemned to death for whoredom;
    for we read (Lev. 21:9): "If the daughter of a priest be taken in whoredom,
    and dishonor the name of her father, she shall be burnt with fire."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, some understand the passage of Jerome to refer to the throwing of
    stones by ill-fame.<br />

    Whether there was a true marriage between Mary and Joseph?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there was no true marriage
    between Mary and Joseph. For Jerome says against Helvidius that Joseph "was
    Mary's guardian rather than her husband." But if this was a true marriage,
    Joseph was truly her husband. Therefore there was no true marriage between
    Mary and Joseph.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, on Mt. 1:16: "Jacob begot Joseph the
    husband of Mary," Jerome says: "When thou readest 'husband' suspect not a
    marriage; but remember that Scripture is wont to speak of those who are
    betrothed as husband and wife." But a true marriage is not effected by the
    betrothal, but by the wedding. Therefore, there was no true marriage between
    the Blessed Virgin and Joseph.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++1%3A19"
      >Mt. 1:19</a
    >): "Joseph, her husband, being a just man, and not willing to take her away
    [*Douay: 'publicly to expose her'], i.e. to take her to his home in order to
    cohabit with her, was minded to put her away privately, i.e. to postpone the
    wedding," as Remigius [*Cf. Catena Aurea in Matth.] expounds. Therefore, it
    seems that, as the wedding was not yet solemnized, there was no true
    marriage: especially since, after the marriage contract, no one can lawfully
    put his wife away.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Consensu Evang. ii): "It
    cannot be allowed that the evangelist thought that Joseph ought to sever his
    union with Mary" (since he said that Joseph was Mary's husband) "on the
    ground that in giving birth to Christ, she had not conceived of him, but
    remained a virgin. For by this example the faithful are taught that if after
    marriage they remain continent by mutual consent, their union is still and
    is rightly called marriage, even without intercourse of the sexes."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Marriage or wedlock is said to be true by
    reason of its attaining its perfection. Now perfection of anything is
    twofold; first, and second. The first perfection of a thing consists in its
    very form, from which it receives its species; while the second perfection
    of a thing consists in its operation, by which in some way a thing attains
    its end. Now the form of matrimony consists in a certain inseparable union
    of souls, by which husband and wife are pledged by a bond of mutual
    affection that cannot be sundered. And the end of matrimony is the begetting
    and upbringing of children: the first of which is attained by conjugal
    intercourse; the second by the other duties of husband and wife, by which
    they help one another in rearing their offspring.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus we may say, as to the first perfection, that the marriage of the Virgin
    Mother of God and Joseph was absolutely true: because both consented to the
    nuptial bond, but not expressly to the bond of the flesh, save on the
    condition that it was pleasing to God. For this reason the angel calls Mary
    the wife of Joseph, saying to him (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++1%3A20"
      >Mt. 1:20</a
    >): "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife": on which words Augustine
    says (De Nup. et Concup. i): "She is called his wife from the first promise
    of her espousals, whom he had not known nor ever was to know by carnal
    intercourse."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But as to the second perfection which is attained by the marriage act, if
    this be referred to carnal intercourse, by which children are begotten; thus
    this marriage was not consummated. Wherefore Ambrose says on Lk. 1:26,27:
    "Be not surprised that Scripture calls Mary a wife. The fact of her marriage
    is declared, not to insinuate the loss of virginity, but to witness to the
    reality of the union." Nevertheless, this marriage had the second
    perfection, as to upbringing of the child. Thus Augustine says (De Nup. et
    Concup. i): "All the nuptial blessings are fulfilled in the marriage of
    Christ's parents, offspring, faith and sacrament. The offspring we know to
    have been the Lord Jesus; faith, for there was no adultery: sacrament, since
    there was no divorce. Carnal intercourse alone there was none."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Jerome uses the term "husband" in
    reference to marriage consummated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By marriage Jerome means the nuptial
    intercourse.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Chrysostom says (Hom. i super Matth.
    [*Opus Imperfectum among the supposititious works ascribed to St.
    Chrysostom]) the Blessed Virgin was so espoused to Joseph that she dwelt in
    his home: "for just as she who conceives in her husband's house is
    understood to have conceived of him, so she who conceives elsewhere is
    suspect." Consequently sufficient precaution would not have been taken to
    safeguard the fair fame of the Blessed Virgin, if she had not the entry of
    her husband's house. Wherefore the words, "not willing to take her away" are
    better rendered as meaning, "not willing publicly to expose her," than
    understood of taking her to his house. Hence the evangelist adds that "he
    was minded to put her away privately." But although she had the entry of
    Joseph's house by reason of her first promise of espousals, yet the time had
    not yet come for the solemnizing of the wedding; for which reason they had
    not yet consummated the marriage. Therefore, as Chrysostom says (Hom. iv in
    Matth.): "The evangelist does not say, 'before she was taken to the house of
    her husband,' because she was already in the house. For it was the custom
    among the ancients for espoused maidens to enter frequently the houses of
    them to whom they were betrothed." Therefore the angel also said to Joseph:
    "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife"; that is: "Fear not to solemnize
    your marriage with her." Others, however, say that she was not yet admitted
    to his house, but only betrothed to him. But the first is more in keeping
    with the Gospel narrative.<br />
