<H3 Align="Center">OF CHRIST'S SUBJECTION TO THE FATHER (TWO ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider such things as belong to Christ in relation to the 
Father. Some of these things are predicated of Him because of His 
relation to the Father, e.g. that He was subject to Him, that He prayed 
to Him, that He ministered, to Him by priesthood. And some are 
predicated, or may be predicated, of Him because of the Father's relation 
to Him, e.g. that the Father adopted Him and that He predestined Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] Out. Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence we must consider (1) Christ's subjection to the Father; (2) His 
prayer; (3) His priesthood; (4) Adoption---whether it is becoming to Him; 
(5) His predestination.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] Out. Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are two points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP020.html#TPQ20A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Christ is subject to the Father?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP020.html#TPQ20A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether He is subject to Himself?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we may not say that Christ was subject to the 
Father. For everything subject to the Father is a creature, since, as is 
said in De Eccles. Dogm. iv, "in the Trinity there is no dependence or 
subjection." But we cannot say simply that Christ is a creature, as was 
stated above (<A Href="TP016.html#TPQ16OUTP1">Question [16]</a>, <A Href="TP016.html#TPQ16A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Therefore we cannot say simply that Christ is 
subject to God the Father.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a thing is said to be subject to God when it is 
subservient to His dominion. But we cannot attribute subservience to the 
human nature of Christ; for Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 21): "We 
must bear in mind that we may not call it" (i.e. Christ's human nature) 
"a servant; for the words 'subservience' and 'domination' are not names 
of the nature, but of relations, as the words 'paternity' and 
'filiation.'" Hence Christ in His human nature is not subject to God the 
Father.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A28">1 Cor. 15:28</a>): "And when all things shall 
be subdued unto Him, then the Son also Himself shall be subject unto Him 
that put all things under Him." But, as is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++2%3A8">Heb. 2:8</a>): "We see 
not as yet all things subject to Him." Hence He is not yet subject to the 
Father, Who has subjected all things to Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++14%3A28">Jn. 14:28</a>), "The Father is greater than 
I"; and Augustine says (De Trin. i, 7): "It is not without reason that 
the Scripture mentions both, that the Son is equal to the Father and the 
Father greater than the Son, for the first is said on account of the form 
of God, and the second on account of the form of a servant, without any 
confusion." Now the less is subject to the greater. Therefore in the form 
of a servant Christ is subject to the Father.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Whoever has a nature is competent to have what is proper 
to that nature. Now human nature from its beginning has a threefold 
subjection to God. The first regards the degree of goodness, inasmuch as 
the Divine Nature is the very essence of goodness as is clear from 
Dionysius (Div. Nom. i) while a created nature has a participation of the 
Divine goodness, being subject, so to say, to the rays of this goodness. 
Secondly, human nature is subject to God, as regards God's power, 
inasmuch as human nature, even as every creature, is subject to the 
operation of the Divine ordinance. Thirdly, human nature is especially 
subject to God through its proper act, inasmuch as by its own will it 
obeys His command. This triple subjection to God Christ professes of 
Himself. The first (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++19%3A17">Mt. 19:17</a>): "Why askest thou Me concerning good? One 
is good, God." And on this Jerome remarks: "He who had called Him a good 
master, and had not confessed Him to be God or the Son of God, learns 
that no man, however holy, is good in comparison with God." And hereby He 
gave us to understand that He Himself, in His human nature, did not 
attain to the height of Divine goodness. And because "in such things as 
are great, but not in bulk, to be great is the same as to be good," as 
Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 8), for this reason the Father is said to be 
greater than Christ in His human nature. The second subjection is 
attributed to Christ, inasmuch as all that befell Christ is believed to 
have happened by Divine appointment; hence Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. 
iv) that Christ "is subject to the ordinance of God the Father." And this 
is the subjection of subservience, whereby "every creature serves God" 
(Judith 16:17), being subject to His ordinance, according to Wis. 16:24: 
"The creature serving Thee the Creator." And in this way the Son of God 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++2%3A7">Phil. 2:7</a>) is said to have taken "the form of a servant." The third 
subjection He attributes to Himself, saying (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++8%3A29">Jn. 8:29</a>): "I do always the 
things that please Him." And this is the subjection to the Father, of 
obedience unto death. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++2%3A8">Phil. 2:8</a>) that he became 
"obedient" to the Father "unto death."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As we are not to understand that Christ is a creature 
simply, but only in His human nature, whether this qualification be added 
or not, as stated above (<A Href="TP016.html#TPQ16OUTP1">Question [16]</a>, <A Href="TP016.html#TPQ16A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>), so also  we are to understand that 
Christ is subject to the Father not simply but in His human nature, even 
if this qualification be not added; and yet it is better to add this 
qualification in order to avoid the error of Arius, who held the Son to 
be less than the Father.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The relation of subservience and dominion is based upon 
action and passion, inasmuch as it belongs to a servant to be moved by 
the will of his master. Now to act is not attributed to the nature as 
agent, but to the person, since "acts belong to supposita and to 
singulars," according to the Philosopher (Metaph. i, 1). Nevertheless 
action is attributed to the nature as to that whereby the person or 
hypostasis acts. Hence, although the nature is not properly said to rule 
or serve, yet every hypostasis or person may be properly said to be 
ruling or serving in this or that nature. And in this way nothing 
prevents Christ being subject or servant to the Father in human nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Trin. i, 8): "Christ will give the 
kingdom to God and the Father, when He has brought the faithful, over 
whom He now reigns by faith, to the vision," i.e. to see the essence 
common to the Father and the Son: and then He will be totally subject to 
the Father not only in Himself, but also in His members by the full 
participation of the Godhead. And then all things will be fully subject 
to Him by the final accomplishment of His will concerning them; although 
even now all things are subject to Him as regards His power, according to 
Mt. 28:18: "All power is given to Me in heaven and in earth."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ is not subject to Himself. For Cyril 
says in a synodal letter which the Council of Ephesus (Part I, ch. xxvi) 
received: "Christ is neither servant nor master of Himself. It is 
foolish, or rather impious, to think or say this." And Damascene says the 
same (De Fide Orth. iii, 21): "The one Being, Christ, cannot be the 
servant or master of Himself." Now Christ is said to be the servant of 
the Father inasmuch as He is subject to Him. Hence Christ is not subject 
to Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, servant has reference to master. Now nothing has a 
relation to itself, hence Hilary says (De Trin. vii) that nothing is like 
or equal to itself. Hence Christ cannot be said to be the servant of 
Himself, and consequently to be subject to Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "as the rational soul and flesh are one man; so God and 
man are one Christ," as Athanasius says (Symb. Fid.). Now man is not said 
to be subject to himself or servant to himself or greater than himself 
because his body is subject to his soul. Therefore, Christ is not said to 
be subject to Himself because His Manhood is subject to His Godhead.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[2] OTC Para. 1/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. i, 7): "Truth shows in this 
way" (i.e. whereby the Father is greater than Christ in human nature) 
"that the Son is less than Himself."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[2] OTC Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, as he argues (De Trin. i, 7), the form of a servant was so 
taken by the Son of God that the form of God was not lost. But because of 
the form of God, which is common to the Father and the Son, the Father is 
greater than the Son in human nature. Therefore the Son is greater than 
Himself in human nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[2] OTC Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, Christ in His human nature is the servant of God the Father, 
according to Jn. 20:17: "I ascend to My Father and to your Father to My 
God and your God." Now whoever is the servant of the Father is the 
servant of the Son; otherwise not everything that belongs to the Father 
would belong to the Son. Therefore Christ is His own servant and is 
subject to Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was said above (<A Href="TP020.html#TPQ20A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), to be master or servant 
is attributed to a person or hypostasis according to a nature. Hence when 
it is said that Christ is the master or servant of Himself, or that the 
Word of God is the Master of the Man Christ, this may be understood in 
two ways. First, so that this is understood to be said by reason of 
another hypostasis or person, as if there was the person of the Word of 
God ruling and the person of the man serving; and this is the heresy of 
Nestorius. Hence in the condemnation of Nestorius it is said in the 
Council of Ephesus (Part III, ch. i, anath. 6): "If anyone say that the 
Word begotten of God the Father is the God or Lord of Christ, and does 
not rather confess the same to be at once God and man as the Word made 
flesh, according to the Scriptures, let him be anathema." And in this 
sense it is denied by Cyril and Damascene (Objection [1]); and in the same sense 
must it be denied that Christ is less than Himself or subject to Himself. 
Secondly, it may be understood of the diversity of natures in the one 
person or hypostasis. And thus we may say that in one of them, in which 
He agrees with the Father, He presides and rules together with the 
Father; and in the other nature, in which He agrees with us, He is 
subject and serves, and in this sense Augustine says that "the Son is 
less than Himself."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet it must be borne in mind that since this name "Christ" is the name 
of a Person, even as the name "Son," those things can be predicated 
essentially and absolutely of Christ which belong to Him by reason of the 
Person, Which is eternal; and especially those relations which seem more 
properly to pertain to the Person or the hypostasis. But whatever 
pertains to Him in His human nature is rather to be attributed to Him 
with a qualification; so that we say that Christ is simply greatest, 
Lord, Ruler, whereas to be subject or servant or less is to be attributed 
to Him with the qualification, in His human nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Cyril and Damascene deny that Christ is the head of Himself 
inasmuch as this implies a plurality of supposita, which is required in 
order that anyone may be the master of another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Simply speaking it is necessary that the master and the 
servant should be distinct; yet a certain notion of mastership and 
subservience may be preserved inasmuch as the same one is master of 
Himself in different respects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> On account of the divers parts of man, one of which is 
superior and the other inferior, the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 11) that 
there is justice between a man and himself inasmuch as the irascible and 
concupiscible powers obey reason. Hence this way a man may be said to be 
subject and subservient to Himself as regards His different parts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[20] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To the other arguments, the reply is clear from what has been said. For 
Augustine asserts that the Son is less than, or subject to, Himself in 
His human nature, and not by a diversity of supposita.<br>
