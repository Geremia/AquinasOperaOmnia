<H3 Align="Center">OF THE RETURN OF SINS WHICH HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY BY PENANCE (FOUR ARTICLES) <br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the return of sins which have been taken away by 
Penance: under which head there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP088.html#TPQ88A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether sins which have been taken away by Penance return simply 
through a subsequent sin?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP088.html#TPQ88A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether more specially as regards certain sins they return, in a 
way, on account of ingratitude?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP088.html#TPQ88A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the debt of punishment remains the same for sins thus 
returned?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP088.html#TPQ88A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether this ingratitude, on account of which sins return, is a 
special sin?<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sins once forgiven return through a subsequent 
sin. For Augustine says (De Bapt. contra Donat. i, 12): "Our Lord teaches 
most explicitly in the Gospel that sins which have been forgiven return, 
when fraternal charity ceases, in the example of the servant from whom 
his master exacted the payment of the debt already forgiven, because he 
had refused to forgive the debt of his fellow-servant." Now fraternal 
charity is destroyed through each mortal sin. Therefore sins already 
taken away through Penance, return through each subsequent mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, on Lk. 11:24, "I will return into my house, whence I 
came out," Bede says: "This verse should make us tremble, we should not 
endeavor to explain it away lest through carelessness we give place to 
the sin which we thought to have been taken away, and become its slave 
once more." Now this would not be so unless it returned. Therefore a sin 
returns after once being taken away by Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Lord said (Ezech. 18:24): "If the just man turn 
himself away from his justice, and do iniquity . . . all his justices 
which he hath done, shall not be remembered." Now among the other 
"justices" which he had done, is also his previous penance, since it was 
said above (<A Href="TP085.html#TPQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="TP085.html#TPQ85A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that penance is a part of justice. Therefore 
when one who has done penance, sins, his previous penance, whereby he 
received forgiveness of his sins, is not imputed to him. Therefore his 
sins return.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, past sins are covered by grace, as the Apostle declares 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++4:7">Rm. 4:7</a>) where he quotes Ps. 31:1: "Blessed are they whose iniquities 
are forgiven, and whose sins are covered." But a subsequent mortal sin 
takes away grace. Therefore the sins committed previously, become 
uncovered: and so, seemingly, they return.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++11:29">Rm. 11:29</a>): "The gifts and the 
calling of God are without repentance." Now the penitent's sins are taken 
away by a gift of God. Therefore the sins which have been taken away do 
not return through a subsequent sin, as though God repented His gift of 
forgiveness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, Augustine says (Lib. Resp. Prosperi i [*Cf. Prosper, 
Responsiones ad Capitula Gallorum ii]): "When he that turns away from 
Christ, comes to the end of this life a stranger to grace, whither does 
he go, except to perdition? Yet he does not fall back into that which had 
been forgiven, nor will he be condemned for original sin."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86OUTP1">Question [86]</a>, <A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), mortal sin contains two 
things, aversion from God and adherence to a created good. Now, in mortal 
sin, whatever attaches to the aversion, is, considered in itself, common 
to all mortal sins, since man turns away from God by every mortal sin, so 
that, in consequence, the stain resulting from the privation of grace, 
and the debt of everlasting punishment are common to all mortal sins. 
This is what is meant by what is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+2:10">James 2:10</a>): "Whosoever . . . 
shall offend in one point, is become guilty of all." On the other hand, 
as regards their adherence they are different from, and sometimes 
contrary to one another. Hence it is evident, that on the part of the 
adherence, a subsequent mortal sin does not cause the return of mortal 
sins previously dispelled, else it would follow that by a sin of 
wastefulness a man would be brought back to the habit or disposition of 
avarice previously dispelled, so that one contrary would be the cause of 
another, which is impossible. But if in mortal sins we consider that 
which attaches to the aversion absolutely, then a subsequent mortal sin 
[causes the return of that which was comprised in the mortal sins before 
they were pardoned, in so far as the subsequent mortal sin] [*The words 
in brackets are omitted in the Leonine edition.]  deprives man of grace, 
and makes him deserving of everlasting punishment, just as he was before. 
Nevertheless, since the aversion of mortal sin is [in a way, caused by 
the adherence, those things which attach to the aversion are*] 
diversified somewhat in relation to various adherences, as it were to 
various causes, so that there will be a different aversion, a different 
stain, a different debt of punishment, according to the different acts of 
mortal sin from which they arise; hence the question is moved whether the 
stain and the debt of eternal punishment, as caused by acts of sins 
previously pardoned, return through a subsequent mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly some have maintained that they return simply even in this 
way. But this is impossible, because what God has done cannot be undone 
by the work of man. Now the pardon of the previous sins was a work of 
Divine mercy, so that it cannot be undone by man's subsequent sin, 
according to Rm. 3:3: "Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without 
effect?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore others who maintained the possibility of sins returning, said 
that God pardons the sins of a penitent who will afterwards sin again, 
not according to His foreknowledge, but only according to His present 
justice: since He foresees that He will punish such a man eternally for 
his sins, and yet, by His grace, He makes him righteous for the present. 
But this cannot stand: because if a cause be placed absolutely, its 
effect is placed absolutely; so that if the remission of sins were 
effected by grace and the sacraments of grace, not absolutely but under 
some condition  dependent on some future event, it would follow that 
grace and the sacraments of grace are not the sufficient causes of the 
remission of sins, which is erroneous, as being derogatory to God's grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently it is in no way possible for the stain of past sins and the 
debt of punishment incurred thereby, to return, as caused by those acts. 
Yet it may happen that a subsequent sinful act virtually contains the 
debt of punishment due to the previous sin, in so far as when a man sins 
a second time, for this very reason he seems to sin more grievously than 
before, as stated in Rm. 2:5: "According to thy hardness and impenitent 
heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath," 
from the mere fact, namely, that God's goodness, which waits for us to 
repent, is despised. And so much the more is God's goodness despised, if 
the first sin is committed a second time after having been forgiven, as 
it is a greater favor for the sin to be forgiven than for the sinner to 
be endured.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly the sin which follows repentance brings back, in a sense, 
the debt of punishment due to the sins previously forgiven, not as caused 
by those sins already forgiven but as caused by this last sin being 
committed, on account of its being aggravated in view of those previous 
sins. This means that those sins return, not simply, but in a restricted 
sense, viz., in so far as they are virtually contained in the subsequent 
sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This saying of Augustine seems to refer to the return of 
sins as to the debt of eternal punishment considered in itself, namely, 
that he who sins after doing penance incurs a debt of eternal punishment, 
just as before, but not altogether for the same "reason." Wherefore 
Augustine, after saying (Lib. Resp. Prosperi i [*Cf. Prosper, 
Responsiones ad Capitula Gallorum ii]) that "he does not fall back into 
that which was forgiven, nor will he be condemned for original sin," 
adds: "Nevertheless, for these last sins he will be condemned to the same 
death, which he deserved to suffer for the former," because he incurs the 
punishment of eternal death which he deserved for his previous sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By these words Bede means that the guilt already forgiven 
enslaves man, not by the return of his former debt of punishment, but by 
the repetition of his act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The effect of a subsequent sin is that the former 
"justices" are not remembered, in so far as they were deserving of 
eternal life, but not in so far as they were a hindrance to sin. 
Consequently if a man sins mortally after making restitution, he does not 
become guilty as though he had not paid back what he owed; and much less 
is penance previously done forgotten as to the pardon of the guilt, since 
this is the work of God rather than of man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Grace removes the stain and the debt of eternal punishment 
simply; but it covers the past sinful acts, lest, on their account, God 
deprive man of grace, and judge him deserving of eternal punishment; and 
what grace has once done, endures for ever.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether sins that have been forgiven, return through ingratitude which is shown especially in four kinds of sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sins do not return through ingratitude, which 
is shown especially in four kinds of sin, viz., hatred of one's neighbor, 
apostasy from faith, contempt of confession and regret for past 
repentance, and which have been expressed in the following verse:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Fratres odit, apostata fit, spernitque, fateri,
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Poenituisse piget, pristina culpa redit."
For the more grievous the sin committed against God after one has 
received the grace of pardon, the greater the ingratitude. But there are 
sins more grievous than these, such as blasphemy against God, and the sin 
against the Holy Ghost. Therefore it seems that sins already pardoned do 
not return through ingratitude as manifested in these sins, any more than 
as shown in other sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Rabanus says: "God delivered the wicked servant to the 
torturers, until he should pay the whole debt, because a man will be 
deemed punishable not only for the sins he commits after Baptism, but 
also for original sin which was taken away when he was baptized." Now 
venial sins are reckoned among our debts, since we pray in their regard: 
"Forgive us our trespasses [debita]." Therefore they too return through 
ingratitude; and, in like manner seemingly, sins already pardoned return 
through venial sins, and not only through those sins mentioned above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, ingratitude is all the greater, according as one sins 
after receiving a greater favor. Now innocence whereby one avoids sin is 
a Divine favor, for Augustine says (Confess. ii): "Whatever sins I have 
avoided committing, I owe it to Thy grace." Now innocence is a greater 
gift, than even the forgiveness of all sins. Therefore the first sin 
committed after innocence is no less an ingratitude to God, than a sin 
committed after repentance, so that seemingly ingratitude in respect of 
the aforesaid sins is not the chief cause of sins returning.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xviii [*Cf. Dial. iv]): "It is 
evident from the words of the Gospel that if we do not forgive from our 
hearts the offenses committed against us, we become once more accountable 
for what we rejoiced in as forgiven through Penance": so that ingratitude 
implied in the hatred of one's brother is a special cause of the return 
of sins already forgiven: and the same seems to apply to the others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP088.html#TPQ88A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), sins pardoned through Penance are 
said to return, in so far as their debt of punishment, by reason of 
ingratitude, is virtually contained in the subsequent sin. Now one may be 
guilty of ingratitude in two ways: first by doing something against the 
favor received, and, in this way, man is ungrateful to God in every 
mortal sin whereby he offends God Who  forgave his sins, so that by every 
subsequent mortal sin, the sins previously pardoned return, on account of 
the ingratitude. Secondly, one is guilty of ingratitude, by doing 
something not only against the favor itself, but also against the form of 
the favor received. If this form be considered on the part of the 
benefactor, it is the remission of something due to him; wherefore he who 
does not forgive his brother when he asks pardon, and persists in his 
hatred, acts against this form. If, however, this form be taken in regard 
to the penitent who receives this favor, we find on his part a twofold 
movement of the free-will. The first is the movement of the free-will 
towards God, and is an act of faith quickened by charity; and against 
this a man acts by apostatizing from the faith. The second is a movement 
of the free-will against sin, and is the act of penance. This act 
consists first, as we have stated above (<A Href="TP085.html#TPQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="TP085.html#TPQ85ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,5) in man's 
detestation of his past sins; and against this a man acts when he regrets 
having done penance. Secondly, the act of penance consists in the 
penitent purposing to subject himself to the keys of the Church by 
confession, according to Ps. 31:5: "I said: I will confess against myself 
my injustice to the Lord: and Thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my 
sin": and against this a man acts when he scorns to confess as he had 
purposed to do.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly it is said that the ingratitude of sinners is a special 
cause of the return of sins previously forgiven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This is not said of these sins as though they were more 
grievous than others, but because they are more directly opposed to the 
favor of the forgiveness of sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even venial sins and original sin return in the way 
explained above, just as mortal sins do, in so far as the favor conferred 
by God in forgiving those sins is despised. A man does not, however, 
incur ingratitude by committing a venial sin, because by sinning venially 
man does not act against God, but apart from Him, wherefore venial sins 
nowise cause the return of sins already forgiven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A favor can be weighed in two ways. First by the quantity 
of the favor itself, and in this way innocence is a greater favor from 
God than penance, which is called the second plank after shipwreck (cf. 
Question [84], Article [6]). Secondly, a favor may be weighed with regard to the 
recipient, who is less worthy, wherefore a greater favor is bestowed on 
him, so that he is the more ungrateful if he scorns it. In this way the 
favor of the pardon of sins is greater when bestowed on one who is 
altogether unworthy, so that the ingratitude which follows is all the 
greater.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the debt of punishment that arises through ingratitude in respect of a subsequent sin is as great as that of the sins previously pardoned?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the debt of punishment arising  through 
ingratitude in respect of a subsequent sin is as great as that of the 
sins previously pardoned. Because the greatness of the favor of the 
pardon of sins is according to the greatness of the sin pardoned, and so 
too, in consequence, is the greatness of the ingratitude whereby this 
favor is scorned. But the greatness of the consequent debt of punishment 
is in accord with the greatness of the ingratitude. Therefore the debt of 
punishment arising through ingratitude in respect of a subsequent sin is 
as great as the debt of punishment due for all the previous sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is a greater sin to offend God than to offend man. 
But a slave who is freed by his master returns to the same state of 
slavery from which he was freed, or even to a worse state. Much more 
therefore he that sins against God after being freed from sin, returns to 
the debt of as great a punishment as he had incurred before.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++18:34">Mt. 18:34</a>) that "his lord being angry, 
delivered him" (whose sins returned to him on account of his ingratitude) 
"to the torturers, until he paid all the debt." But this would not be so 
unless the debt of punishment incurred through ingratitude were as great 
as that incurred through all previous sins. Therefore an equal debt of 
punishment returns through ingratitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++25:2">Dt. 25:2</a>): "According to the measure of 
the sin shall the measure also of the stripes be," whence it is evident 
that a great debt of punishment does not arise from a slight sin. But 
sometimes a subsequent mortal sin is much less grievous than any one of 
those previously pardoned. Therefore the debt of punishment incurred 
through subsequent sins is not equal to that of sins previously forgiven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have maintained that the debt of punishment incurred 
through ingratitude in respect of a subsequent sin is equal to that of 
the sins previously pardoned, in addition to the debt proper to this 
subsequent sin. But there is no need for this, because, as stated above 
(<A Href="TP088.html#TPQ88A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the debt of punishment incurred by previous sins does not return 
on account of a subsequent sin, as resulting from the acts of the 
subsequent sin. Wherefore the amount of the debt that returns must be 
according to the gravity of the subsequent sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible, however, for the gravity of the subsequent sin to equal 
the gravity of all previous sins. But it need not always be so, whether 
we speak of the gravity which a sin has from its species (since the 
subsequent sin may be one of simple fornication, while the previous sins 
were adulteries, murders, or sacrileges); or of the gravity which it 
incurs through the ingratitude connected with it. For it is not necessary 
that the measure of ingratitude should be exactly equal to the measure of 
the favor received, which latter is measured according to the greatness 
of the sins previously pardoned. Because it may happen that in respect of 
the same favor, one man is very ungrateful, either on account of the  
intensity of his scorn for the favor received, or on account of the 
gravity of the offense committed against the benefactor, while another 
man is slightly ungrateful, either because his scorn is less intense, or 
because his offense against the benefactor is less grave. But the measure 
of ingratitude is proportionately equal to the measure of the favor 
received: for supposing an equal contempt of the favor, or an equal 
offense against the benefactor, the ingratitude will be so much the 
greater, as the favor received is greater.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence it is evident that the debt of punishment incurred by a subsequent 
sin need not always be equal to that of previous sins; but it must be in 
proportion thereto, so that the more numerous or the greater the sins 
previously pardoned, the greater must be the debt of punishment incurred 
by any subsequent mortal sin whatever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The favor of the pardon of sins takes its absolute quantity 
from the quantity of the sins previously pardoned: but the sin of 
ingratitude does not take its absolute quantity from the measure of the 
favor bestowed, but from the measure of the contempt or of the offense, 
as stated above: and so the objection does not prove.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A slave who has been given his freedom is not brought back 
to his previous state of slavery for any kind of ingratitude, but only 
when this is grave.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He whose forgiven sins return to him on account of 
subsequent ingratitude, incurs the debt for all, in so far as the measure 
of his previous sins is contained proportionally in his subsequent 
ingratitude, but not absolutely, as stated above.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the ingratitude whereby a subsequent sin causes the return of previous sins, is a special sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the ingratitude, whereby a subsequent sin 
causes the return of sins previously forgiven, is a special sin. For the 
giving of thanks belongs to counterpassion which is a necessary condition 
of justice, as the Philosopher shows (Ethic. v, 5). But justice is a 
special virtue. Therefore this ingratitude is a special sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Tully says (De Inv. Rhet. ii) that thanksgiving is a 
special virtue. But ingratitude is opposed to thanksgiving. Therefore 
ingratitude is a special sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a special effect proceeds from a special cause. Now 
ingratitude has a special effect, viz. the return, after a fashion, of 
sins already forgiven. Therefore ingratitude is a special sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> That which is a sequel to every sin is not a special 
sin. Now by any mortal sin whatever, a man becomes  ungrateful to God, as 
evidenced from what has been said (<A Href="TP088.html#TPQ88A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore ingratitude is not a 
special sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The ingratitude of the sinner is sometimes a special sin; 
and sometimes it is not, but a circumstance arising from all mortal sins 
in common committed against God. For a sin takes its species according to 
the sinner's intention, wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 2) that 
"he who commits adultery in order to steal is a thief rather than an 
adulterer."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, therefore, a sinner commits a sin in contempt of God and of the 
favor received from Him, that sin is drawn to the species of ingratitude, 
and in this way a sinner's ingratitude is a special sin. If, however, a 
man, while intending to commit a sin, e.g. murder or adultery, is not 
withheld from it on account of its implying contempt of God, his 
ingratitude will not be a special sin, but will be drawn to the species 
of the other sin, as a circumstance thereof. And, as Augustine observes 
(De Nat. et Grat. xxix), not every sin implies contempt of God in His 
commandments. Therefore it is evident that the sinner's ingratitude is 
sometimes a special sin, sometimes not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[88] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Replies to the Objections: for the first (three) 
objections prove that ingratitude is in itself a special sin; while the 
last objection proves that ingratitude, as included in every sin, is not 
a special sin.<br>
