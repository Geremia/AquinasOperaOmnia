  <h3 align="center">OF CHRIST'S JUDICIARY POWER (SIX ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We have now to consider Christ's judiciary power. Under this head there are
    six points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP059.html#TPQ59A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether judiciary power is to be
    attributed to Christ?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP059.html#TPQ59A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it belongs to Him as man?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP059.html#TPQ59A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether He acquired it by merits?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP059.html#TPQ59A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether His judiciary power is
    universal with regard to all men?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP059.html#TPQ59A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether besides the judgment that
    takes place now in time, we are to expect Him in the future general
    judgment?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP059.html#TPQ59A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether His judiciary power
    extends likewise to the angels?
  </p>
  <p>
    It will be more suitable to consider the execution of the Last Judgment when
    we treat of things pertaining to the end of the world [*See XP, Questions
    [88], seqq.]. For the present it will be enough to touch on those points
    that concern Christ's dignity.<br />

    Whether judiciary power is to be specially attributed to Christ?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that judiciary power is not to be
    specially attributed to Christ. For judgment of others seems to belong to
    their lord; hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++14%3A4"
      >Rm. 14:4</a
    >): "Who art thou that judgest another man's servant?" But, it belongs to
    the entire Trinity to be Lord over creatures. Therefore judiciary power
    ought not to be attributed specially to Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++7%3A9"
      >Dan. 7:9</a
    >): "The Ancient of days sat"; and further on (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++7%3A10"
      >Dan. 7:10</a
    >), "the judgment sat, and the books were opened." But the Ancient of days
    is understood to be the Father, because as Hilary says (De Trin. ii):
    "Eternity is in the Father." Consequently, judiciary power ought rather to
    be attributed to the Father than to Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it seems to belong to the same person to
    judge as it does to convince. But it belongs to the Holy Ghost to convince:
    for our Lord says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++16%3A8"
      >Jn. 16:8</a
    >): "And when He is come," i.e. the Holy Ghost, "He will convince the world
    of sin, and of justice, and of judgment." Therefore judiciary power ought to
    be attributed to the Holy Ghost rather than to Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said of Christ (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+10%3A42"
      >Acts 10:42</a
    >): "It is He who was appointed by God, to be judge of the living end of the
    dead."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Three things are required for passing judgment:
    first, the power of coercing subjects; hence it is written (Ecclus. 7:6):
    "Seek not to be made a judge unless thou have strength enough to extirpate
    iniquities." The second thing required is upright zeal, so as to pass
    judgment not out of hatred or malice, but from love of justice, according to
    Prov. 3:12: "For whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth: and as a father in the
    son He pleaseth Himself." Thirdly, wisdom is needed, upon which judgment is
    based, according to Ecclus. 10:1: "A wise judge shall judge his people." The
    first two are conditions for judging; but on the third the very rule of
    judgment is based, because the standard of judgment is the law of wisdom or
    truth, according to which the judgment is passed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now because the Son is Wisdom begotten, and Truth proceeding from the
    Father, and His perfect Image, consequently, judiciary power is properly
    attributed to the Son of God. Accordingly Augustine says (De Vera Relig.
    xxxi): "This is that unchangeable Truth, which is rightly styled the law of
    all arts, and the art of the Almighty Craftsman. But even as we and all
    rational souls judge aright of the things beneath us, so does He who alone
    is Truth itself pass judgment on us, when we cling to Him. But the Father
    judges Him not, for He is the Truth no less than Himself. Consequently,
    whatever the Father judges, He judges through It." Further on he concludes
    by saying: "Therefore the Father judges no man, but has given all judgment
    to the Son."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument proves that judiciary
    power is common to the entire Trinity, which is quite true: still by special
    appropriation such power is attributed to the Son, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Trin. vi),
    eternity is attributed to the Father, because He is the Principle, which is
    implied in the idea of eternity. And in the same place Augustine says that
    the Son is the art of the Father. So, then, judiciary authority is
    attributed to the Father, inasmuch as He is the Principle of the Son, but
    the very rule of judgment is attributed to the Son who is the art and wisdom
    of the Father, so that as the Father does all things through the Son,
    inasmuch as the Son is His art, so He judges all things through the Son,
    inasmuch as the Son is His wisdom and truth. And this is implied by Daniel,
    when he says in the first passage that "the Ancient of days sat," and when
    he subsequently adds that the Son of Man "came even to the Ancient of days,
    who gave Him power, and glory, and a kingdom": and thereby we are given to
    understand that the authority for judging lies with the Father, from whom
    the Son received the power to judge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Tract. xcv in Joan.):
    "Christ said that the Holy Ghost shall convince the world of sin, as if to
    say 'He shall pour out charity upon your hearts.' For thus, when fear is
    driven away, you shall have freedom for convincing." Consequently, then,
    judgment is attributed to the Holy Ghost, not as regards the rule of
    judgment, but as regards man's desire to judge others aright.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether judiciary power belongs to Christ as man?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that judiciary power does not
    belong to Christ as man. For Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xxxi) that
    judgment is attributed to the Son inasmuch as He is the law of the first
    truth. But this is Christ's attribute as God. Consequently, judiciary power
    does not belong to Christ as man but as God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to judiciary power to reward
    the good, just as to punish the wicked. But eternal beatitude, which is the
    reward of good works, is bestowed by God alone: thus Augustine says (Tract.
    xxiii super Joan.) that "the soul is made blessed by participation of God,
    and not by participation of a holy soul." Therefore it seems that judiciary
    power does not belong to Christ as man, but as God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it belongs to Christ's judiciary power
    to judge secrets of hearts, according to 1 Cor. 4:5: "Judge not before the
    time; until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of
    darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts." But this
    belongs exclusively to the Divine power, according to Jer. 17:9,10: "The
    heart of man is perverse and unsearchable, who can know it? I am the Lord
    who search the heart, and prove the reins: who give to every one according
    to his way." Therefore judiciary power does not belong to Christ as man but
    as God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++5%3A27"
      >Jn. 5:27</a
    >): "He hath given Him power to do judgment, because He is the Son of
    man."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Chrysostom (Hom. xxxix in Joan.) seems to think
    that judiciary power belongs to Christ not as man, but only as God.
    Accordingly he thus explains the passage just quoted from John: "'He gave
    Him power to do judgment, because He is the Son of man: wonder not at this.'
    For He received judiciary power, not because He is man; but because He is
    the Son of the ineffable God, therefore is He judge. But since the
    expressions used were greater than those appertaining to man, He said in
    explanation: 'Wonder not at this, because He is the Son of man, for He is
    likewise the Son of God.'" And he proves this by the effect of the
    Resurrection: wherefore He adds: "Because the hour cometh when the dead in
    their graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But it must be observed that although the primary authority of judging rests
    with God, nevertheless the power to judge is committed to men with regard to
    those subject to their jurisdiction. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++1%3A16"
      >Dt. 1:16</a
    >): "Judge that which is just"; and further on (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++1%3A17"
      >Dt. 1:17</a
    >): "Because it is the judgment of God," that is to say, it is by His
    authority that you judge. Now it was said before (<a
      href="TP008.html#TPQ8OUTP1"
      >Question [8]</a
    >, <a href="TP008.html#TPQ8ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4) that Christ even in
    His human nature is Head of the entire Church, and that God has "put all
    things under His feet." Consequently, it belongs to Him, even according to
    His human nature, to exercise judiciary power. on this account. it seems
    that the authority of Scripture quoted above must be interpreted thus: "He
    gave Him power to do judgment, because He is the Son of Man"; not on account
    of the condition of His nature, for thus all men would have this kind of
    power, as Chrysostom objects (Hom. xxxix in Joan.); but because this belongs
    to the grace of the Head, which Christ received in His human nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now judiciary power belongs to Christ in this way according to His human
    nature on three accounts. First, because of His likeness and kinship with
    men; for, as God works through intermediary causes, as being closer to the
    effects, so He judges men through the Man Christ, that His judgment may be
    sweeter to men. Hence (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++4%3A15"
      >Heb. 4:15</a
    >) the Apostle says: "For we have not a high-priest, who cannot have
    compassion on our infirmities; but one tempted in all things like as we are,
    without sin. Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of His
    grace." Secondly, because at the last judgment, as Augustine says (Tract.
    xix in Joan.), "there will be a resurrection of dead bodies, which God will
    raise up through the Son of Man"; just as by "the same Christ He raises
    souls," inasmuch as "He is the Son of God." Thirdly, because, as Augustine
    observes (De Verb. Dom., Serm. cxxvii): "It was but right that those who
    were to be judged should see their judge. But those to be judged were the
    good and the bad. It follows that the form of a servant should be shown in
    the judgment to both good and wicked, while the form of God should be kept
    for the good alone."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Judgment belongs to truth as its
    standard, while it belongs to the man imbued with truth, according as he is
    as it were one with truth, as a kind of law and "living justice"
    [*Aristotle, Ethic. v]. Hence Augustine quotes (De Verb. Dom., Serm. cxxvii)
    the saying of 1 Cor. 2:15: "The spiritual man judgeth all things." But
    beyond all creatures Christ's soul was more closely united with truth, and
    more full of truth; according to Jn. 1:14: "We saw Him... full of grace and
    truth." And according to this it belongs principally to the soul of Christ
    to judge all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It belongs to God alone to bestow
    beatitude upon souls by a participation with Himself; but it is Christ's
    prerogative to bring them to such beatitude, inasmuch as He is their Head
    and the author of their salvation, according to Heb. 2:10: "Who had brought
    many children into glory, to perfect the author of their salvation by His
    Passion."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To know and judge the secrets of hearts,
    of itself belongs to God alone; but from the overflow of the Godhead into
    Christ's soul it belongs to Him also to know and to judge the secrets of
    hearts, as we stated above (<a href="TP010.html#TPQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a
    >, <a href="TP010.html#TPQ10A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), when dealing with the
    knowledge of Christ. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++2%3A16"
      >Rm. 2:16</a
    >): "In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ."<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether Christ acquired His judiciary power by His merits?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ did not acquire His
    judiciary power by His merits. For judiciary power flows from the royal
    dignity: according to Prov. 20:8: "The king that sitteth on the throne of
    judgment, scattereth away all evil with his look." But it was without merits
    that Christ acquired royal power, for it is His due as God's Only-begotten
    Son: thus it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++1%3A32"
      >Lk. 1:32</a
    >): "The Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of David His father, and He
    shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever." Therefore Christ did not obtain
    judiciary power by His merits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<a
      href="TP059.html#TPQ59A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), judiciary power is Christ's due inasmuch as He is our Head. But the
    grace of headship does not belong to Christ by reason of merit, but follows
    the personal union of the Divine and human natures: according to Jn.
    1:14,16: "We saw His glory... as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of
    grace and truth... and of His fulness we all have received": and this
    pertains to the notion of headship. Consequently, it seems that Christ did
    not have judiciary power from merits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++2%3A15"
      >1 Cor. 2:15</a
    >): "The spiritual man judgeth all things." But a man becomes spiritual
    through grace, which is not from merits; otherwise it is "no more grace," as
    is said in Rm. 11:6. Therefore it seems that judiciary power belongs neither
    to Christ nor to others from any merits, but from grace alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+36%3A17"
      >Job 36:17</a
    >): "Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked, cause and judgment
    thou shalt recover." And Augustine says (Serm. cxxvii): "The Judge shall
    sit, who stood before a judge; He shall condemn the truly wicked, who
    Himself was falsely reputed wicked."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There is nothing to hinder one and the same
    thing from being due to some one from various causes: as the glory of the
    body in rising was due to Christ not only as befitting His Godhead and His
    soul's glory, but likewise "from the merit of the lowliness of His Passion"
    [*Cf. Augustine, Tract. civ in Joan.]. And in the same way it must be said
    that judiciary power belongs to the Man Christ on account of both His Divine
    personality, and the dignity of His headship, and the fulness of His
    habitual grace: and yet He obtained it from merit, so that, in accordance
    with the Divine justice, He should be judge who fought for God's justice,
    and conquered, and was unjustly condemned. Hence He Himself says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++3%3A21"
      >Apoc. 3:21</a
    >): "I have overcome and am set down in My Father's throne [Vulg.: 'with My
    Father in His throne']." Now judiciary power is understood by "throne,"
    according to Ps. 9:5: "Thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest justice."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument holds good of judiciary
    power according as it is due to Christ by reason of the union with the Word
    of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument is based on the ground of
    His grace as Head.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument holds good in regard to
    habitual grace, which perfects Christ's soul. But although judiciary power
    be Christ's due in these ways, it is not hindered from being His due from
    merit.<br />

    human affairs does not belong to Christ. For as we read in Lk. 12:13,14,
    when one of the crowd said to Christ: "Speak to my brother that he divide
    the inheritance with me; He said to him: Man, who hath appointed Me judge,
    or divider over you?" Consequently, He does not exercise judgment over all
    human affairs.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one exercises judgment except over
    his own subjects. But, according to Heb. 2:8, "we see not as yet all things
    subject to" Christ. Therefore it seems that Christ has not judgment over all
    human affairs.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xx) that it
    is part of Divine judgment for the good to be afflicted sometimes in this
    world, and sometimes to prosper, and in like manner the wicked. But the same
    was the case also before the Incarnation. Consequently, not all God's
    judgments regarding human affairs are included in Christ's judiciary
    power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++5%3A22"
      >Jn. 5:22</a
    >): "The Father hath given all judgment to the Son."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> If we speak of Christ according to His Divine
    Nature, it is evident that every judgment of the Father belongs to the Son;
    for, as the Father does all things through His Word, so He judges all things
    through His Word.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if we speak of Christ in His human nature, thus again is it evident that
    all things are subject to His judgment. This is made clear if we consider
    first of all the relationship subsisting between Christ's soul and the Word
    of God; for, if "the spiritual man judgeth all things," as is said in 1 Cor.
    2:15, inasmuch as his soul clings to the Word of God, how much more Christ's
    soul, which is filled with the truth of the Word of God, passes judgment
    upon all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, the same appears from the merit of His death; because, according
    to Rm. 14:9: "To this end Christ died and rose again; that He might be Lord
    both of the dead and of the living." And therefore He has judgment over all
    men; and on this account the Apostle adds (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++14%3A10"
      >Rm. 14:10</a
    >): "We shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ": and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++7%3A14"
      >Dan. 7:14</a
    >) it is written that "He gave Him power, and glory, and a kingdom; and all
    peoples, tribes, and tongues shall serve Him."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, the same thing is evident from comparison of human affairs with the
    end of human salvation. For, to whomsoever the substance is entrusted, the
    accessory is likewise committed. Now all human affairs are ordered for the
    end of beatitude, which is everlasting salvation, to which men are admitted,
    or from which they are excluded by Christ's judgment, as is evident from Mt.
    25:31,40. Consequently, it is manifest that all human affairs are included
    in Christ's judiciary power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As was said above (<a
      href="TP059.html#TPQ59A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >, Objection [1]), judiciary power goes with royal dignity. Now Christ,
    although established king by God, did not wish while living on earth to
    govern temporarily an earthly kingdom; consequently He said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++18%3A36"
      >Jn. 18:36</a
    >): "My kingdom is not of this world." In like fashion He did not wish to
    exercise judiciary power over temporal concerns, since He came to raise men
    to Divine things. Hence Ambrose observes on this passage in Luke: "It is
    well that He who came down with a Divine purpose should hold Himself aloof
    from temporal concerns; nor does He deign to be a judge of quarrels and an
    arbiter of property, since He is judge of the quick and the dead, and the
    arbitrator of merits."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All things are subject to Christ in
    respect of that power, which He received from the Father, over all things,
    according to Mt. 28:18: "All power is given to Me in heaven and in earth."
    But as to the exercise of this power, all things are not yet subject to Him:
    this will come to pass in the future, when He shall fulfil His will
    regarding all things, by saving some and punishing others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Judgments of this kind were exercised by
    Christ before His Incarnation, inasmuch as He is the Word of God: and the
    soul united with Him personally became a partaker of this power by the
    Incarnation.<br />

    Whether after the Judgment that takes place in the present time, there
    remains yet another General Judgment?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that after the Judgment that takes
    place in the present time, there does not remain another General Judgment.
    For a judgment serves no purpose after the final allotment of rewards and
    punishments. But rewards and punishments are allotted in this present time:
    for our Lord said to the thief on the cross (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++23%3A43"
      >Lk. 23:43</a
    >): "This day thou shalt be with Me in paradise": and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++16%3A22"
      >Lk. 16:22</a
    >) it is said that "the rich man died and was buried in hell." Therefore it
    is useless to look forward to a final Judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to another (the Septuagint)
    version of Nahum 1:9, "God shall not judge the same thing a second time."
    But in the present time God judges both temporal and spiritual matters.
    Therefore, it does not seem that another final judgment is to be
    expected.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, reward and punishment correspond with
    merit and demerit. But merit and demerit bear relation to the body only in
    so far as it is the instrument of the soul. Therefore reward or punishment
    is not due to the body save as the soul's instrument. Therefore no other
    Judgment is called for at the end (of the world) to requite man with reward
    or punishment in the body, besides that Judgment in which souls are now
    punished or rewarded.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said in Jn. 12:48: "The word that I
    have spoken, the same shall judge you [Vulg.: 'him'] in the last day."
    Therefore there will be a Judgment at the last day besides that which takes
    place in the present time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Judgment cannot be passed perfectly upon any
    changeable subject before its consummation: just as judgment cannot be given
    perfectly regarding the quality of any action before its completion in
    itself and in its results: because many actions appear to be profitable,
    which in their effects prove to be hurtful. And in the same way perfect
    judgment cannot be passed upon any man before the close of his life, since
    he can be changed in many respects from good to evil, or conversely, or from
    good to better, or from evil to worse. Hence the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++9%3A27"
      >Heb. 9:27</a
    >): "It is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the Judgment."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But it must be observed that although man's temporal life in itself ends
    with death, still it continues dependent in a measure on what comes after it
    in the future. In one way, as it still lives on in men's memories, in which
    sometimes, contrary to the truth, good or evil reputations linger on. In
    another way in a man's children, who are so to speak something of their
    parent, according to Ecclus. 30:4: "His father is dead, and he is as if he
    were not dead, for he hath left one behind him that is like himself." And
    yet many good men have wicked sons, and conversely. Thirdly, as to the
    result of his actions: just as from the deceit of Arius and other false
    leaders unbelief continues to flourish down to the close of the world; and
    even until then faith will continue to derive its progress from the
    preaching of the apostles. In a fourth way, as to the body, which is
    sometimes buried with honor and sometimes left unburied, and finally falls
    to dust utterly. In a fifth way, as to the things upon which a man's heart
    is set, such as temporal concerns, for example, some of which quickly lapse,
    while others endure longer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now all these things are submitted to the verdict of the Divine Judgment;
    and consequently, a perfect and public Judgment cannot be made of all these
    things during the course of this present time. Wherefore, there must be a
    final Judgment at the last day, in which everything concerning every man in
    every respect shall be perfectly and publicly judged.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some men have held the opinion that the
    souls of the saints shall not be rewarded in heaven, nor the souls of the
    lost punished in hell, until the Judgment-day. That this is false appears
    from the testimony of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++5%3A8"
      >2 Cor. 5:8</a
    >), where he says: "We are confident and have a good will to be absent
    rather from the body, and to be present with the Lord": that is, not to
    "walk by faith" but "by sight," as appears from the context. But this is to
    see God in His Essence, wherein consists "eternal life," as is clear from
    Jn. 17:3. Hence it is manifest that the souls separated from bodies are in
    eternal life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Consequently, it must be maintained that after death man enters into an
    unchangeable state as to all that concerns the soul: and therefore there is
    no need for postponing judgment as to the reward of the soul. But since
    there are some other things pertaining to a man which go on through the
    whole course of time, and which are not foreign to the Divine judgment, all
    these things must be brought to judgment at the end of time. For although in
    regard to such things a man neither merits nor demerits, still in a measure
    they accompany his reward or punishment. Consequently all these things must
    be weighed in the final judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> "God shall not judge twice the same
    thing," i.e. in the same respect; but it is not unseemly for God to judge
    twice according to different respects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the reward or punishment of the
    body depends upon the reward or punishment of the soul, nevertheless, since
    the soul is changeable only accidentally, on account of the body, once it is
    separated from the body it enters into an unchangeable condition, and
    receives its judgment. But the body remains subject to change down to the
    close of time: and therefore it must receive its reward or punishment then,
    in the last Judgment.<br />

    Whether Christ's judiciary power extends to the angels?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's judiciary power does
    not extend to the angels, because the good and wicked angels alike were
    judged in the beginning of the world, when some fell through sin while
    others were confirmed in bliss. But those already judged have no need of
    being judged again. Therefore Christ's judiciary power does not extend to
    the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the same person cannot be both judge and
    judged. But the angels will come to judge with Christ, according to Mt.
    25:31: "When the Son of Man shall come in His majesty, and all the angels
    with Him." Therefore it seems that the angels will not be judged by
    Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the angels are higher than other
    creatures. If Christ, then, be judge not only of men but likewise of angels,
    then for the same reason He will be judge of all creatures; which seems to
    be false, since this belongs to God's providence: hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+34%3A13"
      >Job 34:13</a
    >): "What other hath He appointed over the earth? or whom hath He set over
    the world which He made?" Therefore Christ is not the judge of the
    angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++6%3A3"
      >1 Cor. 6:3</a
    >): "Know you not that we shall judge angels?" But the saints judge only by
    Christ's authority. Therefore, much more does Christ possess judiciary power
    over the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The angels are subjects of Christ's judiciary
    power, not only with regard to His Divine Nature, as He is the Word of God,
    but also with regard to His human nature. And this is evident from three
    considerations. First of all, from the closeness of His assumed nature to
    God; because, according to Heb. 2:16: "For nowhere doth He take hold of the
    angels, but of the seed of Abraham He taketh hold." Consequently, Christ's
    soul is more filled with the truth of the Word of God than any angel: for
    which reason He also enlightens the angels, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier.
    vii), and so He has power to judge them. Secondly, because by the lowliness
    of His Passion, human nature in Christ merited to be exalted above the
    angels; so that, as is said in Phil. 2:10: "In the name of Jesus every knee
    should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth." And
    therefore Christ has judiciary power even over the good and wicked angels:
    in token whereof it is said in the Apocalypse (7:11) that "all the angels
    stood round about the throne." Thirdly, on account of what they do for men,
    of whom Christ is the Head in a special manner. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++1%3A14"
      >Heb. 1:14</a
    >): "They are [Vulg.: 'Are they not'] all ministering spirits, sent to
    minister for them, who shall receive the inheritance of salvation (?)." But
    they are submitted to Christ's judgment, first, as regards the dispensing of
    those things which are done through them; which dispensing is likewise done
    by the Man Christ, to whom the angels ministered, as related (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++4%3A11"
      >Mt. 4:11</a
    >), and from whom the devils besought that they might be sent into the
    swine, according to Mt. 8:31. Secondly, as to other accidental rewards of
    the good angels, such as the joy which they have at the salvation of men,
    according to Lk. 15:10: "There shall be joy before the angels of God upon
    one sinner doing penance": and furthermore as to the accidental punishments
    of the devils wherewith they are either tormented here, or are shut up in
    hell; and this also belongs to the Man Christ: hence it is written (Mk.
    1:24) that the devil cried out: "What have we to do with thee, Jesus of
    Nazareth? art Thou come to destroy us?" Thirdly, as to the essential reward
    of the good angels, which is everlasting bliss; and as to the essential
    punishment of the wicked angels, which is everlasting damnation. But this
    was done by Christ from the beginning of the world, inasmuch as He is the
    Word of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument considers judgment as to
    the essential reward and chief punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xxxi):
    "Although the spiritual man judgeth all things, still he is judged by Truth
    Itself." Consequently, although the angels judge, as being spiritual
    creatures, still they are judged by Christ, inasmuch as He is the Truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ judges not only the angels, but
    also the administration of all creatures. For if, as Augustine says (De
    Trin. iii) the lower things are ruled by God through the higher, in a
    certain order, it must be said that all things are ruled by Christ's soul,
    which is above every creature. Hence the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++2%3A5"
      >Heb. 2:5</a
    >): "For God hath not subjected unto angels the world to come"---subject
    namely to Christ---"of whom we speak" [Douay: 'whereof we speak'] [*The
    words "subject namely to Christ" are from a gloss]. Nor does it follow that
    God set another over the earth; since one and the same Person is God and
    Man, our Lord Jesus Christ.
