<H3 Align="Center">OF CHRIST'S JUDICIARY POWER (SIX ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider Christ's judiciary power. Under this head there 
are six points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP059.html#TPQ59A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether judiciary power is to be attributed to Christ?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP059.html#TPQ59A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it belongs to Him as man?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP059.html#TPQ59A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether He acquired it by merits? 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP059.html#TPQ59A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether His judiciary power is universal with regard to all men?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP059.html#TPQ59A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether besides the judgment that takes place now in time, we are to 
expect Him in the future general judgment?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP059.html#TPQ59A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether His judiciary power extends likewise to the angels?
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be more suitable to consider the execution of the Last Judgment 
when we treat of things pertaining to the end of the world [*See XP, 
Questions [88], seqq.]. For the present it will be enough to touch on those 
points that concern Christ's dignity.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether judiciary power is to be specially attributed to Christ?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that judiciary power is not to be specially 
attributed to Christ. For judgment of others seems to belong to their 
lord; hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++14:4">Rm. 14:4</a>): "Who art thou that judgest another 
man's servant?" But, it belongs to the entire Trinity to be Lord over 
creatures. Therefore judiciary power ought not to be attributed specially 
to Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dan++7:9">Dan. 7:9</a>): "The Ancient of days sat"; and 
further on (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dan++7:10">Dan. 7:10</a>), "the judgment sat, and the books were opened." 
But the Ancient of days is understood to be the Father, because as Hilary 
says (De Trin. ii): "Eternity is in the Father." Consequently, judiciary 
power ought rather to be attributed to the Father than to Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it seems to belong to the same person to judge as it 
does to convince. But it belongs to the Holy Ghost to convince: for our 
Lord says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++16:8">Jn. 16:8</a>): "And when He is come," i.e. the Holy Ghost, "He 
will convince the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgment." 
Therefore judiciary power ought to be attributed to the Holy Ghost rather 
than to Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said of Christ (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Acts+10:42">Acts 10:42</a>): "It is He who was 
appointed by God, to be judge of the living end of the dead."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Three things are required for passing judgment: first, 
the power of coercing subjects; hence it is written (Ecclus. 7:6): "Seek 
not to be made a judge unless thou have strength enough to extirpate 
iniquities." The second thing required is upright zeal, so as to pass 
judgment not out of hatred or malice, but from love of justice, according 
to Prov. 3:12: "For whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth: and as a father 
in the son He pleaseth Himself." Thirdly, wisdom is needed, upon which 
judgment is based, according to Ecclus. 10:1: "A wise judge shall judge 
his people." The first two are conditions for judging; but on the third 
the very rule of judgment is based, because the standard of judgment is 
the law of wisdom or truth, according to which the judgment is passed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now because the Son is Wisdom begotten, and Truth proceeding  from the 
Father, and His perfect Image, consequently, judiciary power is properly 
attributed to the Son of God. Accordingly Augustine says (De Vera Relig. 
xxxi): "This is that unchangeable Truth, which is rightly styled the law 
of all arts, and the art of the Almighty Craftsman. But even as we and 
all rational souls judge aright of the things beneath us, so does He who 
alone is Truth itself pass judgment on us, when we cling to Him. But the 
Father judges Him not, for He is the Truth no less than Himself. 
Consequently, whatever the Father judges, He judges through It." Further 
on he concludes by saying: "Therefore the Father judges no man, but has 
given all judgment to the Son."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument proves that judiciary power is common to the 
entire Trinity, which is quite true: still by special appropriation such 
power is attributed to the Son, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Trin. vi), eternity is attributed to 
the Father, because He is the Principle, which is implied in the idea of 
eternity. And in the same place Augustine says that the Son is the art of 
the Father. So, then, judiciary authority is attributed to the Father, 
inasmuch as He is the Principle of the Son, but the very rule of judgment 
is attributed to the Son who is the art and wisdom of the Father, so that 
as the Father does all things through the Son, inasmuch as the Son is His 
art, so He judges all things through the Son, inasmuch as the Son is His 
wisdom and truth. And this is implied by Daniel, when he says in the 
first passage that "the Ancient of days sat," and when he subsequently 
adds that the Son of Man "came even to the Ancient of days, who gave Him 
power, and glory, and a kingdom": and thereby we are given to understand 
that the authority for judging lies with the Father, from whom the Son 
received the power to judge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Tract. xcv in Joan.): "Christ said that 
the Holy Ghost shall convince the world of sin, as if to say 'He shall 
pour out charity upon your hearts.' For thus, when fear is driven away, 
you shall have freedom for convincing." Consequently, then, judgment is 
attributed to the Holy Ghost, not as regards the rule of judgment, but as 
regards man's desire to judge others aright.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether judiciary power belongs to Christ as man?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that judiciary power does not belong to Christ as 
man. For Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xxxi) that judgment is attributed 
to the Son inasmuch as He is the law of the first truth. But this is 
Christ's attribute as God. Consequently, judiciary power does not belong 
to Christ as man but as God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to judiciary power to reward the good, just 
as to punish the wicked. But eternal beatitude, which is the reward of 
good works, is bestowed by God alone: thus Augustine says (Tract. xxiii 
super Joan.) that "the soul is made blessed by participation of God, and 
not by participation of a holy soul."  Therefore it seems that judiciary 
power does not belong to Christ as man, but as God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it belongs to Christ's judiciary power to judge secrets 
of hearts, according to 1 Cor. 4:5: "Judge not before the time; until the 
Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, 
and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts." But this belongs 
exclusively to the Divine power, according to Jer. 17:9,10: "The heart of 
man is perverse and unsearchable, who can know it? I am the Lord who 
search the heart, and prove the reins: who give to every one according to 
his way." Therefore judiciary power does not belong to Christ as man but 
as God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++5:27">Jn. 5:27</a>): "He hath given Him power to do 
judgment, because He is the Son of man."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Chrysostom (Hom. xxxix in Joan.) seems to think that 
judiciary power belongs to Christ not as man, but only as God. 
Accordingly he thus explains the passage just quoted from John: "'He gave 
Him power to do judgment, because He is the Son of man: wonder not at 
this.' For He received judiciary power, not because He is man; but 
because He is the Son of the ineffable God, therefore is He judge. But 
since the expressions used were greater than those appertaining to man, 
He said in explanation: 'Wonder not at this, because He is the Son of 
man, for He is likewise the Son of God.'" And he proves this by the 
effect of the Resurrection: wherefore He adds: "Because the hour cometh 
when the dead in their graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But it must be observed that although the primary authority of judging 
rests with God, nevertheless the power to judge is committed to men with 
regard to those subject to their jurisdiction. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++1:16">Dt. 1:16</a>): "Judge that which is just"; and further on (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++1:17">Dt. 1:17</a>): "Because it 
is the judgment of God," that is to say, it is by His authority that you 
judge. Now it was said before (<A Href="TP008.html#TPQ8OUTP1">Question [8]</a>, <A Href="TP008.html#TPQ8ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4) that Christ even in His 
human nature is Head of the entire Church, and that God has "put all 
things under His feet." Consequently, it belongs to Him, even according 
to His human nature, to exercise judiciary power. on this account. it 
seems that the authority of Scripture quoted above must be interpreted 
thus: "He gave Him power to do judgment, because He is the Son of Man"; 
not on account of the condition of His nature, for thus all men would 
have this kind of power, as Chrysostom objects (Hom. xxxix in Joan.); but 
because this belongs to the grace of the Head, which Christ received in 
His human nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now judiciary power belongs to Christ in this way according to His human 
nature on three accounts. First, because of His likeness and kinship with 
men; for, as God works through intermediary causes, as being closer to 
the effects, so He judges men through the Man Christ, that His judgment 
may be sweeter to men. Hence (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++4:15">Heb. 4:15</a>) the Apostle says: "For we have 
not a high-priest, who cannot have compassion on our infirmities; but one 
tempted in all  things like as we are, without sin. Let us go therefore 
with confidence to the throne of His grace." Secondly, because at the 
last judgment, as Augustine says (Tract. xix in Joan.), "there will be a 
resurrection of dead bodies, which God will raise up through the Son of 
Man"; just as by "the same Christ He raises souls," inasmuch as "He is 
the Son of God." Thirdly, because, as Augustine observes (De Verb. Dom., 
Serm. cxxvii): "It was but right that those who were to be judged should 
see their judge. But those to be judged were the good and the bad. It 
follows that the form of a servant should be shown in the judgment to 
both good and wicked, while the form of God should be kept for the good 
alone."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Judgment belongs to truth as its standard, while it belongs 
to the man imbued with truth, according as he is as it were one with 
truth, as a kind of law and "living justice" [*Aristotle, Ethic. v]. 
Hence Augustine quotes (De Verb. Dom., Serm. cxxvii) the saying of 1 Cor. 
2:15: "The spiritual man judgeth all things." But beyond all creatures 
Christ's soul was more closely united with truth, and more full of truth; 
according to Jn. 1:14: "We saw Him . . . full of grace and truth." And 
according to this it belongs principally to the soul of Christ to judge 
all things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It belongs to God alone to bestow beatitude upon souls by a 
participation with Himself; but it is Christ's prerogative to bring them 
to such beatitude, inasmuch as He is their Head and the author of their 
salvation, according to Heb. 2:10: "Who had brought many children into 
glory, to perfect the author of their salvation by His Passion."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To know and judge the secrets of hearts, of itself belongs 
to God alone; but from the overflow of the Godhead into Christ's soul it 
belongs to Him also to know and to judge the secrets of hearts, as we 
stated above (<A Href="TP010.html#TPQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a>, <A Href="TP010.html#TPQ10A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), when dealing with the knowledge of Christ. 
Hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++2:16">Rm. 2:16</a>): "In the day when God shall judge the 
secrets of men by Jesus Christ."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ acquired His judiciary power by His merits?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ did not acquire His judiciary power by 
His merits. For judiciary power flows from the royal dignity: according 
to Prov. 20:8: "The king that sitteth on the throne of judgment, 
scattereth away all evil with his look." But it was without merits that 
Christ acquired royal power, for it is His due as God's Only-begotten 
Son: thus it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++1:32">Lk. 1:32</a>): "The Lord God shall give unto Him the 
throne of David His father, and He shall reign in the house of Jacob for 
ever." Therefore Christ did not obtain judiciary power by His merits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<A Href="TP059.html#TPQ59A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), judiciary power is Christ's due 
inasmuch as He is our Head. But the grace of headship does not belong to 
Christ by reason of merit, but follows the personal union of the Divine 
and human natures: according to Jn.  1:14,16: "We saw His glory . . . as 
of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth . . . and of 
His fulness we all have received": and this pertains to the notion of 
headship. Consequently, it seems that Christ did not have judiciary power 
from merits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++2:15">1 Cor. 2:15</a>): "The spiritual man 
judgeth all things." But a man becomes spiritual through grace, which is 
not from merits; otherwise it is "no more grace," as is said in Rm. 11:6. 
Therefore it seems that judiciary power belongs neither to Christ nor to 
others from any merits, but from grace alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Job+36:17">Job 36:17</a>): "Thy cause hath been judged 
as that of the wicked, cause and judgment thou shalt recover." And 
Augustine says (Serm. cxxvii): "The Judge shall sit, who stood before a 
judge; He shall condemn the truly wicked, who Himself was falsely reputed 
wicked."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There is nothing to hinder one and the same thing from 
being due to some one from various causes: as the glory of the body in 
rising was due to Christ not only as befitting His Godhead and His soul's 
glory, but likewise "from the merit of the lowliness of His Passion" 
[*Cf. Augustine, Tract. civ in Joan.]. And in the same way it must be 
said that judiciary power belongs to the Man Christ on account of both 
His Divine personality, and the dignity of His headship, and the fulness 
of His habitual grace: and yet He obtained it from merit, so that, in 
accordance with the Divine justice, He should be judge who fought for 
God's justice, and conquered, and was unjustly condemned. Hence He 
Himself says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rev+++3:21">Apoc. 3:21</a>): "I have overcome and am set down in My 
Father's throne [Vulg.: 'with My Father in His throne']." Now judiciary 
power is understood by "throne," according to Ps. 9:5: "Thou hast sat on 
the throne, who judgest justice."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument holds good of judiciary power according as it 
is due to Christ by reason of the union with the Word of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument is based on the ground of His grace as Head.
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument holds good in regard to habitual grace, which 
perfects Christ's soul. But although judiciary power be Christ's due in 
these ways, it is not hindered from being His due from merit.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether judiciary power belongs to Christ with respect to all human affairs?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that judiciary power concerning all human affairs 
does not belong to Christ. For as we read in Lk. 12:13,14, when one of 
the crowd said to Christ: "Speak to my brother that he  divide the 
inheritance with me; He said to him: Man, who hath appointed Me judge, or 
divider over you?" Consequently, He does not exercise judgment over all 
human affairs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one exercises judgment except over his own subjects. 
But, according to Heb. 2:8, "we see not as yet all things subject to" 
Christ. Therefore it seems that Christ has not judgment over all human 
affairs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xx) that it is part of 
Divine judgment for the good to be afflicted sometimes in this world, and 
sometimes to prosper, and in like manner the wicked. But the same was the 
case also before the Incarnation. Consequently, not all God's judgments 
regarding human affairs are included in Christ's judiciary power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++5:22">Jn. 5:22</a>): "The Father hath given all 
judgment to the Son."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[4] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> If we speak of Christ according to His Divine Nature, it 
is evident that every judgment of the Father belongs to the Son; for, as 
the Father does all things through His Word, so He judges all things 
through His Word.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[4] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we speak of Christ in His human nature, thus again is it evident 
that all things are subject to His judgment. This is made clear if we 
consider first of all the relationship subsisting between Christ's soul 
and the Word of God; for, if "the spiritual man judgeth all things," as 
is said in 1 Cor. 2:15, inasmuch as his soul clings to the Word of God, 
how much more Christ's soul, which is filled with the truth of the Word 
of God, passes judgment upon all things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[4] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the same appears from the merit of His death; because, 
according to Rm. 14:9: "To this end Christ died and rose again; that He 
might be Lord both of the dead and of the living." And therefore He has 
judgment over all men; and on this account the Apostle adds (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++14:10">Rm. 14:10</a>): 
"We shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ": and (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dan++7:14">Dan. 7:14</a>) 
it is written that "He gave Him power, and glory, and a kingdom; and all 
peoples, tribes, and tongues shall serve Him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[4] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the same thing is evident from comparison of human affairs with 
the end of human salvation. For, to whomsoever the substance is 
entrusted, the accessory is likewise committed. Now all human affairs are 
ordered for the end of beatitude, which is everlasting salvation, to 
which men are admitted, or from which they are excluded by Christ's 
judgment, as is evident from Mt. 25:31,40. Consequently, it is manifest 
that all human affairs are included in Christ's judiciary power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As was said above (<A Href="TP059.html#TPQ59A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, Objection [1]), judiciary power goes with 
royal dignity. Now Christ, although established king by God, did not wish 
while living on earth to govern temporarily an  earthly kingdom; 
consequently He said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++18:36">Jn. 18:36</a>): "My kingdom is not of this world." In 
like fashion He did not wish to exercise judiciary power over temporal 
concerns, since He came to raise men to Divine things. Hence Ambrose 
observes on this passage in Luke: "It is well that He who came down with 
a Divine purpose should hold Himself aloof from temporal concerns; nor 
does He deign to be a judge of quarrels and an arbiter of property, since 
He is judge of the quick and the dead, and the arbitrator of merits."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All things are subject to Christ in respect of that power, 
which He received from the Father, over all things, according to Mt. 
28:18: "All power is given to Me in heaven and in earth." But as to the 
exercise of this power, all things are not yet subject to Him: this will 
come to pass in the future, when He shall fulfil His will regarding all 
things, by saving some and punishing others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Judgments of this kind were exercised by Christ before His 
Incarnation, inasmuch as He is the Word of God: and the soul united with 
Him personally became a partaker of this power by the Incarnation.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether after the Judgment that takes place in the present time, there remains yet another General Judgment?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that after the Judgment that takes place in the 
present time, there does not remain another General Judgment. For a 
judgment serves no purpose after the final allotment of rewards and 
punishments. But rewards and punishments are allotted in this present 
time: for our Lord said to the thief on the cross (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++23:43">Lk. 23:43</a>): "This day 
thou shalt be with Me in paradise": and (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++16:22">Lk. 16:22</a>) it is said that "the 
rich man died and was buried in hell." Therefore it is useless to look 
forward to a final Judgment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to another (the Septuagint) version of Nahum 
1:9, "God shall not judge the same thing a second time." But in the 
present time God judges both temporal and spiritual matters. Therefore, 
it does not seem that another final judgment is to be expected.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, reward and punishment correspond with merit and demerit. 
But merit and demerit bear relation to the body only in so far as it is 
the instrument of the soul. Therefore reward or punishment is not due to 
the body save as the soul's instrument. Therefore no other Judgment is 
called for at the end (of the world) to requite man with reward or 
punishment in the body, besides that Judgment in which souls are now 
punished or rewarded.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said in Jn. 12:48: "The word that I have spoken, 
the same shall judge you [Vulg.: 'him'] in the last day." Therefore there 
will be a Judgment at the last day besides that which takes place in the 
present time. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[5] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Judgment cannot be passed perfectly upon any changeable 
subject before its consummation: just as judgment cannot be given 
perfectly regarding the quality of any action before its completion in 
itself and in its results: because many actions appear to be profitable, 
which in their effects prove to be hurtful. And in the same way perfect 
judgment cannot be passed upon any man before the close of his life, 
since he can be changed in many respects from good to evil, or 
conversely, or from good to better, or from evil to worse. Hence the 
Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++9:27">Heb. 9:27</a>): "It is appointed unto men once to die, and 
after this the Judgment."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[5] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But it must be observed that although man's temporal life in itself ends 
with death, still it continues dependent in a measure on what comes after 
it in the future. In one way, as it still lives on in men's memories, in 
which sometimes, contrary to the truth, good or evil reputations linger 
on. In another way in a man's children, who are so to speak something of 
their parent, according to Ecclus. 30:4: "His father is dead, and he is 
as if he were not dead, for he hath left one behind him that is like 
himself." And yet many good men have wicked sons, and conversely. 
Thirdly, as to the result of his actions: just as from the deceit of 
Arius and other false leaders unbelief continues to flourish down to the 
close of the world; and even until then faith will continue to derive its 
progress from the preaching of the apostles. In a fourth way, as to the 
body, which is sometimes buried with honor and sometimes left unburied, 
and finally falls to dust utterly. In a fifth way, as to the things upon 
which a man's heart is set, such as temporal concerns, for example, some 
of which quickly lapse, while others endure longer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[5] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all these things are submitted to the verdict of the Divine 
Judgment; and consequently, a perfect and public Judgment cannot be made 
of all these things during the course of this present time. Wherefore, 
there must be a final Judgment at the last day, in which everything 
concerning every man in every respect shall be perfectly and publicly 
judged.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some men have held the opinion that the souls of the saints 
shall not be rewarded in heaven, nor the souls of the lost punished in 
hell, until the Judgment-day. That this is false appears from the 
testimony of the Apostle (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Cor++5:8">2 Cor. 5:8</a>), where he says: "We are confident 
and have a good will to be absent rather from the body, and to be present 
with the Lord": that is, not to "walk by faith" but "by sight," as 
appears from the context. But this is to see God in His Essence, wherein 
consists "eternal life," as is clear from Jn. 17:3. Hence it is manifest 
that the souls separated from bodies are in eternal life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, it must be maintained that after death man enters into an 
unchangeable state as to all that concerns the soul: and therefore there 
is no need for postponing judgment as to the reward of the soul. But 
since there are some other things  pertaining to a man which go on 
through the whole course of time, and which are not foreign to the Divine 
judgment, all these things must be brought to judgment at the end of 
time. For although in regard to such things a man neither merits nor 
demerits, still in a measure they accompany his reward or punishment. 
Consequently all these things must be weighed in the final judgment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> "God shall not judge twice the same thing," i.e. in the 
same respect; but it is not unseemly for God to judge twice according to 
different respects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the reward or punishment of the body depends upon 
the reward or punishment of the soul, nevertheless, since the soul is 
changeable only accidentally, on account of the body, once it is 
separated from the body it enters into an unchangeable condition, and 
receives its judgment. But the body remains subject to change down to the 
close of time: and therefore it must receive its reward or punishment 
then, in the last Judgment.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ's judiciary power extends to the angels?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's judiciary power does not extend to 
the angels, because the good and wicked angels alike were judged in the 
beginning of the world, when some fell through sin while others were 
confirmed in bliss. But those already judged have no need of being judged 
again. Therefore Christ's judiciary power does not extend to the angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the same person cannot be both judge and judged. But the 
angels will come to judge with Christ, according to Mt. 25:31: "When the 
Son of Man shall come in His majesty, and all the angels with Him." 
Therefore it seems that the angels will not be judged by Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the angels are higher than other creatures. If Christ, 
then, be judge not only of men but likewise of angels, then for the same 
reason He will be judge of all creatures; which seems to be false, since 
this belongs to God's providence: hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Job+34:13">Job 34:13</a>): "What 
other hath He appointed over the earth? or whom hath He set over the 
world which He made?" Therefore Christ is not the judge of the angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++6:3">1 Cor. 6:3</a>): "Know you not that we 
shall judge angels?" But the saints judge only by Christ's authority. 
Therefore, much more does Christ possess judiciary power over the angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The angels are subjects of Christ's judiciary power, not 
only with regard to His Divine Nature, as He is the Word of God, but also 
with regard to His human nature. And this is evident from three 
considerations. First of all, from the closeness of His assumed nature to 
God; because, according to Heb. 2:16: "For  nowhere doth He take hold of 
the angels, but of the seed of Abraham He taketh hold." Consequently, 
Christ's soul is more filled with the truth of the Word of God than any 
angel: for which reason He also enlightens the angels, as Dionysius says 
(Coel. Hier. vii), and so He has power to judge them. Secondly, because 
by the lowliness of His Passion, human nature in Christ merited to be 
exalted above the angels; so that, as is said in Phil. 2:10: "In the name 
of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, 
and under the earth." And therefore Christ has judiciary power even over 
the good and wicked angels: in token whereof it is said in the Apocalypse 
(7:11) that "all the angels stood round about the throne." Thirdly, on 
account of what they do for men, of whom Christ is the Head in a special 
manner. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++1:14">Heb. 1:14</a>): "They are [Vulg.: 'Are they 
not'] all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them, who shall 
receive the inheritance of salvation (?)." But they are submitted to 
Christ's judgment, first, as regards the dispensing of those things which 
are done through them; which dispensing is likewise done by the Man 
Christ, to whom the angels ministered, as related (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++4:11">Mt. 4:11</a>), and from 
whom the devils besought that they might be sent into the swine, 
according to Mt. 8:31. Secondly, as to other accidental rewards of the 
good angels, such as the joy which they have at the salvation of men, 
according to Lk. 15:10: "There shall be joy before the angels of God upon 
one sinner doing penance": and furthermore as to the accidental 
punishments of the devils wherewith they are either tormented here, or 
are shut up in hell; and this also belongs to the Man Christ: hence it is 
written (Mk. 1:24) that the devil cried out: "What have we to do with 
thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art Thou come to destroy us?" Thirdly, as to the 
essential reward of the good angels, which is everlasting bliss; and as 
to the essential punishment of the wicked angels, which is everlasting 
damnation. But this was done by Christ from the beginning of the world, 
inasmuch as He is the Word of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument considers judgment as to the essential reward 
and chief punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xxxi): "Although the 
spiritual man judgeth all things, still he is judged by Truth Itself." 
Consequently, although the angels judge, as being spiritual creatures, 
still they are judged by Christ, inasmuch as He is the Truth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ judges not only the angels, but also the 
administration of all creatures. For if, as Augustine says (De Trin. iii) 
the lower things are ruled by God through the higher, in a certain order, 
it must be said that all things are ruled by Christ's soul, which is 
above every creature. Hence the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++2:5">Heb. 2:5</a>): "For God hath 
not subjected unto angels the world to come"---subject namely to 
Christ---"of whom we speak" [Douay: 'whereof we speak'] [*The words 
"subject namely to Christ" are from a gloss]. Nor does it follow that God 
set another over the earth; since one and the same Person is God and Man, 
our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[59] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Let what has been said of the Mystery of His Incarnation suffice for the
