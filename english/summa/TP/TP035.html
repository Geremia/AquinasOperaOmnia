<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After considering Christ's conception, we must treat of His nativity. 
First, as to the nativity itself; secondly, as to His manifestation after 
birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the first there are eight points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP035.html#TPQ35A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether nativity regards the nature or the person?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP035.html#TPQ35A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether another, besides His eternal, birth should be attributed to 
Christ?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP035.html#TPQ35A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the Blessed Virgin is His Mother in respect of His temporal 
birth?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP035.html#TPQ35A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether she ought to be called the Mother of God?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP035.html#TPQ35A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether Christ is the Son of God the Father and of the Virgin Mother 
in respect of two filiations?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP035.html#TPQ35A6THEP1">(6)</a> Of the mode of the Nativity;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP035.html#TPQ35A7THEP1">(7)</a> Of its place;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP035.html#TPQ35A8THEP1">(8)</a> Of the time of the Nativity.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether nativity regards the nature rather than the person?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that nativity regards the nature rather than the 
person. For Augustine [*Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Petrum): "The 
eternal Divine Nature could not be conceived and born of human nature, 
except in a true human nature." Consequently it becomes the Divine Nature 
to be conceived and born by reason of the human nature. Much more, 
therefore, does it regard human nature itself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Metaph. v), "nature" is so 
denominated from "nativity." But things are denominated from one another 
by reason of some likeness. Therefore it seems that nativity regards the 
nature rather than the person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, properly speaking, that is born which begins to exist by 
nativity. But Christ's Person did not begin to exist by His nativity, 
whereas His human nature did. Therefore it seems that the nativity 
properly regards the nature, and not the person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii): "Nativity regards 
the hypostasis, not the nature."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Nativity can be attributed to someone in two ways: first, 
as to its subject; secondly, as to its terminus. To him that is born it 
is attributed as to its subject: and this, properly speaking, is the 
hypostasis, not the nature. For since to be born is to be generated; as a 
thing is generated in order for it to be, so is a thing born in order for 
it to be. Now, to be, properly speaking, belongs to that which subsists; 
since a form that does not subsist is said to be only inasmuch as by it 
something is: and whereas person or hypostasis designates something as 
subsisting, nature designates form, whereby something subsists. 
Consequently, nativity is attributed to the person or hypostasis as  to 
the proper subject of being born, but not to the nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But to the nature nativity is attributed as to its terminus. For the 
terminus of generation and of every nativity is the form. Now, nature 
designates something as a form: wherefore nativity is said to be "the 
road to nature," as the Philosopher states (Phys. ii): for the purpose of 
nature is terminated in the form or nature of the species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> On account of the identity of nature and hypostasis in God, 
nature fs sometimes put instead of person or hypostasis. And in this 
sense Augustine says that the Divine Nature was conceived and born, 
inasmuch as the Person of the Son was conceived and born in the human 
nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> No movement or change is denominated from the subject 
moved, but from the terminus of the movement, whence the subject has its 
species. For this reason nativity is not denominated from the person 
born, but from nature, which is the terminus of nativity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Nature, properly speaking, does not begin to exist: rather 
is it the person that begins to exist in some nature. Because, as stated 
above, nature designates that by which something is; whereas person 
designates something as having subsistent being.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a temporal nativity should be attributed to Christ?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that temporal nativity is not to be attributed to 
Christ. For "to be born is a certain movement of a thing that did not 
exist before it was born, which movement procures for it the benefit of 
existence" [*Cf. Augustine, De Unit. Trin. xii]. But Christ was from all 
eternity. Therefore He could not be born in time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what is perfect in itself needs not to be born. But the 
Person of the Son of God was perfect from eternity. Therefore He needs 
not to be born in time. Therefore it seems that He had no temporal birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, properly speaking, nativity regards the person. But in 
Christ there is only one person. Therefore in Christ there is but one 
nativity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, what is born by two nativities is born twice. But this 
proposition is false; "Christ was born twice": because the nativity 
whereby He was born of the Father suffers no interruption; since it is 
eternal. Whereas interruption is required to warrant the use of the 
adverb "twice": for a man is said to run twice whose running is 
interrupted. Therefore it seems that we should not admit a double 
nativity in Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii): "We  confess two 
nativities in Christ: one of the Father---eternal; and one which occurred 
in these latter times for our sake."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP035.html#TPQ35A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), nature is compared to nativity, 
as the terminus to movement or change. Now, movement is diversified 
according to the diversity of its termini, as the Philosopher shows 
(Phys. v). But, in Christ there is a twofold nature: one which He 
received of the Father from eternity, the other which He received from 
His Mother in time. Therefore we must needs attribute to Christ a twofold 
nativity: one by which He was born of the Father from all eternity; one 
by which He was born of His Mother in time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This was the argument of a certain heretic, Felician, and 
is solved thus by Augustine (Contra Felic. xii). "Let us suppose," says 
he, "as many maintain, that in the world there is a universal soul, 
which, by its ineffable movement, so gives life to all seed, that it is 
not compounded with things begotten, but bestows life that they may be 
begotten. Without doubt, when this soul reaches the womb, being intent on 
fashioning the passible matter to its own purpose, it unites itself to 
the personality thereof, though manifestly it is not of the same 
substance; and thus of the active soul and passive matter, one man is 
made out of two substances. And so we confess that the soul is born from 
out the womb; but not as though, before birth, it was nothing at all in 
itself. Thus, then, but in a way much more sublime, the Son of God was 
born as man, just as the soul is held to be born together with the body: 
not as though they both made one substance, but that from both, one 
person results. Yet we do not say that the Son of God began thus to 
exist: lest it be thought that His Divinity is temporal. Nor do we 
acknowledge the flesh of the Son of God to have been from eternity: lest 
it be thought that He took, not a true human body, but some resemblance 
thereof."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This was an argument of Nestorius, and it is thus solved by 
Cyril in an epistle [*Cf. Acta Concil. Ephes., p. 1, cap. viii]: "We do 
not say that the Son of God had need, for His own sake, of a second 
nativity, after that which is from the Father: for it is foolish and a 
mark of ignorance to say that He who is from all eternity, and co-eternal 
with the Father, needs to begin again to exist. But because for us and 
for our salvation, uniting the human nature to His Person, He became the 
child of a woman, for this reason do we say that He was born in the 
flesh."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Nativity regards the person as its subject, the nature as 
its terminus. Now, it is possible for several transformations to be in 
the same subject: yet must they be diversified in respect of their 
termini. But we do not say this as though the eternal nativity were a 
transformation or a movement, but because it is designated by way of a 
transformation or movement.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Christ can be said to have been born twice in respect of 
His two nativities. For just as he is said to run twice  who runs at two 
different times, so can He be said to be born twice who is born once from 
eternity and once in time: because eternity and time differ much more 
than two different times, although each signifies a measure of duration.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the Blessed Virgin can be called Christ's Mother in respect of His temporal nativity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Blessed Virgin cannot be called Christ's 
Mother in respect of His temporal nativity. For, as stated above (<A Href="TP032.html#TPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="TP032.html#TPQ32A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the Blessed Virgin Mary did not cooperate actively in begetting 
Christ, but merely supplied the matter. But this does not seem sufficient 
to make her His Mother: otherwise wood might be called the mother of the 
bed or bench. Therefore it seems that the Blessed Virgin cannot be called 
the Mother of Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ was born miraculously of the Blessed Virgin. But 
a miraculous begetting does not suffice for motherhood or sonship: for we 
do not speak of Eve as being the daughter of Adam. Therefore neither 
should Christ be called the Son of the Blessed Virgin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, motherhood seems to imply partial separation of the 
semen. But, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii), "Christ's body was 
formed, not by a seminal process, but by the operation of the Holy 
Ghost." Therefore it seems that the Blessed Virgin should not be called 
the Mother of Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++1%3A18">Mt. 1:18</a>): "The generation of Christ was 
in this wise. When His Mother Mary was espoused to Joseph," etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The Blessed Virgin Mary is in truth and by nature the 
Mother of Christ. For, as we have said above (<A Href="TP005.html#TPQ5OUTP1">Question [5]</a>, <A Href="TP005.html#TPQ5A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31OUTP1">Question [31]</a>, <A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), 
Christ's body was not brought down from heaven, as the heretic Valentine 
maintained, but was taken from the Virgin Mother, and formed from her 
purest blood. And this is all that is required for motherhood, as has 
been made clear above (<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31OUTP1">Question [31]</a>, <A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="TP032.html#TPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="TP032.html#TPQ32A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore the Blessed 
Virgin is truly Christ's Mother.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP032.html#TPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="TP032.html#TPQ32A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), not every generation implies 
fatherhood or motherhood and sonship, but only the generation of living 
things. Consequently when inanimate things are made from some matter, the 
relationship of motherhood and sonship does not follow from this, but 
only in the generation of living things, which is properly called 
nativity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii): "The temporal 
nativity by which Christ was born for our salvation is, in a way, 
natural, since a Man was born of a woman, and after the due lapse of time 
from His conception: but it is also supernatural, because He was 
begotten, not of seed, but of the Holy Ghost and the Blessed Virgin, 
above the law of conception." Thus, then, on the  part of the mother, 
this nativity was natural, but on the part of the operation of the Holy 
Ghost it was supernatural. Therefore the Blessed Virgin is the true and 
natural Mother of Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31OUTP1">Question [31]</a>, <A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="TP032.html#TPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="TP032.html#TPQ32A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the 
resolution of the woman's semen is not necessary for conception; neither, 
therefore, is it required for motherhood.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the Blessed Virgin should be called the Mother of God?<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Blessed Virgin should not be called the 
Mother of God. For in the Divine mysteries we should not make any 
assertion that is not taken from Holy Scripture. But we read nowhere in 
Holy Scripture that she is the mother or parent of God, but that she is 
the "mother of Christ" or of "the Child," as may be seen from Mt. 1:18. 
Therefore we should not say that the Blessed Virgin is the Mother of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ is called God in respect of His Divine Nature. 
But the Divine Nature did not first originate from the Virgin. Therefore 
the Blessed Virgin should not be called the Mother of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the word "God" is predicated in common of Father, Son, 
and Holy Ghost. If, therefore, the Blessed Virgin is Mother of God it 
seems to follow that she was the Mother of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, 
which cannot be allowed. Therefore the Blessed Virgin should not be 
called Mother of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In the chapters of Cyril, approved in the Council of 
Ephesus (P. 1, Cap. xxvi), we read: "If anyone confess not that the 
Emmanuel is truly God, and that for this reason the Holy Virgin is the 
Mother of God, since she begot of her flesh the Word of God made flesh, 
let him be anathema."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP016.html#TPQ16OUTP1">Question [16]</a>, <A Href="TP016.html#TPQ16A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), every word that signifies 
a nature in the concrete can stand for any hypostasis of that nature. 
Now, since the union of the Incarnation took place in the hypostasis, as 
above stated (<A Href="TP002.html#TPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="TP002.html#TPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), it is manifest that this word "God" can stand 
for the hypostasis, having a human and a Divine nature. Therefore 
whatever belongs to the Divine and to the human nature can be attributed 
to that Person: both when a word is employed to stand for it, signifying 
the Divine Nature, and when a word is used signifying the human nature. 
Now, conception and birth are attributed to the person and hypostasis in 
respect of that nature in which it is conceived and born. Since, 
therefore, the human nature was taken by the Divine Person in the very 
beginning of the conception, as stated above (<A Href="TP033.html#TPQ33OUTP1">Question [33]</a>, <A Href="TP033.html#TPQ33A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), it follows 
that it can be truly said that God was conceived and born of the Virgin. 
Now from this is a woman called a man's mother, that she conceived him 
and gave birth to him. Therefore the Blessed Virgin is truly called the 
Mother of God. For the only way in which it could be denied that the 
Blessed Virgin is the Mother of God would be either  if the humanity were 
first subject to conception and birth, before this man were the Son of 
God, as Photinus said; or if the humanity were not assumed unto unity of 
the Person or hypostasis of the Word of God, as Nestorius maintained. But 
both of these are erroneous. Therefore it is heretical to deny that the 
Blessed Virgin is the Mother of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This was an argument of Nestorius, and it is solved by 
saying that, although we do not find it said expressly in Scripture that 
the Blessed Virgin is the Mother of God, yet we do find it expressly said 
in Scripture that "Jesus Christ is true God," as may be seen 1 Jn. 5:20, 
and that the Blessed Virgin is the "Mother of Jesus Christ," which is 
clearly expressed Mt. 1:18. Therefore, from the words of Scripture it 
follows of necessity that she is the Mother of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++9%3A5">Rm. 9:5</a>) that Christ is of the Jews "according to 
the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever." But He is not 
of the Jews except through the Blessed Virgin. Therefore He who is "above 
all things, God blessed for ever," is truly born of the Blessed Virgin as 
of His Mother.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This was an argument of Nestorius. But Cyril, in a letter 
against Nestorius [*Cf. Acta Conc. Ephes., p. 1, cap. ii], answers it 
thus: "Just as when a man's soul is born with its body, they are 
considered as one being: and if anyone wish to say that the mother of the 
flesh is not the mother of the soul, he says too much. Something like 
this may be perceived in the generation of Christ. For the Word of God 
was born of the substance of God the Father: but because He took flesh, 
we must of necessity confess that in the flesh He was born of a woman." 
Consequently we must say that the Blessed Virgin is called the Mother of 
God, not as though she were the Mother of the Godhead, but because she is 
the mother, according to His human nature, of the Person who has both the 
divine and the human nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the name "God" is common to the three Persons, yet 
sometimes it stands for the Person of the Father alone, sometimes only 
for the Person of the Son or of the Holy Ghost, as stated above (<A Href="TP016.html#TPQ16OUTP1">Question [16]</a>, <A Href="TP016.html#TPQ16A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP039.html#FPQ39OUTP1">Question [39]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP039.html#FPQ39A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). So that when we say, "The Blessed Virgin is the 
Mother of God," this word "God" stands only for the incarnate Person of 
the Son.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether there are two filiations in Christ?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are two filiations in Christ. For 
nativity is the cause of filiation. But in Christ there are two 
nativities. Therefore in Christ there are also two filiations.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, filiation, which is said of a man as being the son of 
someone, his father or his mother, depends, in a way, on him: because the 
very being of a relation consists "in being referred to another"; 
wherefore if one of two relatives be  destroyed, the other is destroyed 
also. But the eternal filiation by which Christ is the Son of God the 
Father depends not on His Mother, because nothing eternal depends on what 
is temporal. Therefore Christ is not His Mother's Son by temporal 
filiation. Either, therefore, He is not her Son at all, which is in 
contradiction to what has been said above (<A Href="TP035.html#TPQ35ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), or He must needs be 
her Son by some other temporal filiation. Therefore in Christ there are 
two filiations.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one of two relatives enters the definition of the other; 
hence it is clear that of two relatives, one is specified from the other. 
But one and the same cannot be in diverse species. Therefore it seems 
impossible that one and the same relation be referred to extremes which 
are altogether diverse. But Christ is said to be the Son of the Eternal 
Father and a temporal mother, who are terms altogether diverse. Therefore 
it seems that Christ cannot, by the same relation, be called the Son of 
the Father and of His Mother Therefore in Christ there are two filiations.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> As Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii), things 
pertaining to the nature are multiple in Christ; but not those things 
that pertain to the Person. But filiation belongs especially to the 
Person, since it is a personal property, as appears from what was said in 
the FP, Question [32], Article [3]; FP, Question [40], Article [2]. Therefore there is but one 
filiation in Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[5] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> opinions differ on this question. For some, considering 
only the cause of filiation, which is nativity, put two filiations in 
Christ, just as there are two nativities. On the contrary, others, 
considering only the subject of filiation, which is the person or 
hypostasis, put only one filiation in Christ, just as there is but one 
hypostasis or person. Because the unity or plurality of a relation is 
considered in respect, not of its terms, but of its cause or of its 
subject. For if it were considered in respect of its terms, every man 
would of necessity have in himself two filiations---one in reference to 
his father, and another in reference to his mother. But if we consider 
the question aright, we shall see that every man bears but one relation 
to both his father and his mother, on account of the unity of the cause 
thereof. For man is born by one birth of both father and mother: whence 
he bears but one relation to both. The same is said of one master who 
teaches many disciples the same doctrine, and of one lord who governs 
many subjects by the same power. But if there be various causes 
specifically diverse, it seems that in consequence the relations differ 
in species: wherefore nothing hinders several such relations being in the 
same subject. Thus if a man teach grammar to some and logic to others, 
his teaching is of a different kind in one case and in the other; and 
therefore one and the same man may have different relations as the master 
of different disciples, or of the same disciples in regard to diverse 
doctrines. Sometimes, however, it happens that a man bears a relation to 
several in respect of various causes, but of the same species: thus a 
father may have several sons by several acts of generation. Wherefore the 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; paternity cannot differ specifically, since the acts of generation are 
specifically the same. And because several forms of the same species 
cannot at the same time be in the same subject, it is impossible for 
several paternities to be in a man who is the father of several sons by 
natural generation. But it would not be so were he the father of one son 
by natural generation and of another by adoption.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[5] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, it is manifest that Christ was not born by one and the same 
nativity, of the Father from eternity, and of His Mother in time: indeed, 
these two nativities differ specifically. Wherefore, as to this, we must 
say that there are various filiations, one temporal and the other 
eternal. Since, however, the subject of filiation is neither the nature 
nor part of the nature, but the person or hypostasis alone; and since in 
Christ there is no other hypostasis or person than the eternal, there can 
be no other filiation in Christ but that which is in the eternal 
hypostasis. Now, every relation which is predicated of God from time does 
not put something real in the eternal God, but only something according 
to our way of thinking, as we have said in the FP, Question [13], Article [7]. Therefore 
the filiation by which Christ is referred to His Mother cannot be a real 
relation, but only a relation of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[5] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently each opinion is true to a certain extent. For if we 
consider the adequate causes of filiation, we must needs say that there 
are two filiations in respect of the twofold nativity. But if we consider 
the subject of filiation, which can only be the eternal suppositum, then 
no other than the eternal filiation in Christ is a real relation. 
Nevertheless, He has the relation of Son in regard to His Mother, because 
it is implied in the relation of motherhood to Christ. Thus God is called 
Lord by a relation which is implied in the real relation by which the 
creature is subject to God. And although lordship is not a real relation 
in God, yet is He really Lord through the real subjection of the creature 
to Him. In the same way Christ is really the Son of the Virgin Mother 
through the real relation of her motherhood to Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Temporal nativity would cause a real temporal filiation in 
Christ if there were in Him a subject capable of such filiation. But this 
cannot be; since the eternal suppositum cannot be receptive of a temporal 
relation, as stated above. Nor can it be said that it is receptive of 
temporal filiation by reason of the human nature, just as it is receptive 
of the temporal nativity; because human nature would need in some way to 
be the subject of filiation, just as in a way it is the subject of 
nativity; for since an Ethiopian is said to be white by reason of his 
teeth, it must be that his teeth are the subject of whiteness. But human 
nature can nowise be the subject of filiation, because this relation 
regards directly the person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Eternal filiation does not depend on a temporal mother, but 
together with this eternal filiation we understand a certain temporal 
relation dependent on the mother, in respect of which relation Christ is 
called the Son of His Mother. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> One and being are mutually consequent, as is said Metaph. 
iv. Therefore, just as it happens that in one of the extremes of a 
relation there is something real, whereas in the other there is not 
something real, but merely a certain aspect, as the Philosopher observes 
of knowledge and the thing known; so also it happens that on the part of 
one extreme there is one relation, whereas on the part of the other there 
are many. Thus in man on the part of his parents there is a twofold 
relation, the one of paternity, the other of motherhood, which are 
specifically diverse, inasmuch as the father is the principle of 
generation in one way, and the mother in another (whereas if many be the 
principle of one action and in the same way---for instance, if many. 
together draw a ship along---there would be one and the same relation in 
all of them); but on the part of the child there is but one filiation in 
reality, though there be two in aspect, corresponding to the two 
relations in the parents, as considered by the intellect. And thus in one 
way there is only one real filiation in Christ, which is in respect of 
the Eternal Father: yet there is another temporal relation in regard to 
His temporal mother.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ was not born without His Mother 
suffering. For just as man's death was a result of the sin of our first 
parents, according to Gn. 2:17: "In what day soever ye shall eat, ye 
shall [Vulg.: 'thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt] die"; so were the pains 
of childbirth, according to Gn. 3:16: "In sorrow shalt thou bring forth 
children." But Christ was willing to undergo death. Therefore for the 
same reason it seems that His birth should have been with pain.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the end is proportionate to the beginning. But Christ 
ended His life in pain, according to Is. 53:4: "Surely . . . He hath 
carried our sorrows." Therefore it seems that His nativity was not 
without the pains of childbirth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the book on the birth of our Saviour [*Protevangelium 
Jacobi xix, xx] it is related that midwives were present at Christ's 
birth; and they would be wanted by reason of the mother's suffering pain. 
Therefore it seems that the Blessed Virgin suffered pain in giving birth 
to her Child.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Serm. de Nativ. [*Supposititious]), 
addressing himself to the Virgin-Mother: "In conceiving thou wast all 
pure, in giving birth thou wast without pain."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The pains of childbirth are caused by the infant opening 
the passage from the womb. Now it has been said above (<A Href="TP028.html#TPQ28OUTP1">Question [28]</a>, <A Href="TP028.html#TPQ28A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, Replies to objections), that Christ came forth from the closed womb of 
His Mother, and, consequently, without opening the passage. Consequently 
there was no pain in that birth, as  neither was there any corruption; on 
the contrary, there was much joy therein for that God-Man "was born into 
the world," according to Is. 35:1,2: "Like the lily, it shall bud forth 
and blossom, and shall rejoice with joy and praise."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The pains of childbirth in the woman follow from the 
mingling of the sexes. Wherefore (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++3%3A16">Gn. 3:16</a>) after the words, "in sorrow 
shalt thou bring forth children," the following are added: "and thou 
shalt be under thy husband's power." But, as Augustine says (Serm. de 
Assumpt. B. Virg., [*Supposititious]), from this sentence we must exclude 
the Virgin-Mother of God; who, "because she conceived Christ without the 
defilement of sin, and without the stain of sexual mingling, therefore 
did she bring Him forth without pain, without violation of her virginal 
integrity, without detriment to the purity of her maidenhood." Christ, 
indeed, suffered death, but through His own spontaneous desire, in order 
to atone for us, not as a necessary result of that sentence, for He was 
not a debtor unto death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As "by His death" Christ "destroyed our death" [*Preface of 
the Mass in Paschal-time], so by His pains He freed us from our pains; 
and so He wished to die a painful death. But the mother's pains in 
childbirth did not concern Christ, who came to atone for our sins. And 
therefore there was no need for His Mother to suffer in giving birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> We are told (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++2%3A7">Lk. 2:7</a>) that the Blessed Virgin herself 
"wrapped up in swaddling clothes" the Child whom she had brought forth, 
"and laid Him in a manger." Consequently the narrative of this book, 
which is apocryphal, is untrue. Wherefore Jerome says (Adv. Helvid. iv): 
"No midwife was there, no officious women interfered. She was both mother 
and midwife. 'With swaddling clothes,' says he, 'she wrapped up the 
child, and laid Him in a manger.'" These words prove the falseness of the 
apocryphal ravings.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ should not have been born in Bethlehem. 
For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++2%3A3">Is. 2:3</a>): "The law shall come forth from Sion, and the 
Word of the Lord from Jerusalem." But Christ is truly the Word of God. 
Therefore He should have come into the world at Jerusalem.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++2%3A23">Mt. 2:23</a>) that it is written of Christ that 
"He shall be called a Nazarene"; which is taken from Is. 11:1: "A flower 
shall rise up out of his root"; for "Nazareth" is interpreted "a flower." 
But a man is named especially from the place of his birth. Therefore it 
seems that He should have been born in Nazareth, where also He was 
conceived and brought up.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, for this was our Lord born into the world, that He might 
make known the true faith. according to Jn. 18:37:  "For this was I born, 
and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the 
truth." But this would have been easier if He had been born in the city 
of Rome, which at that time ruled the world; whence Paul, writing to the 
Romans (1:8) says: "Your faith is spoken of in the whole world." 
Therefore it seems that He should not have been born in Bethlehem.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Mich. 5:2): "And thou, Bethlehem, 
Ephrata . . . out of thee shall He come forth unto Me, that is to be the 
ruler in Israel."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Christ willed to be born in Bethlehem for two reasons. 
First, because "He was made . . . of the seed of David according to the 
flesh," as it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A3">Rm. 1:3</a>); to whom also was a special promise 
made concerning Christ; according to 2 Kgs. 23:1: "The man to whom it was 
appointed concerning the Christ of the God of Jacob . . . said." 
Therefore He willed to be born at Bethlehem, where David was born, in 
order that by the very birthplace the promise made to David might be 
shown to be fulfilled. The Evangelist points this out by saying: "Because 
He was of the house and of the family of David." Secondly, because, as 
Gregory says (Hom. viii in Evang.): "Bethlehem is interpreted 'the house 
of bread.' It is Christ Himself who said, 'I am the living Bread which 
came down from heaven.'"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As David was born in Bethlehem, so also did he choose 
Jerusalem to set up his throne there, and to build there the Temple of 
God, so that Jerusalem was at the same time a royal and a priestly city. 
Now, Christ's priesthood and kingdom were "consummated" principally in 
His Passion. Therefore it was becoming that He should choose Bethlehem 
for His Birthplace and Jerusalem for the scene of His Passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, too, He put to silence the vain boasting of men who 
take pride in being born in great cities, where also they desire 
especially to receive honor. Christ, on the contrary, willed to be born 
in a mean city, and to suffer reproach in a great city.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ wished "to flower" by His holy life, not in His 
carnal birth. Therefore He wished to be fostered and brought up at 
Nazareth. But He wished to be born at Bethlehem away from home; because, 
as Gregory says (Hom. viii in Evang.), through the human nature which He 
had taken, He was born, as it were, in a foreign place---foreign not to 
His power, but to His Nature. And, again, as Bede says on Lk. 2:7: "In 
order that He who found no room at the inn might prepare many mansions 
for us in His Father's house."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> According to a sermon in the Council of Ephesus [*P. iii, 
cap. ix]: "If He had chosen the great city of Rome, the change in the 
world would be ascribed to the influence of her citizens. If He had been 
the son of the Emperor, His benefits would have been attributed to the 
latter's power. But that we might acknowledge the work of God in the 
transformation of the whole  earth, He chose a poor mother and a 
birthplace poorer still."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that He may confound 
the strong" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++1%3A27">1 Cor. 1:27</a>). And therefore, in order the more to show His 
power, He set up the head of His Church in Rome itself, which was the 
head of the world, in sign of His complete victory, in order that from 
that city the faith might spread throughout the world; according to Is. 
26:5,6: "The high city He shall lay low . . . the feet of the poor," i.e. 
of Christ, "shall tread it down; the steps of the needy," i.e. of the 
apostles Peter and Paul.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ was not born at a fitting time. Because 
Christ came in order to restore liberty to His own. But He was born at a 
time of subjection---namely, when the whole world, as it were, tributary 
to Augustus, was being enrolled, at his command as Luke relates (2:1). 
Therefore it seems that Christ was not born at a fitting time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the promises concerning the coming of Christ were not 
made to the Gentiles; according to Rm. 9:4: "To whom belong . . . the 
promises." But Christ was born during the reign of a foreigner, as 
appears from Mt. 2:1: "When Jesus was born in the days of King Herod." 
Therefore it seems that He was not born at a fitting time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the time of Christ's presence on earth is compared to 
the day, because He is the "Light of the world"; wherefore He says 
Himself (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++9%3A4">Jn. 9:4</a>): "I must work the works of Him that sent Me, whilst it 
is day." But in summer the days are longer than in winter. Therefore, 
since He was born in the depth of winter, eight days before the Kalends 
of January, it seems that He was not born at a fitting time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++4%3A4">Gal. 4:4</a>): "When the fulness of the time 
was come, God sent His Son, made of a woman, made under the law."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There is this difference between Christ and other men, 
that, whereas they are born subject to the restrictions of time, Christ, 
as Lord and Maker of all time, chose a time in which to be born, just as 
He chose a mother and a birthplace. And since "what is of God is well 
ordered" and becomingly arranged, it follows that Christ was born at a 
most fitting time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ came in order to bring us back from a state of 
bondage to a state of liberty. And therefore, as He took our mortal 
nature in order to restore us to life, so, as Bede says (Super Luc. ii, 
4,5), "He deigned to take flesh at such a time that, shortly after His 
birth, He would be enrolled in Caesar's census, and thus submit Himself 
to bondage for the sake of our  liberty."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, at that time, when the whole world lived under one ruler, 
peace abounded on the earth. Therefore it was a fitting time for the 
birth of Christ, for "He is our peace, who hath made both one," as it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++2%3A14">Eph. 2:14</a>). Wherefore Jerome says on Is. 2:4: "If we search the 
page of ancient history, we shall find that throughout the whole world 
there was discord until the twenty-eighth year of Augustus Caesar: but 
when our Lord was born, all war ceased"; according to Is. 2:4: "Nation 
shall not lift up sword against nation."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, it was fitting that Christ should be born while the world was 
governed by one ruler, because "He came to gather His own [Vulg.: 'the 
children of God'] together in one" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++11%3A52">Jn. 11:52</a>), that there might be "one 
fold and one shepherd" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++10%3A16">Jn. 10:16</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ wished to be born during the reign of a foreigner, 
that the prophecy of Jacob might be fulfilled (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++49%3A10">Gn. 49:10</a>): "The sceptre 
shall not be taken away from Juda, nor a ruler from his thigh, till He 
come that is to be sent." Because, as Chrysostom says (Hom. ii in Matth. 
[*Opus Imperf., falsely ascribed to Chrysostom]), as long as the Jewish 
"people was governed by Jewish kings, however wicked, prophets were sent 
for their healing. But now that the Law of God is under the power of a 
wicked king, Christ is born; because a grave and hopeless disease 
demanded a more skilful physician."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As says the author of the book De Qq. Nov. et Vet. Test., 
"Christ wished to be born, when the light of day begins to increase in 
length," so as to show that He came in order that man might come nearer 
to the Divine Light, according to Lk. 1:79: "To enlighten them that sit 
in darkness and in the shadow of death."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[35] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner He chose to be born in the rough winter season, that He 
might begin from then to suffer in body for us.<br>
