  <h3 align="center">OF CHRIST'S PRAYER (FOUR ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider Christ's prayer; and under this head there are four
    points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP021.html#TPQ21A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is becoming that Christ
    should pray?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP021.html#TPQ21A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it pertains to Him in
    respect of His sensuality?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP021.html#TPQ21A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is becoming to Him to
    pray for Himself or only for others?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP021.html#TPQ21A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether every prayer of His was
    heard?

  <h3 align="left">Whether it is becoming of Christ to pray?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unbecoming that Christ should pray.
    For, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 24), "prayer is the asking for
    becoming things from God." But since Christ could do all things, it does not
    seem becoming to Him to ask anything from anyone. Therefore it does not seem
    fitting that Christ should pray.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we need not ask in prayer for what we
    know for certain will happen; thus, we do not pray that the sun may rise
    tomorrow. Nor is it fitting that anyone should ask in prayer for what he
    knows will not happen. But Christ in all things knew what would happen.
    Therefore it was not fitting that He should ask anything in prayer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 24)
    that "prayer is the raising up of the mind to God." Now Christ's mind needed
    no uplifting to God, since His mind was always united to God, not only by
    the union of the hypostasis, but by the fruition of beatitude. Therefore it
    was not fitting that Christ should pray.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++6%3A12"
      >Lk. 6:12</a
    >): "And it came to pass in those days, that He went out into a mountain,
    and He passed the whole night in the prayer of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As was said in the SS, Question [83], Articles
    [1],2, prayer is the unfolding of our will to God, that He may fulfill it.
    If, therefore, there had been but one will in Christ, viz. the Divine, it
    would nowise belong to Him to pray, since the Divine will of itself is
    effective of whatever He wishes by it, according to Ps. 134:6: "Whatsoever
    the Lord pleased, He hath done." But because the Divine and the human wills
    are distinct in Christ, and the human will of itself is not efficacious
    enough to do what it wishes, except by Divine power, hence to pray belongs
    to Christ as man and as having a human will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ as God and not as man was able to
    carry out all He wished, since as man He was not omnipotent, as stated above
    (<a href="TP013.html#TPQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>,
    <a href="TP013.html#TPQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Nevertheless being both
    God and man, He wished to offer prayers to the Father, not as though He were
    incompetent, but for our instruction. First, that He might show Himself to
    be from the Father; hence He says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++11%3A42"
      >Jn. 11:42</a
    >): "Because of the people who stand about I have said it" (i.e. the words
    of the prayer) "that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me." Hence Hilary
    says (De Trin. x): "He did not need prayer. It was for us He prayed, lest
    the Son should be unknown." Secondly, to give us an example of prayer; hence
    Ambrose says (on Lk. 6:12): "Be not deceived, nor think that the Son of God
    prays as a weakling, in order to beseech what He cannot effect. For the
    Author of power, the Master of obedience persuades us to the precepts of
    virtue by His example." Hence Augustine says (Tract. civ in Joan.): "Our
    Lord in the form of a servant could have prayed in silence, if need be, but
    He wished to show Himself a suppliant of the Father, in such sort as to bear
    in mind that He was our Teacher."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Amongst the other things which He knew
    would happen, He knew that some would be brought about by His prayer; and
    for these He not unbecomingly besought God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To rise is nothing more than to move
    towards what is above. Now movement is taken in two ways, as is said De
    Anima iii, 7; first, strictly, according as it implies the passing from
    potentiality to act, inasmuch as it is the act of something imperfect, and
    thus to rise pertains to what is potentially and not actually above. Now in
    this sense, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 24), "the human mind of
    Christ did not need to rise to God, since it was ever united to God both by
    personal being and by the blessed vision." Secondly, movement signifies the
    act of something perfect, i.e. something existing in act, as to understand
    and to feel are called movements; and in this sense the mind of Christ was
    always raised up to God, since He was always contemplating Him as existing
    above Himself.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether it pertains to Christ to pray according to His sensuality?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it pertains to Christ to pray
    according to His sensuality. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++83%3A3"
      >Ps. 83:3</a
    >) in the person of Christ: "My heart and My flesh have rejoiced in the
    Living God." Now sensuality is called the appetite of the flesh. Hence
    Christ's sensuality could ascend to the Living God by rejoicing; and with
    equal reason by praying.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prayer would seem to pertain to that
    which desires what is besought. Now Christ besought something that His
    sensuality desired when He said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++26%3A39"
      >Mt. 26:39</a
    >): "Let this chalice pass from Me." Therefore Christ's sensuality
    prayed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is a greater thing to be united to
    God in person than to mount to Him in prayer. But the sensuality was assumed
    by God to the unity of Person, even as every other part of human nature.
    Much more, therefore, could it mount to God by prayer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Phil++2%3A7"
      >Phil. 2:7</a
    >) that the Son of God in the nature that He assumed was "made in the
    likeness of men." But the rest of men do not pray with their sensuality.
    Therefore, neither did Christ pray according to His sensuality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> To pray according to sensuality may be
    understood in two ways. First as if prayer itself were an act of the
    sensuality; and in this sense Christ did not pray with His sensuality, since
    His sensuality was of the same nature and species in Christ as in us. Now in
    us the sensuality cannot pray for two reasons; first because the movement of
    the sensuality cannot transcend sensible things, and, consequently, it
    cannot mount to God, which is required for prayer; secondly, because prayer
    implies a certain ordering inasmuch as we desire something to be fulfilled
    by God; and this is the work of reason alone. Hence prayer is an act of the
    reason, as was said in the SS, Question [83], Article [1].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, we may be said to pray according to the sensuality when our prayer
    lays before God what is in our appetite of sensuality; and in this sense
    Christ prayed with His sensuality inasmuch as His prayer expressed the
    desire of His sensuality, as if it were the advocate of the sensuality---and
    this, that He might teach us three things. First, to show that He had taken
    a true human nature, with all its natural affections: secondly, to show that
    a man may wish with his natural desire what God does not wish: thirdly, to
    show that man should subject his own will to the Divine will. Hence
    Augustine says in the Enchiridion (Serm. 1 in Ps. 32): "Christ acting as a
    man, shows the proper will of a man when He says 'Let this chalice pass from
    Me'; for this was the human will desiring something proper to itself and, so
    to say, private. But because He wishes man to be righteous and to be
    directed to God, He adds: 'Nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,' as
    if to say, 'See thyself in Me, for thou canst desire something proper to
    thee, even though God wishes something else.'"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The flesh rejoices in the Living God,
    not by the act of the flesh mounting to God, but by the outpouring of the
    heart into the flesh, inasmuch as the sensitive appetite follows the
    movement of the rational appetite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the sensuality wished what the
    reason besought, it did not belong to the sensuality to seek this by
    praying, but to the reason, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The union in person is according to the
    personal being, which pertains to every part of the human nature; but the
    uplifting of prayer is by an act which pertains only to the reason, as
    stated above. Hence there is no parity.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether it was fitting that Christ should pray for Himself?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not fitting that Christ
    should pray for Himself. For Hilary says (De Trin. x): "Although His word of
    beseeching did not benefit Himself, yet He spoke for the profit of our
    faith." Hence it seems that Christ prayed not for Himself but for us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one prays save for what He wishes,
    because, as was said (<a href="TP021.html#TPQ21A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>),
    prayer is an unfolding of our will to God that He may fulfil it. Now Christ
    wished to suffer what He suffered. For Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxvi):
    "A man, though unwilling, is often angry; though unwilling, is sad; though
    unwilling, sleeps; though unwilling, hungers and thirsts. But He" (i.e.
    Christ) "did all these things, because He wished." Therefore it was not
    fitting that He should pray for Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Cyprian says (De Orat. Dom.): "The
    Doctor of Peace and Master of Unity did not wish prayers to be offered
    individually and privately, lest when we prayed we should pray for ourselves
    alone." Now Christ did what He taught, according to Acts 1:1: "Jesus began
    to do and to teach." Therefore Christ never prayed for Himself alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord Himself said while praying (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++17%3A1"
      >Jn. 17:1</a
    >): "Glorify Thy Son."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Christ prayed for Himself in two ways. First,
    by expressing the desire of His sensuality, as stated above (<a
      href="TP021.html#TPQ21A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >); or also of His simple will, considered as a nature; as when He prayed
    that the chalice of His Passion might pass from Him (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++26%3A39"
      >Mt. 26:39</a
    >). Secondly, by expressing the desire of His deliberate will, which is
    considered as reason; as when He prayed for the glory of His Resurrection
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++17%3A1">Jn. 17:1</a>).
    And this is reasonable. For as we have said above (<a
      href="TP021.html#TPQ21A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 1) Christ wished to pray to His Father in order to give us an example
    of praying; and also to show that His Father is the author both of His
    eternal procession in the Divine Nature, and of all the good that He
    possesses in the human nature. Now just as in His human nature He had
    already received certain gifts from His Father. so there were other gifts
    which He had not yet received, but which He expected to receive. And
    therefore, as He gave thanks to the Father for gifts already received in His
    human nature, by acknowledging Him as the author thereof, as we read (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++26%3A27;+Jn++11:41"
      >Mt. 26:27; Jn. 11:41</a
    >): so also, in recognition of His Father, He besought Him in prayer for
    those gifts still due to Him in His human nature, such as the glory of His
    body, and the like. And in this He gave us an example, that we should give
    thanks for benefits received, and ask in prayer for those we have not as
    yet.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Hilary is speaking of vocal prayer,
    which was not necessary to Him for His own sake, but only for ours. Whence
    he says pointedly that "His word of beseeching did not benefit Himself." For
    if "the Lord hears the desire of the poor," as is said in the Ps. 9:38, much
    more the mere will of Christ has the force of a prayer with the Father:
    wherefore He said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++11%3A42"
      >Jn. 11:42</a
    >): "I know that Thou hearest Me always, but because of the people who stand
    about have I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ wished indeed to suffer what He
    suffered, at that particular time: nevertheless He wished to obtain, after
    His passion, the glory of His body, which as yet He had not. This glory He
    expected to receive from His Father as the author thereof, and therefore it
    was fitting that He should pray to Him for it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This very glory which Christ, while
    praying, besought for Himself, pertained to the salvation of others
    according to Rm. 4:25: "He rose again for our justification." Consequently
    the prayer which He offered for Himself was also in a manner offered for
    others. So also anyone that asks a boon of God that he may use it for the
    good of others, prays not only for himself, but also for others.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether Christ's prayer was always heard?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's prayer was not always
    heard. For He besought that the chalice of His passion might be taken from
    Him, as we read (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++26%3A39"
      >Mt. 26:39</a
    >): and yet it was not taken from Him. Therefore it seems that not every
    prayer of His was heard.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, He prayed that the sin of those who
    crucified Him might be forgiven, as is related (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++23%3A34"
      >Lk. 23:34</a
    >). Yet not all were pardoned this sin, since the Jews were punished on
    account thereof. Therefore it seems that not every prayer of His was
    heard.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, our Lord prayed for them "who would
    believe in Him through the word" of the apostles, that they "might all be
    one in Him," and that they might attain to being with Him (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++17%3A20,21,24"
      >Jn. 17:20,21,24</a
    >). But not all attain to this. Therefore not every prayer of His was
    heard.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++21%3A3"
      >Ps. 21:3</a
    >) in the person of Christ: "I shall cry by day, and Thou wilt not hear."
    Not every prayer of His, therefore, was heard.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++5%3A7"
      >Heb. 5:7</a
    >): "With a strong cry and tears offering up prayers... He was heard for His
    reverence."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="TP021.html#TPQ21A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), prayer is a certain manifestation of the human will. Wherefore, then is
    the request of one who prays granted, when his will is fulfilled. Now
    absolutely speaking the will of man is the will of reason; for we will
    absolutely that which we will in accordance with reason's deliberation.
    Whereas what we will in accordance with the movement of sensuality, or even
    of the simple will, which is considered as nature is willed not absolutely
    but conditionally [secundum quid]---that is, provided no obstacle be
    discovered by reason's deliberation. Wherefore such a will should rather be
    called a "velleity" than an absolute will; because one would will [vellet]
    if there were no obstacle.<br />
  </p>

    But according to the will of reason, Christ willed nothing but what He knew
    God to will. Wherefore every absolute will of Christ, even human, was
    fulfilled, because it was in conformity with God; and consequently His every
    prayer was fulfilled. For in this respect also is it that other men's
    prayers are fulfilled, in that their will is in conformity with God,
    according to Rm. 8:27: "And He that searcheth the hearts knoweth," that is,
    approves of, "what the Spirit desireth," that is, what the Spirit makes the
    saints to desire: "because He asketh for the saints according to God," that
    is, in conformity with the Divine will.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This prayer for the passing of the
    chalice is variously explained by the Saints. For Hilary (Super Matth. 31)
    says: "When He asks that this may pass from Him, He does not pray that it
    may pass by Him, but that others may share in that which passes on from Him
    to them; So that the sense is: As I am partaking of the chalice of the
    passion, so may others drink of it, with unfailing hope, with unflinching
    anguish, without fear of death."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Or according to Jerome (on Mt. 26:39): "He says pointedly, 'This chalice,'
    that is of the Jewish people, who cannot allege ignorance as an excuse for
    putting Me to death, since they have the Law and the Prophets, who foretold
    concerning Me."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Or, according to Dionysius of Alexandria (De Martyr. ad Origen 7): "When He
    says 'Remove this chalice from Me,' He does not mean, 'Let it not come to
    Me'; for if it come not, it cannot be removed. But, as that which passes is
    neither untouched nor yet permanent, so the Saviour beseeches, that a
    slightly pressing trial may be repulsed."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, Ambrose, Origen and Chrysostom say that He prayed thus "as man,"
    being reluctant to die according to His natural will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, therefore, whether we understand, according to Hilary, that He thus
    prayed that other martyrs might be imitators of His Passion, or that He
    prayed that the fear of drinking His chalice might not trouble Him, or that
    death might not withhold Him, His prayer was entirely fulfilled. But if we
    understand that He prayed that He might not drink the chalice of His passion
    and death; or that He might not drink it at the hands of the Jews; what He
    besought was not indeed fulfilled, because His reason which formed the
    petition did not desire its fulfilment, but for our instruction, it was His
    will to make known to us His natural will, and the movement of His
    sensuality, which was His as man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Our Lord did not pray for all those who
    crucified Him, as neither did He for all those who would believe in Him; but
    for those only who were predestinated to obtain eternal life through Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Wherefore the reply to the third objection is also manifest.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> When He says: "I shall cry and Thou wilt
    not hear," we must take this as referring to the desire of sensuality, which
    shunned death. But He is heard as to the desire of His reason, as stated
    above.<br />
