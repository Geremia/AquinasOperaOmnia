<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the manifestation of the newly born Christ: 
concerning which there are eight points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP036.html#TPQ36A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Christ's birth should have been made known to all?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP036.html#TPQ36A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it should have been made known to some?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP036.html#TPQ36A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether He should have made Himself known, or should He rather have 
been manifested by others?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP036.html#TPQ36A5THEP1">(5)</a> By what other means should it have been made known?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP036.html#TPQ36A6THEP1">(6)</a> Of the order of these manifestations;

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's birth should have been made known to 
all. Because fulfilment should correspond to promise. Now, the promise of 
Christ's coming is thus expressed (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++49:3">Ps. 49:3</a>): "God shall come manifestly. 
But He came by His birth in the flesh." Therefore it seems that His birth 
should have been made known to the whole world.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++1:15">1 Tim. 1:15</a>): "Christ came into this 
world to save sinners." But this is not effected save in as far as the 
grace of Christ is made known to them; according to Titus 2:11,12: "The 
grace of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men, instructing us, that 
denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and 
justly, and godly in this world." Therefore it seems that Christ's birth 
should have been made known to all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God is most especially inclined to mercy; according to 
Ps. 144:9: "His tender mercies are over all His works." But in His second 
coming, when He will "judge justices" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++70:3">Ps. 70:3</a>), He will come before the 
eyes of all; according to Mt. 24:27: "As lightning cometh out of the 
east, and appeareth even into the west, so shall also the coming of the 
Son of Man be." Much more, therefore, should His first coming, when He 
was born into the world according to the flesh, have been made known to 
all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++45:15">Is. 45:15</a>): "Thou art a hidden God, the 
Holy [Vulg.: 'the God] of Israel, the Saviour." And, again (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++43:3">Is. 43:3</a>): 
"His look was, as it were, hidden and despised."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It was unfitting that Christ's birth should be made known 
to all men without distinction. First, because this would have been a 
hindrance to the redemption of man, which was accomplished by means of 
the Cross; for, as it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++2:8">1 Cor. 2:8</a>): "If they had known it, 
they would never have crucified the Lord of glory."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, because this would have lessened the merit of faith, which He 
came to offer men as the way to righteousness. according to Rm. 3:22: 
"The justice of God by faith of Jesus Christ." For if, when Christ was 
born, His birth had been made known to all by evident signs, the very 
nature of faith would have been destroyed, since it is "the evidence of 
things that appear not," as stated, Heb. 11:1.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, because thus the reality of His human nature would have come 
into doubt. Whence Augustine says (Ep. ad Volusianum cxxxvii): "If He had 
not passed through the different stages of age from babyhood to youth, 
had neither eaten nor slept, would He not have strengthened an erroneous 
opinion, and made it impossible for us to believe that He had become true 
man? And while He is doing all things wondrously, would He have taken 
away that which He accomplished in mercy?" 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to the gloss, the words quoted must be understood 
of Christ's coming as judge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All men were to be instructed unto salvation, concerning 
the grace of God our Saviour, not at the very time of His birth, but 
afterwards, in due time, after He had "wrought salvation in the midst of 
the earth" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++73:12">Ps. 73:12</a>). Wherefore after His Passion and Resurrection, He 
said to His disciples (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++28:19">Mt. 28:19</a>): "Going . . . teach ye all nations."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> For judgment to be passed, the authority of the judge needs 
to be known: and for this reason it behooves that the coming of Christ 
unto judgment should be manifest. But His first coming was unto the 
salvation of all, which is by faith that is of things not seen. And 
therefore it was fitting that His first coming should be hidden.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's birth should not have been made known 
to anyone. For, as stated above (<A Href="TP036.html#TPQ36A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3), it befitted the salvation 
of mankind that Christ's first coming should be hidden. But Christ came 
to save all; according to 1 Tim. 4:10: "Who is the Saviour of all men, 
especially of the faithful." Therefore Christ's birth should not have 
been made known to anyone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, before Christ was born, His future birth was made known 
to the Blessed Virgin and Joseph. Therefore it was not necessary that it 
should be made known to others after His birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no wise man makes known that from which arise 
disturbance and harm to others. But, when Christ's birth was made known, 
disturbance arose: for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++2:3">Mt. 2:3</a>) that "King Herod, hearing" 
of Christ's birth, "was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him." Moreover, 
this brought harm to others; because it was the occasion of Herod's 
killing "all the male children that were in Bethlehem . . . from two 
years old and under." Therefore it seems unfitting for Christ's birth to 
have been made known to anyone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Christ's birth would have been profitable to none if it 
had been hidden from all. But it behooved Christ's birth to be 
profitable: else He were born in vain. Therefore it seems that Christ's 
birth should have been made known to some.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++13:1">Rm. 13:1</a>) "what is of God is well 
ordered." Now it belongs to the order of Divine wisdom that God's gifts 
and the secrets of His wisdom are not bestowed on all equally, but to 
some immediately, through whom they are made known to others. Wherefore, 
with regard to the mystery of the Resurrection it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+10:40,41">Acts 10:40,41</a>): "God . . . gave" Christ rising again "to be made manifest, not 
to all the people, but to witnesses pre-ordained by God." Consequently, 
that His birth might  be consistent with this, it should have been made 
known, not to all, but to some, through whom it could be made known to 
others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As it would have been prejudicial to the salvation of 
mankind if God's birth had been made known to all men, so also would it 
have been if none had been informed of it. Because in either case faith 
is destroyed, whether a thing be perfectly manifest, or whether it be 
entirely unknown, so that no one can hear it from another; for "faith 
cometh by hearing" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++10:17">Rm. 10:17</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Mary and Joseph needed to be instructed concerning Christ's 
birth before He was born, because it devolved on them to show reverence 
to the child conceived in the womb, and to serve Him even before He was 
born. But their testimony, being of a domestic character, would have 
aroused suspicion in regard to Christ's greatness: and so it behooved it 
to be made known to others, whose testimony could not be suspect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The very disturbance that arose when it was known that 
Christ was born was becoming to His birth. First, because thus the 
heavenly dignity of Christ is made manifest. Wherefore Gregory says (Hom. 
x in Evang.): "After the birth of the King of heaven, the earthly king is 
troubled: doubtless because earthly grandeur is covered with confusion 
when the heavenly majesty is revealed."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, thereby the judicial power of Christ was foreshadowed. Thus 
Augustine says in a sermon (30 de Temp.) on the Epiphany: "What will He 
be like in the judgment-seat; since from His cradle He struck terror into 
the heart of a proud king?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, because thus the overthrow of the devil's kingdom was 
foreshadowed. For, as Pope Leo says in a sermon on the Epiphany (Serm. v 
[*Opus Imperfectum in Matth., Hom. ii, falsely ascribed to St. John 
Chrysostom]): "Herod was not so much troubled in himself as the devil in 
Herod. For Herod thought Him to be a man, but the devil thought Him to be 
God. Each feared a successor to his kingdom: the devil, a heavenly 
successor; Herod, an earthly successor." But their fear was needless: 
since Christ had not come to set up an earthly kingdom, as Pope Leo says, 
addressing himself to Herod: "Thy palace cannot hold Christ: nor is the 
Lord of the world content with the paltry power of thy scepter." That the 
Jews were troubled, who, on the contrary, should have rejoiced, was 
either because, as Chrysostom says, "wicked men could not rejoice at the 
coming of the Holy one," or because they wished to court favor with 
Herod, whom they feared; for "the populace is inclined to favor too much 
those whose cruelty it endures."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And that the children were slain by Herod was not harmful to them, but 
profitable. For Augustine says in a sermon on the Epiphany (66 de 
Diversis): "It cannot be questioned that Christ, who came to set man 
free, rewarded those who were slain for Him; since, while hanging on the 
cross, He prayed for those who were putting Him to death."<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that those to whom Christ's birth was made known 
were not suitably chosen. For our Lord (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++10:5">Mt. 10:5</a>) commanded His 
disciples, "Go ye not into the way of the Gentiles," so that He might be 
made known to the Jews before the Gentiles. Therefore it seems that much 
less should Christ's birth have been at once revealed to the Gentiles who 
"came from the east," as stated Mt. 2:1.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the revelation of Divine truth should be made especially 
to the friends of God, according to Job 37 [Vulg.: Job 36:33]: "He 
sheweth His friend concerning it." But the Magi seem to be God's foes; 
for it is written (Lev. 19:31): "Go not aside after wizards [magi], 
neither ask anything of soothsayers." Therefore Christ's birth should not 
have been made known to the Magi.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ came in order to set free the whole world from 
the power of the devil; whence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Malachi+1:11">Malachi 1:11</a>): "From the 
rising of the sun even to the going down, My name is great among the 
Gentiles." Therefore He should have been made known, not only to those 
who dwelt in the east, but also to some from all parts of the world.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, all the sacraments of the Old Law were figures of 
Christ. But the sacraments of the Old Law were dispensed through the 
ministry of the legal priesthood. Therefore it seems that Christ's birth 
should have been made known rather to the priests in the Temple than to 
the shepherds in the fields.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Christ was born of a Virgin-Mother, and was as yet a 
little child. It was therefore more suitable that He should be made known 
to youths and virgins than to old and married people or to widows, such 
as Simeon and Anna.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++13:18">Jn. 13:18</a>): "I know whom I have chosen." 
But what is done by God's wisdom is done becomingly. Therefore those to 
whom Christ's birth was made known were suitably chosen.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Salvation, which was to be accomplished by Christ, 
concerns all sorts and conditions of men: because, as it is written (Col. 
3:11), in Christ "there is neither male nor female, [*These words are in 
reality from Gal. 3:28] neither Gentile nor Jew . . . bond nor free," and 
so forth. And in order that this might be foreshadowed in Christ's birth, 
He was made known to men of all conditions. Because, as Augustine says in 
a sermon on the Epiphany (32 de Temp.), "the shepherds were Israelites, 
the Magi were Gentiles. The former were nigh to Him, the latter far from 
Him. Both hastened to Him together as to the cornerstone." There was also 
another point of contrast: for the Magi were wise and powerful; the 
shepherds simple and lowly. He was also made known to  the righteous as 
Simeon and Anna; and to sinners, as the Magi. He was made known both to 
men, and to women---namely, to Anna---so as to show no condition of men 
to be excluded from Christ's redemption.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That manifestation of Christ's birth was a kind of 
foretaste of the full manifestation which was to come. And as in the 
later manifestation the first announcement of the grace of Christ was 
made by Him and His Apostles to the Jews and afterwards to the Gentiles, 
so the first to come to Christ were the shepherds, who were the 
first-fruits of the Jews, as being near to Him; and afterwards came the 
Magi from afar, who were "the first-fruits of the Gentiles," as Augustine 
says (Serm. 30 de Temp. cc.).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says in a sermon on the Epiphany (Serm. 30 de 
Temp.): "As unskilfulness predominates in the rustic manners of the 
shepherd, so ungodliness abounds in the profane rites of the Magi. Yet 
did this Corner-Stone draw both to Itself; inasmuch as He came 'to choose 
the foolish things that He might confound the wise,' and 'not to call the 
just, but sinners,'" so that "the proud might not boast, nor the weak 
despair." Nevertheless, there are those who say that these Magi were not 
wizards, but wise astronomers, who are called Magi among the Persians or 
Chaldees.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Chrysostom says [*Hom. ii in Matth. in the Opus Imperf., 
among the supposititious works of Chrysostom]: "The Magi came from the 
east, because the first beginning of faith came from the land where the 
day is born; since faith is the light of the soul." Or, "because all who 
come to Christ come from Him and through Him": whence it is written 
(Zach. 6:12): "Behold a Man, the Orient is His name." Now, they are said 
to come from the east literally, either because, as some say, they came 
from the farthest parts of the east, or because they came from the 
neighboring parts of Judea that lie to the east of the region inhabited 
by the Jews. Yet it is to be believed that certain signs of Christ's 
birth appeared also in other parts of the world: thus, at Rome the river 
flowed with oil [*Eusebius, Chronic. II, Olymp. 185]; and in Spain three 
suns were seen, which gradually merged into one [*Cf. Eusebius, Chronic. 
II, Olymp. 184].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Chrysostom observes (Theophylact., Enarr. in Luc. ii, 
8), the angel who announced Christ's birth did not go to Jerusalem, nor 
did he seek the Scribes and Pharisees, for they were corrupted, and full 
of ill-will. But the shepherds were single-minded, and were like the 
patriarchs and Moses in their mode of life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, these shepherds were types of the Doctors of the Church, to 
whom are revealed the mysteries of Christ that were hidden from the Jews.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> As Ambrose says (on Lk. 2:25): "It was right that our 
Lord's birth should be attested not only by the shepherds, but  also by 
people advanced in age and virtue": whose testimony is rendered the more 
credible by reason of their righteousness.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ Himself should have made His birth know?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ should have Himself made His birth 
known. For "a direct cause is always of greater power than an indirect 
cause," as is stated Phys. viii. But Christ made His birth known through 
others---for instance, to the shepherds through the angels, and to the 
Magi through the star. Much more, therefore, should He Himself have made 
His birth known.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (Ecclus. 20:32): "Wisdom that is hid and 
treasure that is not seen; what profit is there in them both?" But Christ 
had, to perfection, the treasure of wisdom and grace from the beginning 
of His conception. Therefore, unless He had made the fulness of these 
gifts known by words and deeds, wisdom and grace would have been given 
Him to no purpose. But this is unreasonable: because "God and nature do 
nothing without a purpose" (De Coelo i).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we read in the book De Infantia Salvatoris that in His 
infancy Christ worked many miracles. It seems therefore that He did 
Himself make His birth known.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Leo says (Serm. xxxiv) that the Magi found the 
"infant Jesus in no way different from the generality of human infants." 
But other infants do not make themselves known. Therefore it was not 
fitting that Christ should Himself make His birth known.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Christ's birth was ordered unto man's salvation, which is 
by faith. But saving faith confesses Christ's Godhead and humanity. It 
behooved, therefore, Christ's birth to be made known in such a way that 
the proof of His Godhead should not be prejudicial to faith in His human 
nature. But this took place while Christ presented a likeness of human 
weakness, and yet, by means of God's creatures, He showed the power of 
the Godhead in Himself. Therefore Christ made His birth known, not by 
Himself, but by means of certain other creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By the way of generation and movement we must of necessity 
come to the imperfect before the perfect. And therefore Christ was made 
known first through other creatures, and afterwards He Himself manifested 
Himself perfectly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although hidden wisdom is useless, yet there is no need for 
a wise man to make himself known at all times, but at a suitable time; 
for it is written (Ecclus. 20:6): "There is one that holdeth his peace 
because he knoweth not what to say: and there is another that holdeth his 
peace, knowing the proper time." Hence the wisdom given to Christ was not 
useless, because at a suitable time He manifested Himself. And the very 
fact that He was  hidden at a suitable time is a sign of wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The book De Infantia Salvatoris is apocryphal. Moreover, 
Chrysostom (Hom. xxi super Joan.) says that Christ worked no miracles 
before changing the water into wine, according to Jn. 2:11: "'This 
beginning of miracles did Jesus.' For if He had worked miracles at an 
early age, there would have been no need for anyone else to manifest Him 
to the Israelites; whereas John the Baptist says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++1:31">Jn. 1:31</a>): 'That He may 
be made manifest in Israel; therefore am I come baptizing with water.' 
Moreover, it was fitting that He should not begin to work miracles at an 
early age. For people would have thought the Incarnation to be unreal, 
and, out of sheer spite, would have crucified Him before the proper time."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ's birth should have been manifested by means of the angels and the star?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's birth should not have been manifested 
by means of the angels. For angels are spiritual substances, according to 
Ps. 103:4: "Who maketh His [Vulg.: 'makest Thy'] angels, spirits." But 
Christ's birth was in the flesh, and not in His spiritual substance. 
Therefore it should not have been manifested by means of angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the righteous are more akin to the angels than to any 
other, according to Ps. 33:8: "The angel of the Lord shall encamp round 
about them that fear Him, and shall deliver them." But Christ's birth was 
not announced to the righteous, viz. Simeon and Anna, through the angels. 
Therefore neither should it have been announced to the shepherds by means 
of the angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it seems that neither ought it to have been announced to 
the Magi by means of the star. For this seems to favor the error of those 
who think that man's birth is influenced by the stars. But occasions of 
sin should be taken away from man. Therefore it was not fitting that 
Christ's birth should be announced by a star.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a sign should be certain, in order that something be 
made known thereby. But a star does not seem to be a certain sign of 
Christ's birth. Therefore Christ's birth was not suitably announced by a 
star.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++32:4">Dt. 32:4</a>): "The works of God are 
perfect." But this manifestation is the work of God. Therefore it was 
accomplished by means of suitable signs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As knowledge is imparted through a syllogism from 
something which we know better, so knowledge given by signs must be 
conveyed through things which are familiar to those to whom the knowledge 
is imparted. Now, it is clear that the righteous have, through the spirit 
of prophecy, a certain familiarity with the interior instinct of the Holy 
Ghost, and are wont to be taught  thereby, without the guidance of 
sensible signs. Whereas others, occupied with material things, are led 
through the domain of the senses to that of the intellect. The Jews, 
however, were accustomed to receive Divine answers through the angels; 
through whom they also received the Law, according to Acts 7:53: "You 
[Vulg.: 'who'] . . . have received the Law by the disposition of angels." 
And the Gentiles, especially astrologers, were wont to observe the course 
of the stars. And therefore Christ's birth was made known to the 
righteous, viz. Simeon and Anna, by the interior instinct of the Holy 
Ghost, according to Lk. 2:26: "He had received an answer from the Holy 
Ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Christ of the 
Lord." But to the shepherds and Magi, as being occupied with material 
things, Christ's birth was made known by means of visible apparitions. 
And since this birth was not only earthly, but also, in a way, heavenly, 
to both (shepherds and Magi) it is revealed through heavenly signs: for, 
as Augustine says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cciv): "The angels 
inhabit, and the stars adorn, the heavens: by both, therefore, do the 
'heavens show forth the glory of God.'" Moreover, it was not without 
reason that Christ's birth was made known, by means of angels, to the 
shepherds, who, being Jews, were accustomed to frequent apparitions of 
the angels: whereas it was revealed by means of a star to the Magi, who 
were wont to consider the heavenly bodies. Because, as Chrysostom says 
(Hom. vi in Matth.): "Our Lord deigned to call them through things to 
which they were accustomed." There is also another reason. For, as 
Gregory says (Hom. x in Evang.): "To the Jews, as rational beings, it was 
fitting that a rational animal [*Cf. FP, Question [51], Article [1], ad 2]," viz. an 
angel, "should preach. Whereas the Gentiles, who were unable to come to 
the knowledge of God through the reason, were led to God, not by words, 
but by signs. And as our Lord, when He was able to speak, was announced 
by heralds who spoke, so before He could speak He was manifested by 
speechless elements." Again, there is yet another reason. For, as 
Augustine [*Pope Leo] says in a sermon on the Epiphany: "To Abraham was 
promised an innumerable progeny, begotten, not of carnal propagation, but 
of the fruitfulness of faith. For this reason it is compared to the 
multitude of stars; that a heavenly progeny might be hoped for." 
Wherefore the Gentiles, "who are thus designated by the stars, are by the 
rising of a new star stimulated" to seek Christ, through whom they are 
made the seed of Abraham.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That which of itself is hidden needs to be manifested, but 
not that which in itself is manifest. Now, the flesh of Him who was born 
was manifest, whereas the Godhead was hidden. And therefore it was 
fitting that this birth should be made known by angels, who are the 
ministers of God. Wherefore also a certain "brightness" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++2:9">Lk. 2:9</a>) 
accompanied the angelic apparition, to indicate that He who was just born 
was the "Brightness of" the Father's "glory."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The righteous did not need the visible apparition of the 
angel; on account of their perfection the interior instinct of the Holy 
Ghost was enough for them. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The star which manifested Christ's birth removed all 
occasion of error. For, as Augustine says (Contra Faust. ii): "No 
astrologer has ever so far connected the stars with man's fate at the 
time of his birth as to assert that one of the stars, at the birth of any 
man, left its orbit and made its way to him who was just born": as 
happened in the case of the star which made known the birth of Christ. 
Consequently this does not corroborate the error of those who "think 
there is a connection between man's birth and the course of the stars, 
for they do not hold that the course of the stars can be changed at a 
man's birth."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same sense Chrysostom says (Hom. vi in Matth.): "It is not an 
astronomer's business to know from the stars those who are born, but to 
tell the future from the hour of a man's birth: whereas the Magi did not 
know the time of the birth, so as to conclude therefrom some knowledge of 
the future; rather was it the other way about."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Chrysostom relates (Hom. ii in Matth.) that, according to 
some apocryphal books, a certain tribe in the far east near the ocean was 
in the possession of a document written by Seth, referring to this star 
and to the presents to be offered: which tribe watched attentively for 
the rising of this star, twelve men being appointed to take observations, 
who at stated times repaired to the summit of a mountain with faithful 
assiduity: whence they subsequently perceived the star containing the 
figure of a small child, and above it the form of a cross.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or we may say, as may be read in the book De Qq. Vet. et Nov. Test., qu. 
lxiii, that "these Magi followed the tradition of Balaam," who said, "'A 
star shall rise out of Jacob.' Wherefore observing this star to be a 
stranger to the system of this world, they gathered that it was the one 
foretold by Balaam to indicate the King of the Jews."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or again, it may be said with Augustine, in a sermon on the Epiphany 
(ccclxxiv), that "the Magi had received a revelation through the angels" 
that the star was a sign of the birth of Christ: and he thinks it 
probable that these were "good angels; since in adoring Christ they were 
seeking for salvation."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or with Pope Leo, in a sermon on the Epiphany (xxxiv), that "besides the 
outward form which aroused the attention of their corporeal eyes, a more 
brilliant ray enlightened their minds with the light of faith."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ's birth was made known in a becoming order?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's birth was made known in an unbecoming 
order. For Christ's birth should have been made known to them first who 
were nearest to Christ, and who longed for Him most; according to Wis. 
6:14: "She preventeth them that covet her, so  that she first showeth 
herself unto them." But the righteous were nearest to Christ by faith, 
and longed most for His coming; whence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++2:25">Lk. 2:25</a>) of Simeon 
that "he was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel." 
Therefore Christ's birth should have been made known to Simeon before the 
shepherds and Magi.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Magi were the "first-fruits of the Gentiles," who 
were to believe in Christ. But first the "fulness of the Gentiles . . . 
come in" unto faith, and afterwards "all Israel" shall "be saved," as is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++11:25">Rm. 11:25</a>). Therefore Christ's birth should have been made known 
to the Magi before the shepherds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++2:16">Mt. 2:16</a>) that "Herod killed all the male 
children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two 
years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently 
inquired from the wise men": so that it seems that the Magi were two 
years in coming to Christ after His birth. It was therefore unbecoming 
that Christ should be made known to the Gentiles so long after His birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dan++2:21">Dan. 2:21</a>): "He changes time and ages." 
Consequently the time of the manifestation of Christ's birth seems to 
have been arranged in a suitable order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Christ's birth was first made known to the shepherds on 
the very day that He was born. For, as it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++2:8,15,16">Lk. 2:8,15,16</a>): 
"There were in the same country shepherds watching, and keeping the 
night-watches over their flock . . . And it came to pass, after the 
angels departed from them into heaven they [Vulg.: 'the shepherds'] said 
one to another: Let us go over to Bethlehem . . . and they came with 
haste." Second in order were the Magi, who came to Christ on the 
thirteenth day after His birth, on which day is kept the feast of the 
Epiphany. For if they had come after a year, or even two years, they 
would not have found Him in Bethlehem, since it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++2:39">Lk. 2:39</a>) 
that "after they had performed all things according to the law of the 
Lord"---that is to say, after they had offered up the Child Jesus in the 
Temple---"they returned into Galilee, to their city"---namely, 
"Nazareth." In the third place, it was made known in the Temple to the 
righteous on the fortieth day after His birth, as related by Luke (2:22).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason of this order is that the shepherds represent the apostles 
and other believers of the Jews, to whom the faith of Christ was made 
known first; among whom there were "not many mighty, not many noble," as 
we read 1 Cor. 1:26. Secondly, the faith of Christ came to the "fulness 
of the Gentiles"; and this is foreshadowed in the Magi. Thirdly it came 
to the fulness of the Jews, which is foreshadowed in the righteous. 
Wherefore also Christ was manifested to them in the Jewish Temple.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++9:30,31">Rm. 9:30,31</a>): "Israel, by following 
after the law of justice, is not come unto the law of  justice": but the 
Gentiles, "who followed not after justice," forestalled the generality of 
the Jews in the justice which is of faith. As a figure of this, Simeon, 
"who was waiting for the consolation of Israel," was the last to know 
Christ born: and he was preceded by the Magi and the shepherds, who did 
not await the coming of Christ with such longing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the "fulness of the Gentiles came in" unto faith 
before the fulness of the Jews, yet the first-fruits of the Jews preceded 
the first-fruits of the Gentiles in faith. For this reason the birth of 
Christ was made known to the shepherds before the Magi.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There are two opinions about the apparition of the star 
seen by the Magi. For Chrysostom (Hom. ii in Matth. [*Opus Imperf. in 
Matth., falsely ascribed to Chrysostom]), and Augustine in a sermon on 
the Epiphany (cxxxi, cxxxii), say that the star was seen by the Magi 
during the two years that preceded the birth of Christ: and then, having 
first considered the matter and prepared themselves for the journey, they 
came from the farthest east to Christ, arriving on the thirteenth day 
after His birth. Wherefore Herod, immediately after the departure of the 
Magi, "perceiving that He was deluded by them," commanded the male 
children to be killed "from two years old and under," being doubtful lest 
Christ were already born when the star appeared, according as he had 
heard from the Magi.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But others say that the star first appeared when Christ was born, and 
that the Magi set off as soon as they saw the star, and accomplished a 
journey of very great length in thirteen days, owing partly to the Divine 
assistance, and partly to the fleetness of the dromedaries. And I say 
this on the supposition that they came from the far east. But others, 
again, say that they came from a neighboring country, whence also was 
Balaam, to whose teaching they were heirs; and they are said to have come 
from the east, because their country was to the east of the country of 
the Jews. In this case Herod killed the babes, not as soon as the Magi 
departed, but two years after: and that either because he is said to have 
gone to Rome in the meanwhile on account of an accusation brought against 
him, or because he was troubled at some imminent peril, and for the time 
being desisted from his anxiety to slay the child, or because he may have 
thought that the Magi, "being deceived by the illusory appearance of the 
star, and not finding the child, as they had expected to, were ashamed to 
return to him": as Augustine says (De Consensu Evang. ii). And the reason 
why he killed not only those who were two years old, but also the younger 
children, would be, as Augustine says in a sermon on the Innocents, 
because he feared lest a child whom the stars obey, might make himself 
appear older or younger.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the star which appeared to the Magi belonged 
to the heavenly system. For Augustine says in a sermon on the Epiphany 
(cxxii): "While God yet clings to the breast, and suffers Himself to be 
wrapped in humble swaddling clothes, suddenly a new star shines forth in 
the heavens." Therefore the star which appeared to the Magi belonged to 
the heavenly system.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cci): 
"Christ was made known to the shepherds by angels, to the Magi by a star. 
A heavenly tongue speaks to both, because the tongue of the prophets 
spoke no longer." But the angels who appeared to the shepherds were 
really angels from heaven. Therefore also the star which appeared to the 
Magi was really a star from the heavens.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, stars which are not in the heavens but in the air are 
called comets, which do not appear at the birth of kings, but rather are 
signs of their approaching death. But this star was a sign of the King's 
birth: wherefore the Magi said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++2:2">Mt. 2:2</a>): "Where is He that is born King 
of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the east." Therefore it seems 
that it was a star from the heavens.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Contra Faust. ii): "It was not one of 
those stars which since the beginning of the creation observe the course 
appointed to them by the Creator; but this star was a stranger to the 
heavens, and made its appearance at the strange sight of a virgin in 
childbirth."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[7] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Chrysostom says (Hom. vi in Matth.), it is clear, for 
many reasons, that the star which appeared to the Magi did not belong to 
the heavenly system. First, because no other star approaches from the 
same quarter as this star, whose course was from north to south, these 
being the relative positions of Persia, whence the Magi came, and Judea. 
Secondly, from the time [at which it was seen]. For it appeared not only 
at night, but also at midday: and no star can do this, not even the moon. 
Thirdly, because it was visible at one time and hidden at another. For 
when they entered Jerusalem it hid itself: then, when they had left 
Herod, it showed itself again. Fourthly, because its movement was not 
continuous, but when the Magi had to continue their journey the star 
moved on; when they had to stop the star stood still; as happened to the 
pillar of a cloud in the desert. Fifthly, because it indicated the 
virginal Birth, not by remaining aloft, but by coming down below. For it 
is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++2:9">Mt. 2:9</a>) that "the star which they had seen in the east went 
before them, until it came and stood over where the child was." Whence it 
is evident that the words of the Magi, "We have seen His star in the 
east," are to be taken as meaning, not that when they were in the east 
the star appeared over the country of Judea, but that when they saw the 
star it was in the east, and that it preceded them into Judea (although 
this is considered doubtful by some). But it could not have indicated the 
house distinctly, unless it were near the earth. And, as he [Chrysostom] 
observes, this does not seem fitting to a star, but  "of some power 
endowed with reason." Consequently "it seems that this was some invisible 
force made visible under the form of a star."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[7] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore some say that, as the Holy Ghost, after our Lord's Baptism, 
came down on Him under the form of a dove, so did He appear to the Magi 
under the form of a star. While others say that the angel who, under a 
human form, appeared to the shepherds, under the form of a star, appeared 
to the Magi. But it seems more probable that it was a newly created star, 
not in the heavens, but in the air near the earth, and that its movement 
varied according to God's will. Wherefore Pope Leo says in a sermon on 
the Epiphany (xxxi): "A star of unusual brightness appeared to the three 
Magi in the east, which, through being more brilliant and more beautiful 
than the other stars, drew men's gaze and attention: so that they 
understood at once that such an unwonted event could not be devoid of 
purpose."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In Holy Scripture the air is sometimes called the 
heavens---for instance, "The birds of the heavens [Douay: 'air'] and the 
fishes of the sea."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The angels of heaven, by reason of their very office, come 
down to us, being "sent to minister." But the stars of heaven do not 
change their position. Wherefore there is no comparison.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the star did not follow the course of the heavenly 
stars, so neither did it follow the course of the comets, which neither 
appear during the daytime nor vary their customary course. Nevertheless 
in its signification it has something in common with the comets. Because 
the heavenly kingdom of Christ "shall break in pieces, and shall consume 
all the kingdoms" of the earth, "and itself shall stand for ever" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dan++2:44">Dan. 2:44</a>).

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it was becoming that the Magi should come to adore Christ and pay homage to Him?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was unbecoming that the Magi should come to 
adore Christ and pay homage to Him. For reverence is due to a king from 
his subjects. But the Magi did not belong to the kingdom of the Jews. 
Therefore, since they knew by seeing the star that He that was born was 
the "King of the Jews," it seems unbecoming that they should come to 
adore Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it seems absurd during the reign of one king to proclaim 
a stranger. But in Judea Herod was reigning. Therefore it was foolish of 
the Magi to proclaim the birth of a king.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a heavenly sign is more certain than a human sign. But 
the Magi had come to Judea from the east, under the guidance of a 
heavenly sign. Therefore it was foolish of them to seek human guidance 
besides that of the star, saying: "Where is He  that is born King of the 
Jews?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[8] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the offering of gifts and the homage of adoration are 
not due save to kings already reigning. But the Magi did not find Christ 
resplendent with kingly grandeur. Therefore it was unbecoming for them to 
offer Him gifts and homage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++60:3">Is. 60:3</a>): "[The Gentiles] shall walk in 
the light, and kings in the brightness of thy rising." But those who walk 
in the Divine light do not err. Therefore the Magi were right in offering 
homage to Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP036.html#TPQ36A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1), the Magi are the 
"first-fruits of the Gentiles" that believed in Christ; because their 
faith was a presage of the faith and devotion of the nations who were to 
come to Christ from afar. And therefore, as the devotion and faith of the 
nations is without any error through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, 
so also we must believe that the Magi, inspired by the Holy Ghost, did 
wisely in paying homage to Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cc.): 
"Though many kings of the Jews had been born and died, none of them did 
the Magi seek to adore. And so they who came from a distant foreign land 
to a kingdom that was entirely strange to them, had no idea of showing 
such great homage to such a king as the Jews were wont to have. But they 
had learnt that such a King was born that by adoring Him they might be 
sure of obtaining from Him the salvation which is of God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By proclaiming [Christ King] the Magi foreshadowed the 
constancy of the Gentiles in confessing Christ even until death. Whence 
Chrysostom says (Hom. ii in Matth.) that, while they thought of the King 
who was to come, the Magi feared not the king who was actually present. 
They had not yet seen Christ, and they were already prepared to die for 
Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cc.): "The 
star which led the Magi to the place where the Divine Infant was with His 
Virgin-Mother could bring them to the town of Bethlehem, in which Christ 
was born. Yet it hid itself until the Jews also bore testimony of the 
city in which Christ was to be born: so that, being encouraged by a 
twofold witness," as Pope Leo says (Serm. xxxiv), "they might seek with 
more ardent faith Him, whom both the brightness of the star and the 
authority of prophecy revealed." Thus they "proclaim" that Christ is 
born, and "inquire where; they believe and ask, as it were, betokening 
those who walk by faith and desire to see," as Augustine says in a sermon 
on the Epiphany (cxcix). But the Jews, by indicating to them the place of 
Christ's birth, "are like the carpenters who built the Ark of Noe, who 
provided others with the means of escape, and themselves perished in the 
flood. Those who asked, heard and went their way: the teachers spoke and 
stayed where they were; like the milestones that point out the way but 
walk not" (Augustine, Serm. cclxxiii).  It was also by God's will that, 
when they no longer saw the star, the Magi, by human instinct, went to 
Jerusalem, to seek in the royal city the new-born King, in order that 
Christ's birth might be publicly proclaimed first in Jerusalem, according 
to Is. 2:3: "The Law shall come forth from Sion, and the Word of the Lord 
from Jerusalem"; and also "in order that by the zeal of the Magi who came 
from afar, the indolence of the Jews who lived near at hand, might be 
proved worthy of condemnation" (Remig., Hom. in Matth. ii, 1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[36] A[8] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Chrysostom says (Hom. ii in Matth. [*From the 
supposititious Opus Imperfectum]): "If the Magi had come in search of an 
earthly King, they would have been disconcerted at finding that they had 
taken the trouble to come such a long way for nothing. Consequently they 
would have neither adored nor offered gifts. But since they sought a 
heavenly King, though they found in Him no signs of royal pre-eminence, 
yet, content with the testimony of the star alone, they adored: for they 
saw a man, and they acknowledged a God." Moreover, they offer gifts in 
keeping with Christ's greatness: "gold, as to the great King; they offer 
up incense as to God, because it is used in the Divine Sacrifice; and 
myrrh, which is used in embalming the bodies of the dead, is offered as 
to Him who is to die for the salvation of all" (Gregory, Hom. x in 
Evang.). And hereby, as Gregory says (Hom. x in Evang.), we are taught to 
offer gold, "which signifies wisdom, to the new-born King, by the luster 
of our wisdom in His sight." We offer God incense, "which signifies 
fervor in prayer, if our constant prayers mount up to God with an odor of 
sweetness"; and we offer myrrh, "which signifies mortification of the 
flesh, if we mortify the ill-deeds of the flesh by refraining from them."<br>
