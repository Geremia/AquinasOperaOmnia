<H3 Align="Center">OF THE MATTER FROM WHICH THE SAVIOUR'S BODY WAS CONCEIVED (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider the Saviour's conception. First, as to the 
matter from which His body was conceived; secondly, as to the author of 
His conception; thirdly, as to the manner and order of His conception. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the first there are eight points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the flesh of Christ was derived from Adam?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it was derived from David?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A3THEP1">(3)</a> Of the genealogy of Christ which is given in the Gospels;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it was fitting for Christ to be born of a woman?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether His body was formed from the purest blood of the Virgin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether the flesh of Christ was in the patriarchs as to something 
signate?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether the flesh of Christ in the patriarchs was subject to sin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether Christ paid tithes in the loins of Abraham?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's flesh was not derived from Adam. For 
the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A47">1 Cor. 15:47</a>): "The first man was of the earth, 
earthly: the second man, from heaven, heavenly." Now, the first man is 
Adam: and the second man is Christ. Therefore Christ is not derived from 
Adam, but has an origin distinct from him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the conception of Christ should have been most 
miraculous. But it is a greater miracle to form man's body from the slime 
of the earth, than from human matter derived from Adam. It seems 
therefore unfitting that Christ should take flesh from Adam. Therefore 
the body of Christ should not have been formed from the mass of the human 
race derived from Adam, but of some other matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by "one man sin entered into this world," i.e. by Adam, 
because in him all nations sinned originally, as is clear from Rm. 5:12. 
But if Christ's body was derived from Adam, He would have been in Adam 
originally when he sinned: therefore he would have contracted original 
sin; which is unbecoming in His purity. Therefore the body of Christ was 
not formed of matter derived from Adam.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++2%3A16">Heb. 2:16</a>): "Nowhere doth He"---that 
is, the Son of God---"take hold of the angels: but of the seed of Abraham 
He taketh hold." But the seed of Abraham was derived from Adam. Therefore 
Christ's body was formed of matter derived from Adam.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Christ assumed human nature in order to cleanse it of 
corruption. But human nature did not need to be cleansed save in as far 
as it was soiled in its tainted origin whereby it was descended from 
Adam. Therefore it was becoming that He should assume flesh of matter 
derived from Adam, that the nature itself might be healed by the 
assumption.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The second man, i.e. Christ, is said to be of heaven, not 
indeed as to the matter from which His body was formed,  but either as to 
the virtue whereby it was formed; or even as to His very Godhead. But as 
to matter, Christ's body was earthly, as Adam's body was.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP029.html#TPQ29OUTP1">Question [29]</a>, <A Href="TP029.html#TPQ29A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2) the mystery of Christ's 
Incarnation is miraculous, not as ordained to strengthen faith, but as an 
article of faith. And therefore in the mystery of the Incarnation we do 
not seek that which is most miraculous, as in those miracles that are 
wrought for the confirmation of faith' but what is most becoming to 
Divine wisdom, and most expedient to the salvation of man, since this is 
what we seek in all matters of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It may also be said that in the mystery of the Incarnation the miracle 
is not only in reference to the matter of the conception, but rather in 
respect of the manner of the conception and birth; inasmuch as a virgin 
conceived and gave birth to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP015.html#TPQ15OUTP1">Question [15]</a>, <A Href="TP015.html#TPQ15A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), Christ's body was in 
Adam in respect of a bodily substance---that is to say, that the 
corporeal matter of Christ's body was derived from Adam: but it was not 
there by reason of seminal virtue, because it was not conceived from the 
seed of man. Thus it did not contract original sin, as others who are 
descended from Adam by man's seed.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ took flesh of the seed of David?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ did not take flesh of the seed of 
David. For Matthew, in tracing the genealogy of Christ, brings it down to 
Joseph. But Joseph was not Christ's father, as shown above (<A Href="TP028.html#TPQ28OUTP1">Question [28]</a>, <A Href="TP028.html#TPQ28A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1,2). Therefore it seems that Christ was not descended from David.
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Aaron was of the tribe of Levi, as related Ex. 6. Now 
Mary the Mother of Christ is called the cousin of Elizabeth, who was a 
daughter of Aaron, as is clear from Lk. 1:5,36. Therefore, since David 
was of the tribe of Juda, as is shown Mt. 1, it seems that Christ was not 
descended from David.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written of Jechonias (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++22%3A30">Jer. 22:30</a>): "Write this man 
barren . . . for there shall not be a man of his seed that shall sit upon 
the throne of David." Whereas of Christ it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++9%3A7">Is. 9:7</a>): "He 
shall sit upon the throne of David." Therefore Christ was not of the seed 
of Jechonias: nor, consequently, of the family of David, since Matthew 
traces the genealogy from David through Jechonias.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A3">Rm. 1:3</a>): "Who was made to him of the 
seed of David according to the flesh."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Christ is said to have been the son especially of two of 
the patriarchs, Abraham and David, as is clear from Mt. 1:1. There are 
many reasons for this. First to these especially was  the promise made 
concerning Christ. For it was said to Abraham (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++22%3A18">Gn. 22:18</a>): "In thy seed 
shall all the nations of the earth be blessed": which words the Apostle 
expounds of Christ (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++3%3A16">Gal. 3:16</a>): "To Abraham were the promises made and to 
his seed. He saith not, 'And to his seeds' as of many; but as of one, 
'And to thy seed,' which is Christ." And to David it was said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++131%3A11">Ps. 131:11</a>): "Of the fruit of thy womb I will set upon thy throne." Wherefore 
the Jewish people, receiving Him with kingly honor, said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++21%3A9">Mt. 21:9</a>): 
"Hosanna to the Son of David."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A second reason is because Christ was to be king, prophet, and priest. 
Now Abraham was a priest; which is clear from the Lord saying unto him 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++15%3A9">Gn. 15:9</a>): "Take thee [Vulg.: 'Me'] a cow of three years old," etc. He 
was also a prophet, according to Gn. 20:7: "He is a prophet; and he shall 
pray for thee." Lastly David was both king and prophet.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A third reason is because circumcision had its beginning in Abraham: 
while in David God's election was most clearly made manifest, according 
to 1 Kgs. 13:14: "The Lord hath sought Him a man according to His own 
heart." And consequently Christ is called in a most special way the Son 
of both, in order to show that He came for the salvation both of the 
circumcised and of the elect among the Gentiles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Faustus the Manichean argued thus, in the desire to prove 
that Christ is not the Son of David, because He was not conceived of 
Joseph, in whom Matthew's genealogy terminates. Augustine answered this 
argument thus (Contra Faust. xxii): "Since the same evangelist affirms 
that Joseph was Mary's husband and that Christ's mother was a virgin, and 
that Christ was of the seed of Abraham, what must we believe, but that 
Mary was not a stranger to the family of David: and that it is not 
without reason that she was called the wife of Joseph, by reason of the 
close alliance of their hearts, although not mingled in the flesh; and 
that the genealogy is traced down to Joseph rather than to her by reason 
of the dignity of the husband? So therefore we believe that Mary was also 
of the family of David: because we believe the Scriptures, which assert 
both that Christ was of the seed of David according to the flesh, and 
that Mary was His Mother, not by sexual intercourse but retaining her 
virginity." For as Jerome says on Mt. 1:18: "Joseph and Mary were of the 
same tribe: wherefore he was bound by law to marry her as she was his 
kinswoman. Hence it was that they were enrolled together at Bethlehem, as 
being descended from the same stock."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Gregory of Nazianzum answers this objection by saying that 
it happened by God's will, that the royal family was united to the 
priestly race, so that Christ, who is both king and priest, should be 
born of both according to the flesh. Wherefore Aaron, who was the first 
priest according to the Law, married a wife of the tribe of Juda, 
Elizabeth, daughter of Aminadab. It is therefore possible that 
Elizabeth's father married a wife of the family of David, through whom 
the Blessed Virgin Mary, who was of  the family of David, would be a 
cousin of Elizabeth. or conversely, and with greater likelihood, that the 
Blessed Mary's father, who was of the family of David, married a wife of 
the family of Aaron.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, it may be said with Augustine (Contra Faust. xxii) that if 
Joachim, Mary's father, was of the family of Aaron (as the heretic 
Faustus pretended to prove from certain apocryphal writings), then we 
must believe that Joachim's mother, or else his wife, was of the family 
of David, so long as we say that Mary was in some way descended from 
David.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Ambrose says on Lk. 3:25, this prophetical passage does 
not deny that a posterity will be born of the seed of Jechonias. And so 
Christ is of his seed. Neither is the fact that Christ reigned contrary 
to prophecy, for He did not reign with worldly honor; since He declared: 
"My kingdom is not of this world."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ's genealogy is suitably traced by the evangelists?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's genealogy is not suitably traced by 
the Evangelists. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++53%3A8">Is. 53:8</a>): "Who shall declare His 
generation?" Therefore Christ's genealogy should not have been set down.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one man cannot possibly have two fathers. But Matthew 
says that "Jacob begot Joseph, the husband of Mary": whereas Luke says 
that Joseph was the son of Heli. Therefore they contradict one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there seem to be divergencies between them on several 
points. For Matthew, at the commencement of his book, beginning from 
Abraham and coming down to Joseph, enumerates forty-two generations. 
Whereas Luke sets down Christ's genealogy after His Baptism, and 
beginning from Christ traces the series of generations back to God, 
counting in all seventy-seven generations, the first and last included. 
It seems therefore that their accounts of Christ's genealogy do not agree.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, we read (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Kgs++8%3A24">4 Kgs. 8:24</a>) that Joram begot Ochozias, who was 
succeeded by his son Joas: who was succeeded by his son Amasius: after 
whom reigned his son Azarias, called Ozias; who was succeeded by his son 
Joathan. But Matthew says that Joram begot Ozias. Therefore it seems that 
his account of Christ's genealogy is unsuitable, since he omits three 
kings in the middle thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, all those who are mentioned in Christ's genealogy had 
both a father and a mother, and many of them had brothers also. Now in 
Christ's genealogy Matthew mentions only three mothers---namely, Thamar, 
Ruth, and the wife of Urias. He also mentions the brothers of Judas and 
Jechonias, and also Phares and Zara. But Luke mentions none of these. 
Therefore the  evangelists seem to have described the genealogy of Christ 
in an unsuitable manner.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The authority of Scripture suffices.
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Tim++3%3A16">2 Tim. 3:16</a>), "All Holy Scripture is 
inspired of God [Vulg.: 'All scripture inspired of God is profitable'], 
etc. Now what is done by God is done in perfect order, according to Rm. 
13:1: "Those that are of God are ordained [Vulg.: 'Those that are, are 
ordained of God']. Therefore Christ's genealogy is set down by the 
evangelists in a suitable order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Jerome says on Mt. 1, Isaias speaks of the generation of 
Christ's Godhead. Whereas Matthew relates the generation of Christ in His 
humanity; not indeed by explaining the manner of the Incarnation, which 
is also unspeakable; but by enumerating Christ's forefathers from whom He 
was descended according to the flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Various answers have been made by certain writers to this 
objection which was raised by Julian the Apostate; for some, as Gregory 
of Nazianzum, say that the people mentioned by the two evangelists are 
the same, but under different names, as though they each had two. But 
this will not stand: because Matthew mentions one of David's 
sons---namely, Solomon; whereas Luke mentions another---namely, Nathan, 
who according to the history of the kings (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Sam++5%3A14">2 Kgs. 5:14</a>) were clearly 
brothers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 2/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore others said that Matthew gave the true genealogy of Christ: 
while Luke gave the supposititious genealogy; hence he began: "Being (as 
it was supposed) the son of Joseph." For among the Jews there were some 
who believed that, on account of the crimes of the kings of Juda, Christ 
would be born of the family of David, not through the kings, but through 
some other line of private individuals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 3/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Others again have supposed that Matthew gave the forefathers according 
to the flesh: whereas Luke gave these according to the spirit, that is, 
righteous men, who are called (Christ's) forefathers by likeness of 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 4/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But an answer is given in the Qq. Vet. et Nov. Test. [*Part i, qu. lvi; 
part 2, qu. vi] to the effect that we are not to understand that Joseph 
is said by Luke to be the son of Heli: but that at the time of Christ, 
Heli and Joseph were differently descended from David. Hence Christ is 
said to have been supposed to be the son of Joseph, and also to have been 
the son of Heli as though (the Evangelist) were to say that Christ, from 
the fact that He was the son of Joseph, could be called the son of Heli 
and of all those who were descended from David; as the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++9%3A5">Rm. 9:5</a>): "Of whom" (viz. the Jews) "is Christ according to the flesh."
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 5/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine again gives three solutions (De Qq. Evang. ii), saying: "There 
are three motives by one or other of which the  evangelist was guided. 
For either one evangelist mentions Joseph's father of whom he was 
begotten; whilst the other gives either his maternal grandfather or some 
other of his later forefathers; or one was Joseph's natural father: the 
other is father by adoption. Or, according to the Jewish custom, one of 
those having died without children, a near relation of his married his 
wife, the son born of the latter union being reckoned as the son of the 
former": which is a kind of legal adoption, as Augustine himself says (De 
Consensu Evang. ii, Cf. Retract. ii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 6/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This last motive is the truest: Jerome also gives it commenting on Mt. 
1:16; and Eusebius of Caesarea in his Church history (I, vii), says that 
it is given by Africanus the historian. For these writers says that 
Mathan and Melchi, at different times, each begot a son of one and the 
same wife, named Estha. For Mathan, who traced his descent through 
Solomon, had married her first, and died, leaving one son, whose name was 
Jacob: and after his death, as the law did not forbid his widow to 
remarry, Melchi, who traced his descent through Mathan, being of the same 
tribe though not of the same family as Mathan, married his widow, who 
bore him a son, called Heli; so that Jacob and Heli were uterine brothers 
born to different fathers. Now one of these, Jacob, on his brother Heli 
dying without issue, married the latter's widow, according to the 
prescription of the law, of whom he had a son, Joseph, who by nature was 
his own son, but by law was accounted the son of Heli. Wherefore Matthew 
says "Jacob begot Joseph": whereas Luke, who was giving the legal 
genealogy, speaks of no one as begetting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 7/7-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And although Damascene (De Fide Orth. iv) says that the Blessed Virgin 
Mary was connected with Joseph in as far as Heli was accounted as his 
father, for he says that she was descended from Melchi: yet must we also 
believe that she was in some way descended from Solomon through those 
patriarchs enumerated by Matthew, who is said to have set down Christ's 
genealogy according to the flesh; and all the more since Ambrose states 
that Christ was of the seed of Jechonias.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> According to Augustine (De Consensu Evang. ii) "Matthew 
purposed to delineate the royal personality of Christ; Luke the priestly 
personality: so that in Matthew's genealogy is signified the assumption 
of our sins by our Lord Jesus Christ": inasmuch as by his carnal origin 
"He assumed 'the likeness of sinful flesh.' But in Luke's genealogy the 
washing away of our sins is signified," which is effected by Christ's 
sacrifice. "For which reason Matthew traces the generations downwards, 
Luke upwards." For the same reason too "Matthew descends from David 
through Solomon, in whose mother David sinned; whereas Luke ascends to 
David through Nathan, through whose namesake, the prophet, God expiated 
his sin." And hence it is also that, because "Matthew wished to signify 
that Christ had condescended to our mortal nature, he set down the 
genealogy of Christ at the very outset of his Gospel, beginning with 
Abraham and descending to Joseph and the birth of Christ Himself. Luke, 
on the contrary, sets forth Christ's genealogy not at the outset, but 
after Christ's Baptism, and not in the  descending but in the ascending 
order: as though giving prominence to the office of the priest in 
expiating our sins, to which John bore witness, saying: 'Behold Him who 
taketh away the sin of the world.' And in the ascending order, he passes 
Abraham and continues up to God, to whom we are reconciled by cleansing 
and expiating. With reason too he follows the origin of adoption; because 
by adoption we become children of God: whereas by carnal generation the 
Son of God became the Son of Man. Moreover he shows sufficiently that he 
does not say that Joseph was the son of Heli as though begotten by him, 
but because he was adopted by him, since he says that Adam was the son of 
God, inasmuch as he was created by God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the number forty pertains to the time of our present life: 
because of the four parts of the world in which we pass this mortal life 
under the rule of Christ. And forty is the product of four multiplied by 
ten: while ten is the sum of the numbers from one to four. The number ten 
may also refer to the decalogue; and the number four to the present life; 
or again to the four Gospels, according to which Christ reigns in us. And 
thus "Matthew, putting forward the royal personality of Christ, 
enumerates forty persons not counting Him" (cf. Augustine, De Consensu 
Evang. ii). But this is to be taken on the supposition that it be the 
same Jechonias at the end of the second, and at the commencement of the 
third series of fourteen, as Augustine understands it. According to him 
this was done in order to signify "that under Jechonias there was a 
certain defection to strange nations during the Babylonian captivity; 
which also foreshadowed the fact that Christ would pass from the Jews to 
the Gentiles."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, Jerome (on Mt. 1:12-15) says that there were two 
Joachims---that is, Jechonias, father and son: both of whom are mentioned 
in Christ's genealogy, so as to make clear the distinction of the 
generations, which the evangelist divides into three series of fourteen; 
which amounts in all to forty-two persons. Which number may also be 
applied to the Holy Church: for it is the product of six, which signifies 
the labor of the present life, and seven, which signifies the rest of the 
life to come: for six times seven are forty-two. The number fourteen, 
which is the sum of ten and four, can also be given the same 
signification as that given to the number forty, which is the product of 
the same numbers by multiplication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the number used by Luke in Christ's genealogy signifies the 
generality of sins. "For the number ten is shown in the ten precepts of 
the Law to be the number of righteousness. Now, to sin is to go beyond 
the restriction of the Law. And eleven is the number beyond ten." And 
seven signifies universality: because "universal time is involved in 
seven days." Now seven times eleven are seventy-seven: so that this 
number signifies the generality of sins which are taken away by Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Jerome says on Mt. 1:8,11: "Because Joram allied himself 
with the family of the most wicked Jezabel,  therefore his memory is 
omitted down to the third generation, lest it should be inserted among 
the holy predecessors of the Nativity." Hence as Chrysostom [*Cf. Opus 
Imperf. in Matth. Hom. i, falsely ascribed to Chrysostom] says: "Just as 
great was the blessing conferred on Jehu, who wrought vengeance on the 
house of Achab and Jezabel, so also great was the curse on the house of 
Joram, through the wicked daughter of Achab and Jezabel, so that until 
the fourth generation his posterity is cut off from the number of kings, 
according to Ex. 20:5: I shall visit [Vulg.: 'Visiting'] the iniquity of 
the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generations."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It must also be observed that there were other kings who sinned and are 
mentioned in Christ's genealogy: but their impiety was not continuous. 
For, as it is stated in the book De Qq. Vet. et Nov. Test. qu. lxxxv: 
"Solomon through his father's merits is included in the series of kings; 
and Roboam . . . through the merits of Asa," who was son of his 
(Roboam's) son, Abiam. "But the impiety of those three [*i.e. Ochozias, 
Joas, and Amasias, of whom St. Augustine asks in this question lxxxv, why 
they were omitted by St. Matthew] was continuous."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> As Jerome says on Mt. 1:3: "None of the holy women are 
mentioned in the Saviour's genealogy, but only those whom Scripture 
censures, so that He who came for the sake of sinners, by being born of 
sinners, might blot out all sin." Thus Thamar is mentioned, who is 
censured for her sin with her father-in-law; Rahab who was a whore; Ruth 
who was a foreigner; and Bethsabee, the wife of Urias, who was an 
adulteress. The last, however, is not mentioned by name, but is 
designated through her husband; both on account of his sin, for he was 
cognizant of the adultery and murder; and further in order that, by 
mentioning the husband by name, David's sin might be recalled. And 
because Luke purposes to delineate Christ as the expiator of our sins, he 
makes no mention of these women. But he does mention Juda's brethren, in 
order to show that they belong to God's people: whereas Ismael, the 
brother of Isaac, and Esau, Jacob's brother, were cut off from God's 
people, and for this reason are not mentioned in Christ's genealogy. 
Another motive was to show the emptiness of pride of birth: for many of 
Juda's brethren were born of hand-maidens, and yet all were patriarchs 
and heads of tribes. Phares and Zara are mentioned together, because, as 
Ambrose says on Lk. 3:23, "they are the type of the twofold life of man: 
one, according to the Law," signified by Zara; "the other by Faith," of 
which Phares is the type. The brethren of Jechonias are included, because 
they all reigned at various times: which was not the case with other 
kings: or, again, because they were alike in wickedness and misfortune.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the matter of Christ's body should have been taken from a woman?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the matter of Christ's body should not have 
been taken from a woman. For the male sex is more noble  than the female. 
But it was most suitable that Christ should assume that which is perfect 
in human nature. Therefore it seems that He should not have taken flesh 
from a woman but rather from man: just as Eve was formed from the rib of 
a man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever is conceived of a woman is shut up in her womb. 
But it ill becomes God, Who fills heaven and earth, as is written Jer. 
23:24, to be shut up within the narrow limits of the womb. Therefore it 
seems that He should not have been conceived of a woman.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, those who are conceived of a woman contract a certain 
uncleanness: as it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+25%3A4">Job 25:4</a>): "Can man be justified compared 
with God? Or he that is born of a woman appear clean?" But it was 
unbecoming that any uncleanness should be in Christ: for He is the Wisdom 
of God, of whom it is written (Wis. 7:25) that "no defiled thing cometh 
into her." Therefore it does not seem right that He should have taken 
flesh from a woman.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++4%3A4">Gal. 4:4</a>): "God sent His Son, made of a 
woman."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Although the Son of God could have taken flesh from 
whatever matter He willed, it was nevertheless most becoming that He 
should take flesh from a woman. First because in this way the entire 
human nature was ennobled. Hence Augustine says (Questions. lxxxiii, qu. 11): 
"It was suitable that man's liberation should be made manifest in both 
sexes. Consequently, since it behooved a man, being of the nobler sex, to 
assume, it was becoming that the liberation of the female sex should be 
manifested in that man being born of a woman."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, because thus the truth of the Incarnation is made evident. 
Wherefore Ambrose says (De Incarn. vi): "Thou shalt find in Christ many 
things both natural, and supernatural. In accordance with nature He was 
within the womb," viz. of a woman's body: "but it was above nature that a 
virgin should conceive and give birth: that thou mightest believe that He 
was God, who was renewing nature; and that He was man who, according to 
nature, was being born of a man." And Augustine says (Ep. ad Volus. 
cxxxvii): "If Almighty God had created a man formed otherwise than in a 
mother's womb, and had suddenly produced him to sight . . . would He not 
have strengthened an erroneous opinion, and made it impossible for us to 
believe that He had become a true man? And whilst He is doing all things 
wondrously, would He have taken away that which He accomplished in mercy? 
But now, He, the mediator between God and man, has so shown Himself, 
that, uniting both natures in the unity of one Person, He has given a 
dignity to ordinary by extraordinary things, and tempered the 
extraordinary by the ordinary."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, because in this fashion the begetting of man is accomplished in 
every variety of manner. For the first man was made from the "slime of 
the earth," without the concurrence of man or woman: Eve was made of man 
but not of woman: and other men are made  from both man and woman. So 
that this fourth manner remained as it were proper to Christ, that He 
should be made of a woman without the concurrence of a man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The male sex is more noble than the female, and for this 
reason He took human nature in the male sex. But lest the female sex 
should be despised, it was fitting that He should take flesh of a woman. 
Hence Augustine says (De Agone Christ. xi): "Men, despise not yourselves: 
the Son of God became a man: despise not yourselves, women; the Son of 
God was born of a woman."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine thus (Contra Faust. xxiii) replies to Faustus, 
who urged this objection; "By no means," says he, "does the Catholic 
Faith, which believes that Christ the Son of God was born of a virgin, 
according to the flesh, suppose that the same Son of God was so shut up 
in His Mother's womb, as to cease to be elsewhere, as though He no longer 
continued to govern heaven and earth, and as though He had withdrawn 
Himself from the Father. But you, Manicheans, being of a mind that admits 
of nought but material images, are utterly unable to grasp these things." 
For, as he again says (Ep. ad Volus. cxxxvii), "it belongs to the sense 
of man to form conceptions only through tangible bodies, none of which 
can be entire everywhere, because they must of necessity be diffused 
through their innumerable parts in various places . . . Far otherwise is 
the nature of the soul from that of the body: how much more the nature of 
God, the Creator of soul and body! . . . He is able to be entire 
everywhere, and to be contained in no place. He is able to come without 
moving from the place where He was; and to go without leaving the spot 
whence He came."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There is no uncleanness in the conception of man from a 
woman, as far as this is the work of God: wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+10%3A15">Acts 10:15</a>): "That which God hath cleansed do not thou call common," i.e. 
unclean. There is, however, a certain uncleanness therein, resulting from 
sin, as far as lustful desire accompanies conception by sexual union. But 
this was not the case with Christ, as shown above (<A Href="TP028.html#TPQ28OUTP1">Question [28]</a>, <A Href="TP028.html#TPQ28A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But if 
there were any uncleanness therein, the Word of God would not have been 
sullied thereby, for He is utterly unchangeable. Wherefore Augustine says 
(Contra Quinque Haereses v): "God saith, the Creator of man: What is it 
that troubles thee in My Birth? I was not conceived by lustful desire. I 
made Myself a mother of whom to be born. If the sun's rays can dry up the 
filth in the drain, and yet not be defiled: much more can the Splendor of 
eternal light cleanse whatever It shines upon, but Itself cannot be 
sullied."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the flesh of Christ was conceived of the Virgin's purest blood?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the flesh of Christ was not conceived of the 
Virgin's purest blood: For it is said in the collect (Feast of the 
Annunciation) that God "willed that His Word should take flesh from a 
Virgin." But flesh differs from blood.  Therefore Christ's body was not 
taken from the Virgin's blood.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as the woman was miraculously formed from the man, so 
Christ's body was formed miraculously from the Virgin. But the woman is 
not said to have been formed from the man's blood, but rather from his 
flesh and bones, according to Gn. 2:23: "This now is bone of my bones, 
and flesh of my flesh." It seems therefore that neither should Christ's 
body have been formed from the Virgin's blood, but from her flesh and 
bones.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ's body was of the same species as other men's 
bodies. But other men's bodies are not formed from the purest blood but 
from the semen and the menstrual blood. Therefore it seems that neither 
was Christ's body conceived of the purest blood of the Virgin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii) that "the Son of 
God, from the Virgin's purest blood, formed Himself flesh, animated with 
a rational soul."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), in Christ's conception His being 
born of a woman was in accordance with the laws of nature, but that He 
was born of a virgin was above the laws of nature. Now, such is the law 
of nature that in the generation of an animal the female supplies the 
matter, while the male is the active principle of generation; as the 
Philosopher proves (De Gener. Animal. i). But a woman who conceives of a 
man is not a virgin. And consequently it belongs to the supernatural mode 
of Christ's generation, that the active principle of generation was the 
supernatural power of God: but it belongs to the natural mode of His 
generation, that the matter from which His body was conceived is similar 
to the matter which other women supply for the conception of their 
offspring. Now, this matter, according to the Philosopher (De Gener. 
Animal.), is the woman's blood, not any of her blood, but brought to a 
more perfect stage of secretion by the mother's generative power, so as 
to be apt for conception. And therefore of such matter was Christ's body 
conceived.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since the Blessed Virgin was of the same nature as other 
women, it follows that she had flesh and bones of the same nature as 
theirs. Now, flesh and bones in other women are actual parts of the body, 
the integrity of which results therefrom: and consequently they cannot be 
taken from the body without its being corrupted or diminished. But as 
Christ came to heal what was corrupt, it was not fitting that He should 
bring corruption or diminution to the integrity of His Mother. Therefore 
it was becoming that Christ's body should be formed not from the flesh or 
bones of the Virgin, but from her blood, which as yet is not actually a 
part, but is potentially the whole, as stated in De Gener. Animal. i. 
Hence He is said to have taken flesh from the Virgin, not that the matter 
from which His body was formed was actual flesh, but blood, which is 
flesh potentially.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated in the FP, Question [92], Article [3], ad 2, Adam, through  
being established as a kind of principle of human nature, had in his body 
a certain proportion of flesh and bone, which belonged to him, not as an 
integral part of his personality, but in regard to his state as a 
principle of human nature. And from this was the woman formed, without 
detriment to the man. But in the Virgin's body there was nothing of this 
sort, from which Christ's body could be formed without detriment to His 
Mother's body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Woman's semen is not apt for generation, but is something 
imperfect in the seminal order, which, on account of the imperfection of 
the female power, it has not been possible to bring to complete seminal 
perfection. Consequently this semen is not the necessary matter of 
conception; as the Philosopher says (De Gener. Animal. i): wherefore 
there was none such in Christ's conception: all the more since, though it 
is imperfect in the seminal order, a certain concupiscence accompanies 
its emission, as also that of the male semen: whereas in that virginal 
conception there could be no concupiscence. Wherefore Damascene says (De 
Fide Orth. iii) that Christ's body was not conceived "seminally." But the 
menstrual blood, the flow of which is subject to monthly periods, has a 
certain natural impurity of corruption: like other superfluities, which 
nature does not heed, and therefore expels. Of such menstrual blood 
infected with corruption and repudiated by nature, the conception is not 
formed; but from a certain secretion of the pure blood which by a process 
of elimination is prepared for conception, being, as it were, more pure 
and more perfect than the rest of the blood. Nevertheless, it is tainted 
with the impurity of lust in the conception of other men: inasmuch as by 
sexual intercourse this blood is drawn to a place apt for conception. 
This, however, did not take place in Christ's conception: because this 
blood was brought together in the Virgin's womb and fashioned into a 
child by the operation of the Holy Ghost. Therefore is Christ's body said 
to be "formed of the most chaste and purest blood of the Virgin."<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's body was in Adam and the patriarchs 
as to something signate. For Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. x) that the 
flesh of Christ was in Adam and Abraham "by way of a bodily substance." 
But bodily substance is something signate. Therefore Christ's flesh was 
in Adam, Abraham, and the other patriarchs, according to something 
signate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A3">Rm. 1:3</a>) that Christ "was made . . . of the 
seed of David according to the flesh." But the seed of David was 
something signate in him. Therefore Christ was in David, according to 
something signate, and for the same reason in the other patriarchs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the human race is Christ's kindred, inasmuch as He took 
flesh therefrom. But if that flesh were not something signate in Adam, 
the human race, which is descended from Adam,  would seem to have no 
kindred with Christ: but rather with those other things from which the 
matter of His flesh was taken. Therefore it seems that Christ's flesh was 
in Adam and the other patriarchs according to something signate.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. x) that in whatever way 
Christ was in Adam and Abraham, other men were there also; but not 
conversely. But other men were not in Adam and Abraham by way of some 
signate matter, but only according to origin, as stated in the FP, Question [119]
, Article [1], Article [2], ad 4. Therefore neither was Christ in Adam and Abraham 
according to something signate; and, for the same reason, neither was He 
in the other patriarchs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 1), the matter of Christ's body 
was not the flesh and bones of the Blessed Virgin, nor anything that was 
actually a part of her body, but her blood which was her flesh 
potentially. Now, whatever was in the Blessed Virgin, as received from 
her parents, was actually a part of her body. Consequently that which the 
Blessed Virgin received from her parents was not the matter of Christ's 
body. Therefore we must say that Christ's body was not in Adam and the 
other patriarchs according to something signate, in the sense that some 
part of Adam's or of anyone else's body could be singled out and 
designated as the very matter from which Christ's body was to be formed: 
but it was there according to origin, just as was the flesh of other men. 
For Christ's body is related to Adam and the other patriarchs through the 
medium of His Mother's body. Consequently Christ's body was in the 
patriarchs, in no other way than was His Mother's body, which was not in 
the patriarchs according to signate matter: as neither were the bodies of 
other men, as stated in the FP, Question [119], Article [1], Article [2], ad 4.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The expression "Christ was in Adam according to bodily 
substance," does not mean that Christ's body was a bodily substance in 
Adam: but that the bodily substance of Christ's body, i.e. the matter 
which He took from the Virgin, was in Adam as in its active principle, 
but not as in its material principle: in other words, by the generative 
power of Adam and his descendants down to the Blessed Virgin, this matter 
was prepared for Christ's conception. But this matter was not fashioned 
into Christ's body by the seminal power derived from Adam. Therefore 
Christ is said to have been in Adam by way of origin, according to bodily 
substance: but not according to seminal virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although Christ's body was not in Adam and the other 
patriarchs, according to seminal virtue, yet the Blessed Virgin's body 
was thus in them, through her being conceived from the seed of a man. For 
this reason, through the medium of the Blessed Virgin, Christ is said to 
be of the seed of David, according to the flesh, by way of origin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ and the human race are kindred, through the likeness 
of species. Now, specific likeness results not from remote but from 
proximate matter, and from the active principle  which begets its like in 
species. Thus, then, the kinship of Christ and the human race is 
sufficiently preserved by His body being formed from the Virgin's blood, 
derived in its origin from Adam and the other patriarchs. Nor is this 
kinship affected by the matter whence this blood is taken, as neither is 
it in the generation of other men, as stated in the FP, Question [119], Article [2], ad 
3.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's flesh was not infected by sin in the 
patriarchs. For it is written (Wis. 7:25) that "no defiled thing cometh 
into" Divine Wisdom. But Christ is the Wisdom of God according to 1 Cor. 
1:24. Therefore Christ's flesh was never defiled by sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii) that Christ "assumed 
the first-fruits of our nature." But in the primitive state human flesh 
was not infected by sin. Therefore Christ's flesh was not infected either 
in Adam or in the other patriarchs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. x) that "human nature ever 
had, together with the wound, the balm with which to heal it." But that 
which is infected cannot heal a wound; rather does it need to be healed 
itself. Therefore in human nature there was ever something preserved from 
infection, from which afterwards Christ's body was formed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Christ's body is not related to Adam and the other 
patriarchs, save through the medium of the Blessed Virgin's body, of whom 
He took flesh. But the body of the Blessed Virgin was wholly conceived in 
original sin, as stated above (<A Href="TP014.html#TPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="TP014.html#TPQ14A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1), and thus, as far as it 
was in the patriarchs, it was subject to sin. Therefore the flesh of 
Christ, as far as it was in the patriarchs, was subject to sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[7] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> When we say that Christ or His flesh was in Adam and the 
other patriarchs, we compare Him, or His flesh, to Adam and the other 
patriarchs. Now, it is manifest that the condition of the patriarchs 
differed from that of Christ: for the patriarchs were subject to sin, 
whereas Christ was absolutely free from sin. Consequently a twofold error 
may occur on this point. First, by attributing to Christ, or to His 
flesh, that condition which was in the patriarchs; by saying, for 
instance, that Christ sinned in Adam, since after some fashion He was in 
him. But this is false; because Christ was not in Adam in such a way that 
Adam's sin belonged to Christ: forasmuch as He is not descended from him 
according to the law of concupiscence, or according to seminal virtue; as 
stated above (<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3, <A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A1A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="TP015.html#TPQ15OUTP1">Question [15]</a>, <A Href="TP015.html#TPQ15A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[7] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, error may occur by attributing the condition of Christ or of 
His flesh to that which was actually in the patriarchs: by saying, for 
instance, that, because Christ's flesh, as existing in Christ, was not 
subject to sin, therefore in Adam  also and in the patriarchs there was 
some part of his body that was not subject to sin, and from which 
afterwards Christ's body was formed; as some indeed held. For this is 
quite impossible. First, because Christ's flesh was not in Adam and in 
the other patriarchs, according to something signate, distinguishable 
from the rest of his flesh, as pure from impure; as already stated (<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Secondly, because since human flesh is infected by sin, through being 
conceived in lust, just as the entire flesh of a man is conceived through 
lust, so also is it entirely defiled by sin. Consequently we must say 
that the entire flesh of the patriarchs was subjected to sin, nor was 
there anything in them that was free from sin, and from which afterwards 
Christ's body could be formed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ did not assume the flesh of the human race subject 
to sin, but cleansed from all infection of sin. Thus it is that "no 
defiled thing cometh into the Wisdom of God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ is said to have assumed the first-fruits of our 
nature, as to the likeness of condition; forasmuch as He assumed flesh 
not infected by sin, like unto the flesh of man before sin. But this is 
not to be understood to imply a continuation of that primitive purity, as 
though the flesh of innocent man was preserved in its freedom from sin 
until the formation of Christ's body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Before Christ, there was actually in human nature a wound, 
i.e. the infection of original sin. But the balm to heal the wound was 
not there actually, but only by a certain virtue of origin, forasmuch as 
from those patriarchs the flesh of Christ was to be propagated.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ paid tithes in Abraham's loins?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ "paid tithes" in Abraham's loins. For 
the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++7%3A6-9">Heb. 7:6-9</a>) that Levi, the great-grandson of Abraham, 
"paid tithes in Abraham," because, when the latter paid tithes to 
Melchisedech, "he was yet in his loins." In like manner Christ was in 
Abraham's loins when the latter paid tithes. Therefore Christ Himself 
also paid tithes in Abraham.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ is of the seed of Abraham according to the flesh 
which He received from His Mother. But His Mother paid tithes in Abraham. 
Therefore for a like reason did Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "in Abraham tithe was levied on that which needed 
healing," as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. x). But all flesh subject to 
sin needed healing. Since therefore Christ's flesh was the subject of 
sin, as stated above (<A Href="TP031.html#TPQ31A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), it seems that Christ's flesh paid tithes in 
Abraham.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[8] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, this does not seem to be at all derogatory to Christ's 
dignity. For the fact that the father of a bishop pays tithes to a priest 
does not hinder his son, the bishop, from being  of higher rank than an 
ordinary priest. Consequently, although we may say that Christ paid 
tithes when Abraham paid them to Melchisedech, it does not follow that 
Christ was not greater than Melchisedech.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. x) that "Christ did not 
pay tithes there," i.e. in Abraham, "for His flesh derived from him, not 
the heat of the wound, but the matter of the antidote."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[8] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It behooves us to say that the sense of the passage 
quoted from the Apostle is that Christ did not pay tithes in Abraham. For 
the Apostle proves that the priesthood according to the order of 
Melchisedech is greater than the Levitical priesthood, from the fact that 
Abraham paid tithes to Melchisedech, while Levi, from whom the legal 
priesthood was derived, was yet in his loins. Now, if Christ had also 
paid tithes in Abraham, His priesthood would not have been according to 
the order of Melchisedech, but of a lower order. Consequently we must say 
that Christ did not pay tithes in Abraham's loins, as Levi did.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[8] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For since he who pays a tithe keeps nine parts to himself, and 
surrenders the tenth to another, inasmuch as the number ten is the sign 
of perfection, as being, in a sort, the terminus of all numbers which 
mount from one to ten, it follows that he who pays a tithe bears witness 
to his own imperfection and to the perfection of another. Now, to sin is 
due the imperfection of the human race, which needs to be perfected by 
Him who cleanses from sin. But to heal from sin belongs to Christ alone, 
for He is the "Lamb that taketh away the sin of the world" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++1%3A29">Jn. 1:29</a>), 
whose figure was Melchisedech, as the Apostle proves (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++7">Heb. 7</a>). Therefore 
by giving tithes to Melchisedech, Abraham foreshadowed that he, as being 
conceived in sin, and all who were to be his descendants in contracting 
original sin, needed that healing which is through Christ. And Isaac, 
Jacob, and Levi, and all the others were in Abraham in such a way so as 
to be descended from him, not only as to bodily substance, but also as to 
seminal virtue, by which original sin is transmitted. Consequently, they 
all paid tithes in Abraham, i.e. foreshadowed as needing to be healed by 
Christ. And Christ alone was in Abraham in such a manner as to descend 
from him, not by seminal virtue, but according to bodily substance. 
Therefore He was not in Abraham so as to need to be healed, but rather 
"as the balm with which the wound was to be healed." Therefore He did not 
pay tithes in Abraham's loins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[8] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the answer to the first objection is made manifest.
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Because the Blessed Virgin was conceived in original sin, 
she was in Abraham as needing to be healed. Therefore she paid tithes in 
him, as descending from him according to seminal virtue. But this is not 
true of Christ's body, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ's flesh is said to have been subject to sin, 
according as it was in the patriarchs, by reason of the  condition in 
which it was in His forefathers, who paid the tithes: but not by reason 
of its condition as actually in Christ, who did not pay the tithes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[31] A[8] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The levitical priesthood was handed down through carnal 
origin: wherefore it was not less in Abraham than in Levi. Consequently, 
since Abraham paid tithes to Melchisedech as to one greater than he, it 
follows that the priesthood of Melchisedech, inasmuch as he was a figure 
of Christ, was greater than that of Levi. But the priesthood of Christ 
does not result from carnal origin, but from spiritual grace. Therefore 
it is possible that a father pay tithes to a priest, as the less to the 
greater, and yet his son, if he be a bishop, is greater than that priest, 
not through carnal origin, but through the spiritual grace which he has 
received from Christ.<br>
