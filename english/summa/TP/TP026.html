    OF CHRIST AS CALLED THE MEDIATOR OF GOD AND MAN (TWO ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We have now to consider how Christ is called the Mediator of God and man,
    and under this head there are two points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP026.html#TPQ26A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is proper to Christ to
    be the Mediator of God and man?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="TP026.html#TPQ26A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether this belongs to Him by
    reason of His human nature?

    Whether it is proper to Christ to be the Mediator of God and man?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not proper to Christ to
    be the Mediator of God and man. For a priest and a prophet seem to be
    mediators between God and man, according to Dt. 5:5: "I was the mediator and
    stood between God [Vulg.: 'the Lord'] and you at that time." But it is not
    proper to Christ to be a priest and a prophet. Neither, therefore, is it
    proper to Him to be Mediator.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which is fitting to angels, both
    good and bad, cannot be said to be proper to Christ. But to be between God
    and man is fitting to the good angels, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). It
    is also fitting to the bad angels---that is, the demons: for they have
    something in common with God---namely, "immortality"; and something they
    have in common with men---namely, "passibility of soul" and consequently
    unhappiness; as appears from what Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 13,15).
    Therefore it is not proper to Christ to be a Mediator of God and man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it belongs to the office of Mediator to
    beseech one of those, between whom he mediates, for the other. But the Holy
    Ghost, as it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A26"
      >Rm. 8:26</a
    >), "asketh" God "for us with unspeakable groanings." Therefore the Holy
    Ghost is a Mediator between God and man. Therefore this is not proper to
    Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++2%3A5"
      >1 Tim. 2:5</a
    >): "There is... one Mediator of God and man, the man Christ Jesus."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Properly speaking, the office of a mediator is
    to join together and unite those between whom he mediates: for extremes are
    united in the mean [medio]. Now to unite men to God perfectively belongs to
    Christ, through Whom men are reconciled to God, according to 2 Cor. 5:19:
    "God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself." And, consequently,
    Christ alone is the perfect Mediator of God and men, inasmuch as, by His
    death, He reconciled the human race to God. Hence the Apostle, after saying,
    "Mediator of God and man, the man Christ Jesus," added: "Who gave Himself a
    redemption for all."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    However, nothing hinders certain others from being called mediators, in some
    respect, between God and man, forasmuch as they cooperate in uniting men to
    God, dispositively or ministerially.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The prophets and priests of the Old Law
    were called mediators between God and man, dispositively and ministerially:
    inasmuch as they foretold and foreshadowed the true and perfect Mediator of
    God and men. As to the priests of the New Law, they may be called mediators
    of God and men, inasmuch as they are the ministers of the true Mediator by
    administering, in His stead, the saving sacraments to men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The good angels, as Augustine says (De
    Civ. Dei ix, 13), cannot rightly be called mediators between God and men.
    "For since, in common with God, they have both beatitude and immortality,
    and none of these things in common with unhappy and mortal man, how much
    rather are they not aloof from men and akin to God, than established between
    them?" Dionysius, however, says that they do occupy a middle place, because,
    in the order of nature, they are established below God and above man.
    Moreover, they fulfill the office of mediator, not indeed principally and
  </p>
  <p>
    perfectively, but ministerially and dispositively: whence (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++4%3A11"
      >Mt. 4:11</a
    >) it is said that "angels came and ministered unto Him"---namely, Christ.
    As to the demons, it is true that they have immortality in common with God,
    and unhappiness in common with men. "Hence for this purpose does the
    immortal and unhappy demon intervene, in order that he may hinder men from
    passing to a happy immortality," and may allure them to an unhappy
    immortality. Whence he is like "an evil mediator, who separates friends"
    [*Augustine, De Civ. Dei xv].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But Christ had beatitude in common with God, mortality in common with men.
    Hence "for this purpose did He intervene, that having fulfilled the span of
    His mortality, He might from dead men make immortal---which He showed in
    Himself by rising again; and that He might confer beatitude on those who
    were deprived of it---for which reason He never forsook us." Wherefore He is
    "the good Mediator, Who reconciles enemies" (De Civ. Dei xv).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since the Holy Ghost is in everything
    equal to God, He cannot be said to be between, or a Mediator of, God and
    men: but Christ alone, Who, though equal to the Father in His Godhead, yet
    is less than the Father in His human nature, as stated above (<a
      href="TP020.html#TPQ20OUTP1"
      >Question [20]</a
    >, <a href="TP020.html#TPQ20A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence on Gal. 3:20,
    "Christ is a Mediator [Vulg.: 'Now a mediator is not of one, but God is
    one']," the gloss says: "Not the Father nor the Holy Ghost." The Holy Ghost,
    however, is said "to ask for us," because He makes us ask.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether Christ, is the Mediator of God and men?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ is not, as man, the
    Mediator of God and men. For Augustine says (Contra Felic. x): "One is the
    Person of Christ: lest there be not one Christ, not one substance; lest, the
    office of Mediator being denied, He be called the Son either of God alone,
    or merely the Son of a man." But He is the Son of God and man, not as man,
    but as at the same time God and man. Therefore neither should we say that,
    as man alone, He is Mediator of God and man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as Christ, as God, has a common
    nature with the Father and the Holy Ghost; so, as man, He has a common
    nature with men. But for the reason that, as God, He has the same nature as
    the Father and the Holy Ghost, He cannot be called Mediator, as God: for on
    1 Tim. 2:5, "Mediator of God and man," a gloss says: "As the Word, He is not
    a Mediator, because He is equal to God, and God 'with God,' and at the same
    time one God." Therefore neither, as man, can He be called Mediator, on
    account of His having the same nature as men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ is called Mediator, inasmuch as
    He reconciled us to God: and this He did by taking away sin, which separated
    us from God. But to take away sin belongs to Christ, not as man, but as God.
    Therefore Christ is our Mediator, not as man, but as God.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 15): "Not
    because He is the Word, is Christ Mediator, since He Who is supremely
    immortal and supremely happy is far from us unhappy mortals; but He is
    Mediator, as man."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We may consider two things in a mediator:
    first, that he is a mean; secondly, that he unites others. Now it is of the
    nature of a mean to be distant from each extreme: while it unites by
    communicating to one that which belongs to the other. Now neither of these
    can be applied to Christ as God, but only as man. For, as God, He does not
    differ from the Father and the Holy Ghost in nature and power of dominion:
    nor have the Father and the Holy Ghost anything that the Son has not, so
    that He be able to communicate to others something belonging to the Father
    or the Holy Ghost, as though it were belonging to others than Himself. But
    both can be applied to Him as man. Because, as man, He is distant both from
    God, by nature, and from man by dignity of both grace and glory. Again, it
    belongs to Him, as man, to unite men to God, by communicating to men both
    precepts and gifts, and by offering satisfaction and prayers to God for men.
    And therefore He is most truly called Mediator, as man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> If we take the Divine Nature from
    Christ, we consequently take from Him the singular fulness of grace, which
    belongs to Him as the Only-begotten of the Father, as it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A14"
      >Jn. 1:14</a
    >). From which fulness it resulted that He was established over all men, and
    approached nearer to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ, as God, is in all things equal
    to the Father. But even in the human nature He is above all men. Therefore,
    as man, He can be Mediator, but not as God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although it belongs to Christ as God to
    take away sin authoritatively, yet it belongs to Him, as man, to satisfy for
    the sin of the human race. And in this sense He is called the Mediator of
    God and men.<br />
