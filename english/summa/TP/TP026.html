</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now to consider how Christ is called the Mediator of God and 
man, and under this head there are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP026.html#TPQ26A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is proper to Christ to be the Mediator of God and man?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="TP026.html#TPQ26A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether this belongs to Him by reason of His human nature?

<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not proper to Christ to be the Mediator 
of God and man. For a priest and a prophet seem to be mediators between 
God and man, according to Dt. 5:5: "I was the mediator and stood between 
God [Vulg.: 'the Lord'] and you at that  time." But it is not proper to 
Christ to be a priest and a prophet. Neither, therefore, is it proper to 
Him to be Mediator.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which is fitting to angels, both good and bad, 
cannot be said to be proper to Christ. But to be between God and man is 
fitting to the good angels, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). It is also 
fitting to the bad angels---that is, the demons: for they have something 
in common with God---namely, "immortality"; and something they have in 
common with men---namely, "passibility of soul" and consequently 
unhappiness; as appears from what Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 13,15). 
Therefore it is not proper to Christ to be a Mediator of God and man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it belongs to the office of Mediator to beseech one of 
those, between whom he mediates, for the other. But the Holy Ghost, as it 
is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8:26">Rm. 8:26</a>), "asketh" God "for us with unspeakable groanings." 
Therefore the Holy Ghost is a Mediator between God and man. Therefore 
this is not proper to Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++2:5">1 Tim. 2:5</a>): "There is . . . one 
Mediator of God and man, the man Christ Jesus."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Properly speaking, the office of a mediator is to join 
together and unite those between whom he mediates: for extremes are 
united in the mean [medio]. Now to unite men to God perfectively belongs 
to Christ, through Whom men are reconciled to God, according to 2 Cor. 
5:19: "God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself." And, 
consequently, Christ alone is the perfect Mediator of God and men, 
inasmuch as, by His death, He reconciled the human race to God. Hence the 
Apostle, after saying, "Mediator of God and man, the man Christ Jesus," 
added: "Who gave Himself a redemption for all."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, nothing hinders certain others from being called mediators, in 
some respect, between God and man, forasmuch as they cooperate in uniting 
men to God, dispositively or ministerially.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The prophets and priests of the Old Law were called 
mediators between God and man, dispositively and ministerially: inasmuch 
as they foretold and foreshadowed the true and perfect Mediator of God 
and men. As to the priests of the New Law, they may be called mediators 
of God and men, inasmuch as they are the ministers of the true Mediator 
by administering, in His stead, the saving sacraments to men.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The good angels, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 13), 
cannot rightly be called mediators between God and men. "For since, in 
common with God, they have both beatitude and immortality, and none of 
these things in common with unhappy and mortal man, how much rather are 
they not aloof from men and akin to God, than established between them?" 
Dionysius, however, says that they do occupy a middle place, because, in 
the order of nature, they are established below God and above man. 
Moreover, they fulfill the office of mediator, not indeed principally and 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; perfectively, but ministerially and dispositively: whence (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++4:11">Mt. 4:11</a>) it 
is said that "angels came and ministered unto Him"---namely, Christ. As 
to the demons, it is true that they have immortality in common with God, 
and unhappiness in common with men. "Hence for this purpose does the 
immortal and unhappy demon intervene, in order that he may hinder men 
from passing to a happy immortality," and may allure them to an unhappy 
immortality. Whence he is like "an evil mediator, who separates friends" 
[*Augustine, De Civ. Dei xv].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But Christ had beatitude in common with God, mortality in common with 
men. Hence "for this purpose did He intervene, that having fulfilled the 
span of His mortality, He might from dead men make immortal---which He 
showed in Himself by rising again; and that He might confer beatitude on 
those who were deprived of it---for which reason He never forsook us." 
Wherefore He is "the good Mediator, Who reconciles enemies" (De Civ. Dei 
xv).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since the Holy Ghost is in everything equal to God, He 
cannot be said to be between, or a Mediator of, God and men: but Christ 
alone, Who, though equal to the Father in His Godhead, yet is less than 
the Father in His human nature, as stated above (<A Href="TP020.html#TPQ20OUTP1">Question [20]</a>, <A Href="TP020.html#TPQ20A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence on 
Gal. 3:20, "Christ is a Mediator [Vulg.: 'Now a mediator is not of one, 
but God is one']," the gloss says: "Not the Father nor the Holy Ghost." 
The Holy Ghost, however, is said "to ask for us," because He makes us ask.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ, is the Mediator of God and men?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ is not, as man, the Mediator of God and 
men. For Augustine says (Contra Felic. x): "One is the Person of Christ: 
lest there be not one Christ, not one substance; lest, the office of 
Mediator being denied, He be called the Son either of God alone, or 
merely the Son of a man." But He is the Son of God and man, not as man, 
but as at the same time God and man. Therefore neither should we say 
that, as man alone, He is Mediator of God and man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as Christ, as God, has a common nature with the 
Father and the Holy Ghost; so, as man, He has a common nature with men. 
But for the reason that, as God, He has the same nature as the Father and 
the Holy Ghost, He cannot be called Mediator, as God: for on 1 Tim. 2:5, 
"Mediator of God and man," a gloss says: "As the Word, He is not a 
Mediator, because He is equal to God, and God 'with God,' and at the same 
time one God." Therefore neither, as man, can He be called Mediator, on 
account of His having the same nature as men.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ is called Mediator, inasmuch as He reconciled us 
to God: and this He did by taking away sin, which separated us from God. 
But to take away sin belongs to Christ, not as man, but as God. Therefore 
Christ is our Mediator, not as man, but as God. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 15): "Not because He is 
the Word, is Christ Mediator, since He Who is supremely immortal and 
supremely happy is far from us unhappy mortals; but He is Mediator, as 
man."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We may consider two things in a mediator: first, that he 
is a mean; secondly, that he unites others. Now it is of the nature of a 
mean to be distant from each extreme: while it unites by communicating to 
one that which belongs to the other. Now neither of these can be applied 
to Christ as God, but only as man. For, as God, He does not differ from 
the Father and the Holy Ghost in nature and power of dominion: nor have 
the Father and the Holy Ghost anything that the Son has not, so that He 
be able to communicate to others something belonging to the Father or the 
Holy Ghost, as though it were belonging to others than Himself. But both 
can be applied to Him as man. Because, as man, He is distant both from 
God, by nature, and from man by dignity of both grace and glory. Again, 
it belongs to Him, as man, to unite men to God, by communicating to men 
both precepts and gifts, and by offering satisfaction and prayers to God 
for men. And therefore He is most truly called Mediator, as man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> If we take the Divine Nature from Christ, we consequently 
take from Him the singular fulness of grace, which belongs to Him as the 
Only-begotten of the Father, as it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++1:14">Jn. 1:14</a>). From which 
fulness it resulted that He was established over all men, and approached 
nearer to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ, as God, is in all things equal to the Father. But 
even in the human nature He is above all men. Therefore, as man, He can 
be Mediator, but not as God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[26] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although it belongs to Christ as God to take away sin 
authoritatively, yet it belongs to Him, as man, to satisfy for the sin of 
the human race. And in this sense He is called the Mediator of God and 
men.<br>
