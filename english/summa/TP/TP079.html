<H3 Align="Left">Whether grace is bestowed through this sacrament?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that grace is not bestowed through this sacrament. For 
this sacrament is spiritual nourishment. But nourishment is only given to 
the living. Therefore since the spiritual life is the effect of grace, 
this sacrament belongs only to one in the state of grace. Therefore grace 
is not bestowed through this sacrament for it to be had in the first 
instance. In like manner neither is it given so as grace may be 
increased, because spiritual growth belongs to the sacrament of 
Confirmation, as stated above (<A Href="TP072.html#TPQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="TP072.html#TPQ72A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Consequently, grace is not 
bestowed through this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, this sacrament is given as a spiritual refreshment. But 
spiritual refreshment seems to belong to the use of grace rather than to 
its bestowal. Therefore it seems that grace is not given through this 
sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as was said above (<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>, <A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), "Christ's body is 
offered up in this sacrament for the salvation of the body, and His blood 
for that of the soul." Now it is not the body which is the subject of 
grace, but the soul, as was shown in the FS, Question [110], Article [4]. Therefore 
grace is not bestowed through this sacrament, at least so far as the body 
is concerned.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++6%3A52">Jn. 6:52</a>): "The bread which I will give, 
is My flesh for the life of the world." But the spiritual life is the 
effect of grace. Therefore grace is bestowed through this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[1] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The effect of this sacrament ought to be considered, 
first of all and principally, from what is contained in this sacrament, 
which is Christ; Who, just as by coming into the world, He visibly 
bestowed the life of grace upon the world, according to Jn. 1:17: "Grace 
and truth came by Jesus Christ," so also, by coming sacramentally into 
man causes the life of grace, according to Jn. 6:58: "He that eateth Me, 
the same also shall live by Me." Hence Cyril says on Lk. 22:19: "God's 
life-giving Word by uniting Himself with His own flesh, made it to be 
productive of life. For it was becoming that He should be united somehow 
with bodies through His sacred flesh and precious blood, which we receive 
in a life-giving blessing in the bread and wine."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[1] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it is considered on the part of what is represented by this 
sacrament, which is Christ's Passion, as stated above (<A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>, <A Href="TP074.html#TPQ74A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1). And therefore this sacrament works in man the effect which 
Christ's Passion wrought in the world. Hence, Chrysostom says on the 
words, "Immediately there came out blood and water" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++19%3A34">Jn. 19:34</a>): "Since 
the sacred mysteries derive their origin from thence, when you draw nigh 
to the awe-inspiring chalice, so approach as if you were going to drink 
from Christ's own side."  Hence our Lord Himself says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++26%3A28">Mt. 26:28</a>): "This 
is My blood . . . which shall be shed for many unto the remission of 
sins."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[1] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the effect of this sacrament is considered from the way in 
which this sacrament is given; for it is given by way of food and drink. 
And therefore this sacrament does for the spiritual life all that 
material food does for the bodily life, namely, by sustaining, giving 
increase, restoring, and giving delight. Accordingly, Ambrose says (De 
Sacram. v): "This is the bread of everlasting life, which supports the 
substance of our soul." And Chrysostom says (Hom. xlvi in Joan.): "When 
we desire it, He lets us feel Him, and eat Him, and embrace Him." And 
hence our Lord says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++6%3A56">Jn. 6:56</a>): "My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is 
drink indeed."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[1] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, the effect of this sacrament is considered from the species 
under which it is given. Hence Augustine says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.): 
"Our Lord betokened His body and blood in things which out of many units 
are made into some one whole: for out of many grains is one thing made," 
viz. bread; "and many grapes flow into one thing," viz. wine. And 
therefore he observes elsewhere (Tract. xxvi in Joan.): "O sacrament of 
piety, O sign of unity, O bond of charity!"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[1] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And since Christ and His Passion are the cause of grace. and since 
spiritual refreshment, and charity cannot be without grace, it is clear 
from all that has been set forth that this sacrament bestows grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This sacrament has of itself the power of bestowing grace; 
nor does anyone possess grace before receiving this sacrament except from 
some desire thereof; from his own desire, as in the case of the adult. or 
from the Church's desire in the case of children, as stated above (<A Href="TP073.html#TPQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="TP073.html#TPQ73A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Hence it is due to the efficacy of its power, that even from 
desire thereof a man procures grace whereby he is enabled to lead the 
spiritual life. It remains, then, that when the sacrament itself is 
really received, grace is increased, and the spiritual life perfected: 
yet in different fashion from the sacrament of Confirmation, in which 
grace is increased and perfected for resisting the outward assaults of 
Christ's enemies. But by this sacrament grace receives increase, and the 
spiritual life is perfected, so that man may stand perfect in himself by 
union with God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This sacrament confers grace spiritually together with the 
virtue of charity. Hence Damascene (De Fide Orth. iv) compares this 
sacrament to the burning coal which Isaias saw (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++6%3A6">Is. 6:6</a>): "For a live 
ember is not simply wood, but wood united to fire; so also the bread of 
communion is not simple bread but bread united with the Godhead." But as 
Gregory observes in a Homily for Pentecost, "God's love is never idle; 
for, wherever it is it does great works." And consequently through this 
sacrament, as far as its power is concerned, not only is the habit of 
grace and of virtue bestowed, but it is furthermore aroused to act, 
according to  2 Cor. 5:14: "The charity of Christ presseth us." Hence it 
is that the soul is spiritually nourished through the power of this 
sacrament, by being spiritually gladdened, and as it were inebriated with 
the sweetness of the Divine goodness, according to Cant 5:1: "Eat, O 
friends, and drink, and be inebriated, my dearly beloved."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Because the sacraments operate according to the similitude 
by which they signify, therefore by way of assimilation it is said that 
in this sacrament "the body is offered for the salvation of the body, and 
the blood for the salvation of the soul," although each works for the 
salvation of both, since the entire Christ is under each, as stated above 
(<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). And although the body is not the immediate subject of 
grace, still the effect of grace flows into the body while in the present 
life we present "our [Vulg.: 'your'] members" as "instruments of justice 
unto God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++6%3A13">Rm. 6:13</a>), and in the life to come our body will share in the 
incorruption and the glory of the soul.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the attaining of glory is an effect of this sacrament?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the attaining of glory is not an effect of this 
sacrament. For an effect is proportioned to its cause. But this sacrament 
belongs to "wayfarers" [viatoribus], and hence it is termed "Viaticum." 
Since, then, wayfarers are not yet capable of glory, it seems that this 
sacrament does not cause the attaining of glory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, given sufficient cause, the effect follows. But many 
take this sacrament who will never come to glory, as Augustine declares 
(De Civ. Dei xxi). Consequently, this sacrament is not the cause of 
attaining unto glory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the greater is not brought about by the lesser, for 
nothing acts outside its species. But it is the lesser thing to receive 
Christ under a strange species, which happens in this sacrament, than to 
enjoy Him in His own species, which belongs to glory. Therefore this 
sacrament does not cause the attaining of glory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++6%3A52">Jn. 6:52</a>): "If any man eat of this 
bread, he shall live for ever." But eternal life is the life of glory. 
Therefore the attaining of glory is an effect of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In this sacrament we may consider both that from which it 
derives its effect, namely, Christ contained in it, as also His Passion 
represented by it; and that through which it works its effect, namely, 
the use of the sacrament, and its species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now as to both of these it belongs to this sacrament to cause the 
attaining of eternal life. Because it was by His Passion that  Christ 
opened to us the approach to eternal life, according to Heb. 9:15: "He is 
the Mediator of the New Testament; that by means of His death . . . they 
that are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance." 
Accordingly in the form of this sacrament it is said: "This is the 
chalice of My blood, of the New and Eternal Testament."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner the refreshment of spiritual food and the unity denoted 
by the species of the bread and wine are to be had in the present life, 
although imperfectly. but perfectly in the state of glory. Hence 
Augustine says on the words, "My flesh is meat indeed" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++6%3A56">Jn. 6:56</a>): 
"Seeing that in meat and drink, men aim at this, that they hunger not nor 
thirst, this verily nought doth afford save only this meat and drink 
which maketh them who partake thereof to be immortal and incorruptible, 
in the fellowship of the saints, where shall be peace, and unity, full 
and perfect."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Christ's Passion, in virtue whereof this sacrament is 
accomplished, is indeed the sufficient cause of glory, yet not so that we 
are thereby forthwith admitted to glory, but we must first "suffer with 
Him in order that we may also be glorified" afterwards "with Him" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A17">Rm. 8:17</a>), so this sacrament does not at once admit us to glory, but bestows 
on us the power of coming unto glory. And therefore it is called 
"Viaticum," a figure whereof we read in 3 Kgs. 19:8: "Elias ate and 
drank, and walked in the strength of that food forty days and forty 
nights unto the mount of God, Horeb."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as Christ's Passion has not its effect in them who are 
not disposed towards it as they should be, so also they do not come to 
glory through this sacrament who receive it unworthily. Hence Augustine 
(Tract. xxvi in Joan.), expounding the same passage, observes: "The 
sacrament is one thing, the power of the sacrament another. Many receive 
it from the altar . . . and by receiving" . . . die . . . Eat, then, 
spiritually the heavenly "bread, bring innocence to the altar." It is no 
wonder, then, if those who do not keep innocence, do not secure the 
effect of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That Christ is received under another species belongs to 
the nature of a sacrament, which acts instrumentally. But there is 
nothing to prevent an instrumental cause from producing a more mighty 
effect, as is evident from what was said above (<A Href="TP077.html#TPQ77OUTP1">Question [77]</a>, <A Href="TP077.html#TPQ77A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 3).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the forgiveness of mortal sin is an effect of this sacrament?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the forgiveness of mortal sin is an effect of this 
sacrament. For it is said in one of the Collects (Postcommunion, Pro 
vivis et defunctis): "May this sacrament be a cleansing from crimes." But 
mortal sins are called crimes. Therefore mortal sins are blotted out by 
this sacrament. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, this sacrament, like Baptism, works by the power of 
Christ's Passion. But mortal sins are forgiven by Baptism, as stated 
above (<A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>, <A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore they are forgiven likewise by this 
sacrament, especially since in the form of this sacrament it is said: 
"Which shall be shed for many unto the forgiveness of sins."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, grace is bestowed through this sacrament, as stated 
above (<A Href="TP079.html#TPQ79A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But by grace a man is justified from mortal sins, according 
to Rm. 3:24: "Being justified freely by His grace." Therefore mortal sins 
are forgiven by this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++11%3A29">1 Cor. 11:29</a>): "He that eateth and 
drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself": and a 
gloss of the same passage makes the following commentary: "He eats and 
drinks unworthily who is in the state of sin, or who handles (the 
sacrament) irreverently; and such a one eats and drinks judgment, i.e. 
damnation, unto himself." Therefore, he that is in mortal sin, by taking 
the sacrament heaps sin upon sin, rather than obtains forgiveness of his 
sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The power of this sacrament can be considered in two 
ways. First of all, in itself: and thus this sacrament has from Christ's 
Passion the power of forgiving all sins, since the Passion is the fount 
and cause of the forgiveness of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it can be considered in comparison with the recipient of the 
sacrament, in so far as there is, or is not, found in him an obstacle to 
receiving the fruit of this sacrament. Now whoever is conscious of mortal 
sin, has within him an obstacle to receiving the effect of this 
sacrament; since he is not a proper recipient of this sacrament, both 
because he is not alive spiritually, and so he ought not to eat the 
spiritual nourishment, since nourishment is confined to the living; and 
because he cannot be united with Christ, which is the effect of this 
sacrament, as long as he retains an attachment towards mortal sin. 
Consequently, as is said in the book De Eccles. Dogm.: "If the soul leans 
towards sin, it is burdened rather than purified from partaking of the 
Eucharist." Hence, in him who is conscious of mortal sin, this sacrament 
does not cause the forgiveness of sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless this sacrament can effect the forgiveness of sin in two 
ways. First of all, by being received, not actually, but in desire; as 
when a man is first justified from sin. Secondly, when received by one in 
mortal sin of which he is not conscious, and for which he has no 
attachment; since possibly he was not sufficiently contrite at first, but 
by approaching this sacrament devoutly and reverently he obtains the 
grace of charity, which will perfect his contrition and bring forgiveness 
of sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We ask that this sacrament may be the "cleansing of 
crimes," or of those sins of which we are unconscious, according to Ps. 
18:13: "Lord, cleanse me from my hidden sins"; or that our  contrition 
may be perfected for the forgiveness of our sins; or that strength be 
bestowed on us to avoid sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Baptism is spiritual generation, which is a transition from 
spiritual non-being into spiritual being, and is given by way of 
ablution. Consequently, in both respects he who is conscious of mortal 
sin does not improperly approach Baptism. But in this sacrament man 
receives Christ within himself by way of spiritual nourishment, which is 
unbecoming to one that lies dead in his sins. Therefore the comparison 
does not hold good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Grace is the sufficient cause of the forgiveness of mortal 
sin; yet it does not forgive sin except when it is first bestowed on the 
sinner. But it is not given so in this sacrament. Hence the argument does 
not prove.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether venial sins are forgiven through this sacrament?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that venial sins are not forgiven by this sacrament, 
because this is the "sacrament of charity," as Augustine says (Tract. 
xxvi in Joan.). But venial sins are not contrary to charity, as was shown 
in the FS, Question [88], Articles [1],2; SS, Question [24], Article [10]. Therefore, since contrary is 
taken away by its contrary, it seems that venial sins are not forgiven by 
this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if venial sins be forgiven by this sacrament, then all 
of them are forgiven for the same reason as one is. But it does not 
appear that all are forgiven, because thus one might frequently be 
without any venial sin, against what is said in 1 Jn. 1:8: "If we say 
that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves." Therefore no venial sin is 
forgiven by this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, contraries mutually exclude each other. But venial sins 
do not forbid the receiving of this sacrament: because Augustine says on 
the words, "If any man eat of it he shall [Vulg.: 'may'] not die for 
ever" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++6%3A50">Jn. 6:50</a>): "Bring innocence to the altar: your sins, though they 
be daily . . . let them not be deadly." Therefore neither are venial sins 
taken away by this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Innocent III says (De S. Alt. Myst. iv) that this 
sacrament "blots out venial sins, and wards off mortal sins."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Two things may be considered in this sacrament, to wit, 
the sacrament itself, and the reality of the sacrament: and it appears 
from both that this sacrament has the power of forgiving venial sins. For 
this sacrament is received under the form of nourishing food. Now 
nourishment from food is requisite for the body to make good the daily 
waste caused by the action of natural heat. But something is also lost 
daily of our spirituality from the heat of concupiscence through venial 
sins, which lessen the fervor of charity, as was shown in the SS, Question [24], 
Article [10]. And therefore it belongs to this sacrament to forgive venial sins. 
Hence Ambrose says (De Sacram. v) that this daily bread is taken "as a 
remedy  against daily infirmity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The reality of this sacrament is charity, not only as to its habit, but 
also as to its act, which is kindled in this sacrament; and by this means 
venial sins are forgiven. Consequently, it is manifest that venial sins 
are forgiven by the power of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Venial sins, although not opposed to the habit of charity, 
are nevertheless opposed to the fervor of its act, which act is kindled 
by this sacrament; by reason of which act venial sins are blotted out.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The passage quoted is not to be understood as if a man 
could not at some time be without all guilt of venial sin: but that the 
just do not pass through this life without committing venial sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The power of charity, to which this sacrament belongs, is 
greater than that of venial sins: because charity by its act takes away 
venial sins, which nevertheless cannot entirely hinder the act of 
charity. And the same holds good of this sacrament.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the entire punishment due to sin is forgiven through this sacrament?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the entire punishment due to sin is forgiven 
through this sacrament. For through this sacrament man receives the 
effect of Christ's Passion within himself as stated above (<A Href="TP079.html#TPQ79ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), just 
as he does through Baptism. But through Baptism man receives forgiveness 
of all punishment, through the virtue of Christ's Passion, which 
satisfied sufficiently for all sins, as was explained above (<A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>, <A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore it seems the whole debt of punishment is forgiven through 
this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Pope Alexander I says (Ep. ad omnes orth.): "No 
sacrifice can be greater than the body and the blood of Christ." But man 
satisfied for his sins by the sacrifices of the old Law: for it is 
written (Lev. 4,5): "If a man shall sin, let him offer" (so and so) "for 
his sin, and it shall be forgiven him." Therefore this sacrament avails 
much more for the forgiveness of all punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is certain that some part of the debt of punishment 
is forgiven by this sacrament; for which reason it is sometimes enjoined 
upon a man, by way of satisfaction, to have masses said for himself. But 
if one part of the punishment is forgiven, for the same reason is the 
other forgiven: owing to Christ's infinite power contained in this 
sacrament. Consequently, it seems that the whole punishment can be taken 
away by this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In that case no other punishment would have to be 
enjoined; just as none is imposed upon the newly baptized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[5] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> This sacrament is both a sacrifice and a sacrament. it 
has the nature of a sacrifice inasmuch as it is offered up; and it has 
the nature of a sacrament inasmuch as it is received. And therefore it 
has the effect of a sacrament in the recipient, and the effect of a 
sacrifice in the offerer, or in them for whom it is offered.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[5] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, then, it be considered as a sacrament, it produces its effect in two 
ways: first of all directly through the power of the sacrament; secondly 
as by a kind of concomitance, as was said above regarding what is 
contained in the sacrament (<A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="TP076.html#TPQ76ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Through the power of the 
sacrament it produces directly that effect for which it was instituted. 
Now it was instituted not for satisfaction, but for nourishing 
spiritually through union between Christ and His members, as nourishment 
is united with the person nourished. But because this union is the effect 
of charity, from the fervor of which man obtains forgiveness, not only of 
guilt but also of punishment, hence it is that as a consequence, and by 
concomitance with the chief effect, man obtains forgiveness of the 
punishment, not indeed of the entire punishment, but according to the 
measure of his devotion and fervor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[5] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in so far as it is a sacrifice, it has a satisfactory power. Yet in 
satisfaction, the affection of the offerer is weighed rather than the 
quantity of the offering. Hence our Lord says (Mk. 12:43: cf. Lk. 21:4) 
of the widow who offered "two mites" that she "cast in more than all." 
Therefore, although this offering suffices of its own quantity to satisfy 
for all punishment, yet it becomes satisfactory for them for whom it is 
offered, or even for the offerers, according to the measure of their 
devotion, and not for the whole punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The sacrament of Baptism is directly ordained for the 
remission of punishment and guilt: not so the Eucharist, because Baptism 
is given to man as dying with Christ, whereas the Eucharist is given as 
by way of nourishing and perfecting him through Christ. Consequently 
there is no parallel.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those other sacrifices and oblations did not effect the 
forgiveness of the whole punishment, neither as to the quantity of the 
thing offered, as this sacrament does, nor as to personal devotion; from 
which it comes to pass that even here the whole punishment is not taken 
away.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If part of the punishment and not the whole be taken away 
by this sacrament, it is due to a defect not on the part of Christ's 
power, but on the part of man's devotion.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether man is preserved by this sacrament from future sins?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that man is not preserved by this sacrament from future 
sins. For there are many that receive this sacrament worthily, who 
afterwards fall into sin. Now this would not happen if this sacrament 
were to preserve them from future sins. Consequently, it is not an effect 
of this sacrament to preserve from future sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Eucharist is the sacrament of charity, as stated 
above (<A Href="TP079.html#TPQ79A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But charity does not seem to preserve from future sins, 
because it can be lost through sin after one has possessed it, as was 
stated in the SS, Question [24], Article [11]. Therefore it seems that this sacrament 
does not preserve man from sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the origin of sin within us is "the law of sin, which is 
in our members," as declared by the Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++7%3A23">Rm. 7:23</a>). But the lessening 
of the fomes, which is the law of sin, is set down as an effect not of 
this sacrament, but rather of Baptism. Therefore preservation from sin is 
not an effect of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++6%3A50">Jn. 6:50</a>): "This is the bread which 
cometh down from heaven; that if any man eat of it, he may not die": 
which manifestly is not to be understood of the death of the body. 
Therefore it is to be understood that this sacrament preserves from 
spiritual death, which is through sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sin is the spiritual death of the soul. Hence man is 
preserved from future sin in the same way as the body is preserved from 
future death of the body: and this happens in two ways. First of all, in 
so far as man's nature is strengthened inwardly against inner decay, and 
so by means of food and medicine he is preserved from death. Secondly, by 
being guarded against outward assaults; and thus he is protected by means 
of arms by which he defends his body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this sacrament preserves man from sin in both of these ways. For, 
first of all, by uniting man with Christ through grace, it strengthens 
his spiritual life, as spiritual food and spiritual medicine, according 
to Ps. 103:5: "(That) bread strengthens [Vulg.: 'may strengthen'] man's 
heart." Augustine likewise says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.): "Approach without 
fear; it is bread, not poison." Secondly, inasmuch as it is a sign of 
Christ's Passion, whereby the devils are conquered, it repels all the 
assaults of demons. Hence Chrysostom says (Hom. xlvi in Joan.): "Like 
lions breathing forth fire, thus do we depart from that table, being made 
terrible to the devil."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The effect of this sacrament is received according to man's 
condition: such is the case with every active cause in that its effect is 
received in matter according to the condition of the matter. But such is 
the condition of man on earth that his free-will can be bent to good or 
evil. Hence, although this sacrament of itself has the power of 
preserving from sin, yet it does not take away from man the possibility 
of sinning.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even charity of itself keeps man from sin, according to Rm. 
13:10: "The love of our neighbor worketh no evil": but it is due to the 
mutability of free-will that a man sins after possessing charity, just as 
after receiving this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although this sacrament is not ordained directly to lessen 
the fomes, yet it does lessen it as a consequence, inasmuch as it 
increases charity, because, as Augustine says (<A Href="TP083.html#TPQ83OUTP1">Question [83]</a>), "the increase of 
charity is the lessening of concupiscence." But it directly strengthens 
man's heart in good; whereby he is also preserved from sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether this sacrament benefit others besides the recipients?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that this sacrament benefits only the recipients. For 
this sacrament is of the same genus as the other sacraments, being one of 
those into which that genus is divided. But the other sacraments only 
benefit the recipients; thus the baptized person alone receives effect of 
Baptism. Therefore, neither does this sacrament benefit others than the 
recipients.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the effects of this sacrament are the attainment of 
grace and glory, and the forgiveness of sin, at least of venial sin. If 
therefore this sacrament were to produce its effects in others besides 
the recipients, a man might happen to acquire grace and glory and 
forgiveness of sin without doing or receiving anything himself, through 
another receiving or offering this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, when the cause is multiplied, the effect is likewise 
multiplied. If therefore this sacrament benefit others besides the 
recipients, it would follow that it benefits a man more if he receive 
this sacrament through many hosts being consecrated in one mass, whereas 
this is not the Church's custom: for instance, that many receive 
communion for the salvation of one individual. Consequently, it does not 
seem that this sacrament benefits anyone but the recipient.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Prayer is made for many others during the celebration 
of this sacrament; which would serve no purpose were the sacrament not 
beneficial to others. Therefore, this sacrament is beneficial not merely 
to them who receive it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[7] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP079.html#TPQ79A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), this sacrament is not only a 
sacrament, but also a sacrifice. For, it has the nature of a sacrifice 
inasmuch as in this sacrament Christ's Passion is represented, whereby 
Christ "offered Himself a Victim to God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++5%3A2">Eph. 5:2</a>), and it has the 
nature of a sacrament inasmuch as invisible grace is bestowed in this 
sacrament under a visible species. So, then, this sacrament benefits 
recipients by way both of sacrament and of sacrifice, because it is 
offered for all who partake of it. For it is said in the Canon of the 
Mass: "May as many of us as, by participation at this Altar, shall 
receive the most sacred body and  blood of Thy Son, be filled with all 
heavenly benediction and grace."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[7] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But to others who do not receive it, it is beneficial by way of 
sacrifice, inasmuch as it is offered for their salvation. Hence it is 
said in the Canon of the Mass: "Be mindful, O Lord, of Thy servants, men 
and women . . . for whom we offer, or who offer up to Thee, this 
sacrifice of praise for themselves and for all their own, for the 
redemption of their souls, for the hope of their safety and salvation." 
And our Lord expressed both ways, saying (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++26%3A28,+with+Lk++22:20">Mt. 26:28, with Lk. 22:20</a>): 
"Which for you," i.e. who receive it, "and for many," i.e. others, "shall 
be shed unto remission of sins."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This sacrament has this in addition to the others, that it 
is a sacrifice: and therefore the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Christ's Passion benefits all, for the forgiveness of 
sin and the attaining of grace and glory, whereas it produces no effect 
except in those who are united with Christ's Passion through faith and 
charity, so likewise this sacrifice, which is the memorial of our Lord's 
Passion, has no effect except in those who are united with this sacrament 
through faith and charity. Hence Augustine says to Renatus (De Anima et 
ejus origine i): "Who may offer Christ's body except for them who are 
Christ's members?" Hence in the Canon of the Mass no prayer is made for 
them who are outside the pale of the Church. But it benefits them who are 
members, more or less, according to the measure of their devotion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Receiving is of the very nature of the sacrament, but 
offering belongs to the nature of sacrifice: consequently, when one or 
even several receive the body of Christ, no help accrues to others. In 
like fashion even when the priest consecrates several hosts in one mass, 
the effect of this sacrament is not increased, since there is only one 
sacrifice; because there is no more power in several hosts than in one, 
since there is only one Christ present under all the hosts and under one. 
Hence, neither will any one receive greater effect from the sacrament by 
taking many consecrated hosts in one mass. But the oblation of the 
sacrifice is multiplied in several masses, and therefore the effect of 
the sacrifice and of the sacrament is multiplied.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the effect of this sacrament is hindered by venial sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the effect of this sacrament is not hindered by 
venial sin. For Augustine (Tract. xxvi in Joan.), commenting on Jn. 6:52, 
"If any man eat of this bread," etc., says: "Eat the heavenly bread 
spiritually; bring innocence to the altar; your sins, though they be 
daily, let them not be deadly." From this it is evident that venial sins, 
which are called daily sins, do not prevent spiritual eating. But they 
who eat spiritually, receive the effect of this sacrament. Therefore, 
venial sins do not hinder the  effect of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, this sacrament is not less powerful than Baptism. But, 
as stated above (<A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>, <A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69ATHEP1">Articles [9]</a>,10), only pretense checks the effect of 
Baptism, and venial sins do not belong to pretense; because according to 
Wis. 1:5: "the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful," 
yet He is not put to flight by venial sins. Therefore neither do venial 
sins hinder the effect of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing which is removed by the action of any cause, can 
hinder the effect of such cause. But venial sins are taken away by this 
sacrament. Therefore, they do not hinder its effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv): "The fire of that 
desire which is within us, being kindled by the burning coal," i.e. this 
sacrament, "will consume our sins, and enlighten our hearts, so that we 
shall be inflamed and made godlike." But the fire of our desire or love 
is hindered by venial sins, which hinder the fervor of charity, as was 
shown in the FS, Question [81], Article [4]; SS, Question [24], Article [10]. Therefore venial sins 
hinder the effect of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Venial sins can be taken in two ways: first of all as 
past, secondly as in the act of being committed. Venial sins taken in the 
first way do not in any way hinder the effect of this sacrament. For it 
can come to pass that after many venial sins a man may approach devoutly 
to this sacrament and fully secure its effect. Considered in the second 
way venial sins do not utterly hinder the effect of this sacrament, but 
merely in part. For, it has been stated above (<A Href="TP079.html#TPQ79A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), that the effect of 
this sacrament is not only the obtaining of habitual grace or charity, 
but also a certain actual refreshment of spiritual sweetness: which is 
indeed hindered if anyone approach to this sacrament with mind distracted 
through venial sins; but the increase of habitual grace or of charity is 
not taken away.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> He that approaches this sacrament with actual venial sin, 
eats spiritually indeed, in habit but not in act: and therefore he shares 
in the habitual effect of the sacrament, but not in its actual effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Baptism is not ordained, as this sacrament is, for the 
fervor of charity as its actual effect. Because Baptism is spiritual 
regeneration, through which the first perfection is acquired, which is a 
habit or form; but this sacrament is spiritual eating, which has actual 
delight.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[79] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument deals with past venial sins, which are taken 
away by this sacrament.<br>
