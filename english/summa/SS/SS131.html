<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that ambition is not a sin. For ambition denotes the 
desire of honor. Now honor is in itself a good thing, and the greatest of 
external goods: wherefore those who care not for honor are reproved. 
Therefore ambition is not a sin; rather is it something deserving of 
praise, in so far as a good is laudably desired.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, anyone may, without sin, desire what is due to him as a 
reward. Now honor is the reward of virtue, as the Philosopher states 
(Ethic. i, 12; iv, 3; viii, 14). Therefore ambition of honor is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which heartens a man to do good and disheartens him 
from doing evil, is not a sin. Now honor heartens men to do good and to 
avoid evil; thus the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 8) that "with the 
bravest men, cowards are held in dishonor, and the brave in honor": and 
Tully says (De Tusc. Quaest. i) that "honor fosters the arts." Therefore 
ambition is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++13:5">1 Cor. 13:5</a>) that "charity is not 
ambitious, seeketh not her own." Now nothing is contrary to charity, 
except sin. Therefore ambition is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS103.html#SSQ103OUTP1">Question [103]</a>, <A Href="SS103.html#SSQ103ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), honor denotes 
reverence shown to a person in witness of his excellence. Now two things 
have to be considered with regard to man's honor. The first is that a man 
has not from himself the thing in which he excels, for this is, as it 
were, something Divine in him, wherefore on this count honor is due 
principally, not to him but to God. The second point that calls for 
observation is that the thing in which man excels is given to him by God, 
that he may profit others thereby: wherefore a man ought so far to be 
pleased that others bear witness to his excellence, as this enables him 
to profit others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the desire of honor may be inordinate in three ways.  First, when a 
man desires recognition of an excellence which he has not: this is to 
desire more than his share of honor. Secondly, when a man desires honor 
for himself without referring it to God. Thirdly, when a man's appetite 
rests in honor itself, without referring it to the profit of others. 
Since then ambition denotes inordinate desire of honor, it is evident 
that it is always a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The desire for good should be regulated according to 
reason, and if it exceed this rule it will be sinful. In this way it is 
sinful to desire honor in disaccord with the order of reason. Now those 
are reproved who care not for honor in accordance with reason's dictate 
that they should avoid what is contrary to honor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Honor is not the reward of virtue, as regards the virtuous 
man, in this sense that he should seek for it as his reward: since the 
reward he seeks is happiness, which is the end of virtue. But it is said 
to be the reward of virtue as regards others, who have nothing greater 
than honor whereby to reward the virtuous; which honor derives greatness 
from the very fact that it bears witness to virtue. Hence it is evident 
that it is not an adequate reward, as stated in Ethic. iv, 3.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as some are heartened to do good and disheartened from 
doing evil, by the desire of honor, if this be desired in due measure; 
so, if it be desired inordinately, it may become to man an occasion of 
doing many evil things, as when a man cares not by what means he obtains 
honor. Wherefore Sallust says (Catilin.) that "the good as well as the 
wicked covet honors for themselves, but the one," i.e. the good, "go 
about it in the right way," whereas "the other," i.e. the wicked, 
"through lack of the good arts, make use of deceit and falsehood." Yet 
they who, merely for the sake of honor, either do good or avoid evil, are 
not virtuous, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 8), where he says 
that they who do brave things for the sake of honor are not truly brave.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that ambition is not opposed to magnanimity by excess. 
For one mean has only one extreme opposed to it on the one side. Now 
presumption is opposed to magnanimity by excess as stated above (<A Href="SS130.html#SSQ130OUTP1">Question [130]</a>, <A Href="SS130.html#SSQ130A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore ambition is not opposed to it by excess.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, magnanimity is about honors; whereas ambition seems to 
regard positions of dignity: for it is written (2 Macc. 4:7) that "Jason 
ambitiously sought the high priesthood." Therefore ambition is not 
opposed to magnanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, ambition seems to regard outward show: for it is written 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Acts+25:27">Acts 25:27</a>) that "Agrippa and Berenice . . . with great pomp 
[ambitione]. . . had entered into the hall of audience"  [*'Praetorium.' 
The Vulgate has 'auditorium,' but the meaning is the same], and (2 Para. 
16:14) that when Asa died they "burned spices and . . . ointments over 
his body" with very great pomp [ambitione]. But magnanimity is not about 
outward show. Therefore ambition is not opposed to magnanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully says (De Offic. i) that "the more a man exceeds 
in magnanimity, the more he desires himself alone to dominate others." 
But this pertains to ambition. Therefore ambition denotes an excess of 
magnanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS131.html#SSQ131A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), ambition signifies inordinate 
love of honor. Now magnanimity is about honors and makes use of them in a 
becoming manner. Wherefore it is evident that ambition is opposed to 
magnanimity as the inordinate to that which is well ordered.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Magnanimity regards two things. It regards one as its end, 
in so far as it is some great deed that the magnanimous man attempts in 
proportion to his ability. In this way presumption is opposed to 
magnanimity by excess: because the presumptuous man attempts great deeds 
beyond his ability. The other thing that magnanimity regards is its 
matter, viz. honor, of which it makes right use: and in this way ambition 
is opposed to magnanimity by excess. Nor is it impossible for one mean to 
be exceeded in various respects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Honor is due to those who are in a position of dignity, on 
account of a certain excellence of their estate: and accordingly 
inordinate desire for positions of dignity pertains to ambition. For if a 
man were to have an inordinate desire for a position of dignity, not for 
the sake of honor, but for the sake of a right use of a dignity exceeding 
his ability, he would not be ambitious but presumptuous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[131] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The very solemnity of outward worship is a kind of honor, 
wherefore in such cases honor is wont to be shown. This is signified by 
the words of James 2:2,3: "If there shall come into your assembly a man 
having a golden ring, in fine apparel . . . and you . . . shall say to 
him: Sit thou here well," etc. Wherefore ambition does not regard outward 
worship, except in so far as this is a kind of honor.<br>
