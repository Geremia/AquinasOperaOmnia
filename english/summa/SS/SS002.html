  <h3 align="center">OF THE ACT OF FAITH (TEN ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the act of faith, and (1) the internal act; (2) the
    external act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are ten points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS002.html#SSQ2A1THEP1">(1)</a> What is "to believe," which is the
    internal act of faith?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS002.html#SSQ2A2THEP1">(2)</a> In how many ways is it expressed?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS002.html#SSQ2A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is necessary for
    salvation to believe in anything above natural reason?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS002.html#SSQ2A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is necessary to believe
    those things that are attainable by natural reason?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS002.html#SSQ2A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether it is necessary for
    salvation to believe certain things explicitly?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS002.html#SSQ2A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether all are equally bound to
    explicit faith?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS002.html#SSQ2A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether explicit faith in Christ is
    always necessary for salvation?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS002.html#SSQ2A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether it is necessary for
    salvation to believe in the Trinity explicitly?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS002.html#SSQ2A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether the act of faith is
    meritorious?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS002.html#SSQ2A10THEP1">(10)</a> Whether human reason diminishes
    the merit of faith?

  <h3 align="left">Whether to believe is to think with assent?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that to believe is not to think
    with assent. Because the Latin word "cogitatio" [thought] implies a
    research, for "cogitare" [to think] seems to be equivalent to "coagitare,"
    i.e. "to discuss together." Now Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv) that faith
    is "an assent without research." Therefore thinking has no place in the act
    of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, faith resides in the reason, as we shall
    show further on (<a href="SS004.html#SSQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>,
    <a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now to think is an act of
    the cogitative power, which belongs to the sensitive faculty, as stated in
    the FP, Question [78], Article [4]. Therefore thought has nothing to do with
    faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to believe is an act of the intellect,
    since its object is truth. But assent seems to be an act not of the
    intellect, but of the will, even as consent is, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS015.html#FSQ15OUTP1">Question [15]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS015.html#FSQ15A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3). Therefore to
    believe is not to think with assent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> This is how "to believe" is defined by
    Augustine (De Praedest. Sanct. ii).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> "To think" can be taken in three ways. First,
    in a general way for any kind of actual consideration of the intellect, as
    Augustine observes (De Trin. xiv, 7): "By understanding I mean now the
    faculty whereby we understand when thinking." Secondly, "to think" is more
    strictly taken for that consideration of the intellect, which is accompanied
    by some kind of inquiry, and which precedes the intellect's arrival at the
    stage of perfection that comes with the certitude of sight. In this sense
    Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 16) that "the Son of God is not called the
    Thought, but the Word of God. When our thought realizes what we know and
    takes form therefrom, it becomes our word. Hence the Word of God must be
    understood without any thinking on the part of God, for there is nothing
    there that can take form, or be unformed." In this way thought is, properly
    speaking, the movement of the mind while yet deliberating, and not yet
    perfected by the clear sight of truth. Since, however, such a movement of
    the mind may be one of deliberation either about universal notions, which
    belongs to the intellectual faculty, or about particular matters, which
    belongs to the sensitive part, hence it is that "to think" is taken secondly
    for an act of the deliberating intellect, and thirdly for an act of the
    cogitative power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, if "to think" be understood broadly according to the first
    sense, then "to think with assent," does not express completely what is
    meant by "to believe": since, in this way, a man thinks with assent even
    when he considers what he knows by science [*Science is certain knowledge of
    a demonstrated conclusion through its demonstration.], or understands. If,
    on the other hand, "to think" be understood in the second way, then this
    expresses completely the nature of the act of believing. For among the acts
    belonging to the intellect, some have a firm assent without any such kind of
    thinking, as when a man considers the things that he knows by science, or
    understands, for this consideration is already formed. But some acts of the
    intellect have unformed thought devoid of a firm assent, whether they
    incline to neither side, as in one who "doubts"; or incline to one side
    rather than the other, but on account of some slight motive, as in one who
    "suspects"; or incline to one side yet with fear of the other, as in one who
    "opines." But this act "to believe," cleaves firmly to one side, in which
    respect belief has something in common with science and understanding; yet
    its knowledge does not attain the perfection of clear sight, wherein it
    agrees with doubt, suspicion and opinion. Hence it is proper to the believer
    to think with assent: so that the act of believing is distinguished from all
    the other acts of the intellect, which are about the true or the false.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Faith has not that research of natural
    reason which demonstrates what is believed, but a research into those things
    whereby a man is induced to believe, for instance that such things have been
    uttered by God and confirmed by miracles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> "To think" is not taken here for the act
    of the cogitative power, but for an act of the intellect, as explained
    above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The intellect of the believer is
    determined to one object, not by the reason, but by the will, wherefore
    assent is taken here for an act of the intellect as determined to one object
    by the will.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the act of faith is suitably distinguished as believing God,
    believing in a God and believing in God?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the act of faith is unsuitably
    distinguished as believing God, believing in a God, and believing in God.
    For one habit has but one act. Now faith is one habit since it is one
    virtue. Therefore it is unreasonable to say that there are three acts of
    faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which is common to all acts of
    faith should not be reckoned as a particular kind of act of faith. Now "to
    believe God" is common to all acts of faith, since faith is founded on the
    First Truth. Therefore it seems unreasonable to distinguish it from certain
    other acts of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which can be said of unbelievers,
    cannot be called an act of faith. Now unbelievers can be said to believe in
    a God. Therefore it should not be reckoned an act of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, movement towards the end belongs to the
    will, whose object is the good and the end. Now to believe is an act, not of
    the will, but of the intellect. Therefore "to believe in God," which implies
    movement towards an end, should not be reckoned as a species of that act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the contrary is the authority of Augustine who makes this distinction (De
    Verb. Dom., Serm. lxi---Tract. xxix in Joan.).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The act of any power or habit depends on the
    relation of that power or habit to its object. Now the object of faith can
    be considered in three ways. For, since "to believe" is an act of the
    intellect, in so far as the will moves it to assent, as stated above (<a
      href="SS002.html#SSQ2A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 3), the object of faith can be considered either on the part of the
    intellect, or on the part of the will that moves the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If it be considered on the part of the intellect, then two things can be
    observed in the object of faith, as stated above (<a
      href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). One of these is the
    material object of faith, and in this way an act of faith is "to believe in
    a God"; because, as stated above (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) nothing is proposed to
    our belief, except in as much as it is referred to God. The other is the
    formal aspect of the object, for it is the medium on account of which we
    assent to such and such a point of faith; and thus an act of faith is "to
    believe God," since, as stated above (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) the formal object of
    faith is the First Truth, to Which man gives his adhesion, so as to assent
    to Its sake to whatever he believes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, if the object of faith be considered in so far as the intellect is
    moved by the will, an act of faith is "to believe in God." For the First
    Truth is referred to the will, through having the aspect of an end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These three do not denote different acts
    of faith, but one and the same act having different relations to the object
    of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Unbelievers cannot be said "to believe
    in a God" as we understand it in relation to the act of faith. For they do
    not believe that God exists under the conditions that faith determines;
    hence they do not truly imply believe in a God, since, as the Philosopher
    observes (Metaph. ix, text. 22) "to know simple things defectively is not to
    know them at all."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) the will moves the
    intellect and the other powers of the soul to the end: and in this respect
    an act of faith is "to believe in God."<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether it is necessary for salvation to believe anything above the natural
    reason?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unnecessary for salvation to
    believe anything above the natural reason. For the salvation and perfection
    of a thing seem to be sufficiently insured by its natural endowments. Now
    matters of faith, surpass man's natural reason, since they are things unseen
    as stated above (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore to believe
    seems unnecessary for salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is dangerous for man to assent to
    matters, wherein he cannot judge whether that which is proposed to him be
    true or false, according to Job 12:11: "Doth not the ear discern words?" Now
    a man cannot form a judgment of this kind in matters of faith, since he
    cannot trace them back to first principles, by which all our judgments are
    guided. Therefore it is dangerous to believe in such matters. Therefore to
    believe is not necessary for salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man's salvation rests on God, according
    to Ps. 36:39: "But the salvation of the just is from the Lord." Now "the
    invisible things" of God "are clearly seen, being understood by the things
    that are made; His eternal power also and Divinity," according to Rm. 1:20:
    and those things which are clearly seen by the understanding are not an
    object of belief. Therefore it is not necessary for man's salvation, that he
    should believe certain things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A6"
      >Heb. 11:6</a
    >): "Without faith it is impossible to please God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Wherever one nature is subordinate to another,
    we find that two things concur towards the perfection of the lower nature,
    one of which is in respect of that nature's proper movement, while the other
    is in respect of the movement of the higher nature. Thus water by its proper
    movement moves towards the centre (of the earth), while according to the
    movement of the moon, it moves round the centre by ebb and flow. In like
    manner the planets have their proper movements from west to east, while in
    accordance with the movement of the first heaven, they have a movement from
    east to west. Now the created rational nature alone is immediately
    subordinate to God, since other creatures do not attain to the universal,
    but only to something particular, while they partake of the Divine goodness
    either in "being" only, as inanimate things, or also in "living," and in
    "knowing singulars," as plants and animals; whereas the rational nature, in
    as much as it apprehends the universal notion of good and being, is
    immediately related to the universal principle of being.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Consequently the perfection of the rational creature consists not only in
    what belongs to it in respect of its nature, but also in that which it
    acquires through a supernatural participation of Divine goodness. Hence it
    was said above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS003.html#FSQ3A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>) that man's ultimate
    happiness consists in a supernatural vision of God: to which vision man
    cannot attain unless he be taught by God, according to Jn. 6:45: "Every one
    that hath heard of the Father and hath learned cometh to Me." Now man
    acquires a share of this learning, not indeed all at once, but by little and
    little, according to the mode of his nature: and every one who learns thus
    must needs believe, in order that he may acquire science in a perfect
    degree; thus also the Philosopher remarks (De Soph. Elench. i, 2) that "it
    behooves a learner to believe."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence in order that a man arrive at the perfect vision of heavenly
    happiness, he must first of all believe God, as a disciple believes the
    master who is teaching him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since man's nature is dependent on a
    higher nature, natural knowledge does not suffice for its perfection, and
    some supernatural knowledge is necessary, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as man assents to first principles,
    by the natural light of his intellect, so does a virtuous man, by the habit
    of virtue, judge aright of things concerning that virtue; and in this way,
    by the light of faith which God bestows on him, a man assents to matters of
    faith and not to those which are against faith. Consequently "there is no"
    danger or "condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus," and whom He has
    enlightened by faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In many respects faith perceives the
    invisible things of God in a higher way than natural reason does in
    proceeding to God from His creatures. Hence it is written (Ecclus. 3:25):
    "Many things are shown to thee above the understandings of man."<br />

    Whether it is necessary to believe those things which can be proved by
    natural reason?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unnecessary to believe those things
    which can be proved by natural reason. For nothing is superfluous in God's
    works, much less even than in the works of nature. Now it is superfluous to
    employ other means, where one already suffices. Therefore it would be
    superfluous to receive by faith, things that can be known by natural
    reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those things must be believed, which are
    the object of faith. Now science and faith are not about the same object, as
    stated above (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5). Since therefore all
    things that can be known by natural reason are an object of science, it
    seems that there is no need to believe what can be proved by natural
    reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, all things knowable scientifically
    [*Science is certain knowledge of a demonstrated conclusion through its
    demonstration] would seem to come under one head: so that if some of them
    are proposed to man as objects of faith, in like manner the others should
    also be believed. But this is not true. Therefore it is not necessary to
    believe those things which can be proved by natural reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is necessary to believe that God is one
    and incorporeal: which things philosophers prove by natural reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is necessary for man to accept by faith not
    only things which are above reason, but also those which can be known by
    reason: and this for three motives. First, in order that man may arrive more
    quickly at the knowledge of Divine truth. Because the science to whose
    province it belongs to prove the existence of God, is the last of all to
    offer itself to human research, since it presupposes many other sciences: so
    that it would not by until late in life that man would arrive at the
    knowledge of God. The second reason is, in order that the knowledge of God
    may be more general. For many are unable to make progress in the study of
    science, either through dullness of mind, or through having a number of
    occupations, and temporal needs, or even through laziness in learning, all
    of whom would be altogether deprived of
  </p>
  <p>
    the knowledge of God, unless Divine things were brought to their knowledge
    under the guise of faith. The third reason is for the sake of certitude. For
    human reason is very deficient in things concerning God. A sign of this is
    that philosophers in their researches, by natural investigation, into human
    affairs, have fallen into many errors, and have disagreed among themselves.
    And consequently, in order that men might have knowledge of God, free of
    doubt and uncertainty, it was necessary for Divine matters to be delivered
    to them by way of faith, being told to them, as it were, by God Himself Who
    cannot lie.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The researches of natural reason do not
    suffice mankind for the knowledge of Divine matters, even of those that can
    be proved by reason: and so it is not superfluous if these others be
    believed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Science and faith cannot be in the same
    subject and about the same object: but what is an object of science for one,
    can be an object of faith for another, as stated above (<a

      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although all things that can be known by
    science are of one common scientific aspect, they do not all alike lead man
    to beatitude: hence they are not all equally proposed to our belief.<br />

    Whether man is bound to believe anything explicitly?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man is not bound to believe
    anything explicitly. For no man is bound to do what is not in his power. Now
    it is not in man's power to believe a thing explicitly, for it is written
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++10%3A14,15"
      >Rm. 10:14,15</a
    >): "How shall they believe Him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall
    they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach unless they be
    sent?" Therefore man is not bound to believe anything explicitly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as we are directed to God by faith,
    so are we by charity. Now man is not bound to keep the precepts of charity,
    and it is enough if he be ready to fulfil them: as is evidenced by the
    precept of Our Lord (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++5%3A39"
      >Mt. 5:39</a
    >): "If one strike thee on one [Vulg.: 'thy right'] cheek, turn to him also
    the other"; and by others of the same kind, according to Augustine's
    exposition (De Serm. Dom. in Monte xix). Therefore neither is man bound to
    believe anything explicitly, and it is enough if he be ready to believe
    whatever God proposes to be believed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the good of faith consists in obedience,
    according to Rm. 1:5: "For obedience to the faith in all nations." Now the
    virtue of obedience does not require man to keep certain fixed precepts, but
    it is enough that his mind be ready to obey, according to Ps. 118:60: "I am
    ready and am not troubled; that I may keep Thy commandments." Therefore it
    seems enough for faith, too, that man should be ready to believe whatever
    God may propose, without his believing anything explicitly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A6"
      >Heb. 11:6</a
    >): "He that cometh to God, must believe that He is, and is a rewarder to
    them that seek Him."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The precepts of the Law, which man is bound to
    fulfil, concern acts of virtue which are the means of attaining salvation.
    Now an act of virtue, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>) depends on the
    relation of the habit to its object. Again two things may be considered in
    the object of any virtue; namely, that which is the proper and direct object
    of that virtue, and that which is accidental and consequent to the object
    properly so called. Thus it belongs properly and directly to the object of
    fortitude, to face the dangers of death, and to charge at the foe with
    danger to oneself, for the sake of the common good: yet that, in a just war,
    a man be armed, or strike another with his sword, and so forth, is reduced
    to the object of fortitude, but indirectly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, just as a virtuous act is required for the fulfilment of a
    precept, so is it necessary that the virtuous act should terminate in its
    proper and direct object: but, on the other hand, the fulfilment of the
    precept does not require that a virtuous act should terminate in those
    things which have an accidental or secondary relation to the proper and
    direct object of that virtue, except in certain places and at certain times.
    We must, therefore, say that the direct object of faith is that whereby man
    is made one of the Blessed, as stated above (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>): while the indirect and
    secondary object comprises all things delivered by God to us in Holy Writ,
    for instance that Abraham had two sons, that David was the son of Jesse, and
    so forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, as regards the primary points or articles of faith, man is bound
    to believe them, just as he is bound to have faith; but as to other points
    of faith, man is not bound to believe them explicitly, but only implicitly,
    or to be ready to believe them, in so far as he is prepared to believe
    whatever is contained in the Divine Scriptures. Then alone is he bound to
    believe such things explicitly, when it is clear to him that they are
    contained in the doctrine of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> If we understand those things alone to
    be in a man's power, which we can do without the help of grace, then we are
    bound to do many things which we cannot do without the aid of healing grace,
    such as to love God and our neighbor, and likewise to believe the articles
    of faith. But with the help of grace we can do this, for this help "to
    whomsoever it is given from above it is mercifully given; and from whom it
    is withheld it is justly withheld, as a punishment of a previous, or at
    least of original, sin," as Augustine states (De Corr. et Grat. v, vi [*Cf.
    Ep. cxc; De Praed. Sanct. viii.]).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man is bound to love definitely those
    lovable things which are properly and directly the objects of charity,
    namely, God and our neighbor. The objection refers to those precepts of
    charity which belong, as a consequence, to the objects of charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The virtue of obedience is seated,
    properly speaking, in the will; hence promptness of the will subject to
    authority, suffices for the act of obedience, because it is the proper and
    direct object of obedience. But this or that precept is accidental or
    consequent to that proper and direct object.<br />

    Whether all are equally bound to have explicit faith?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all are equally bound to have
    explicit faith. For all are bound to those things which are necessary for
    salvation, as is evidenced by the precepts of charity. Now it is necessary
    for salvation that certain things should be believed explicitly. Therefore
    all are equally bound to have explicit faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one should be put to test in matters
    that he is not bound to believe. But simple reasons are sometimes tested in
    reference to the slightest articles of faith. Therefore all are bound to
    believe everything explicitly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the simple are bound to have, not
    explicit but only implicit faith, their faith must needs be implied in the
    faith of the learned. But this seems unsafe, since it is possible for the
    learned to err. Therefore it seems that the simple should also have explicit
    faith; so that all are, therefore, equally bound to have explicit faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+1%3A14"
      >Job 1:14</a
    >): "The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them," because,
    as Gregory expounds this passage (Moral. ii, 17), the simple, who are
    signified by the asses, ought, in matters of faith, to stay by the learned,
    who are denoted by the oxen.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The unfolding of matters of faith is the result
    of Divine revelation: for matters of faith surpass natural reason. Now
    Divine revelation reaches those of lower degree through those who are over
    them, in a certain order; to men, for instance, through the angels, and to
    the lower angels through the higher, as Dionysius explains (Coel. Hier. iv,
    vii). In like manner therefore the unfolding of faith must needs reach men
    of lower degree through those of higher degree. Consequently, just as the
    higher angels, who enlighten those who are below them, have a fuller
    knowledge of Divine things than the lower angels, as Dionysius states (Coel.
    Hier. xii), so too, men of higher degree, whose business it is to teach
    others, are under obligation to have fuller knowledge of matters of faith,
    and to believe them more explicitly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The unfolding of the articles of faith
    is not equally necessary for the salvation of all, since those of higher
    degree, whose duty it is to teach others, are bound to believe explicitly
    more things than others are.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Simple persons should not be put to the
    test about subtle questions of faith, unless they be suspected of having
    been corrupted by heretics, who are wont to corrupt the faith of simple
    people in such questions. If, however, it is found that they are free from
    obstinacy in their heterodox sentiments, and that it is due to their
    simplicity, it is no fault of theirs.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The simple have no faith implied in that
    of the learned, except in so far as the latter adhere to the Divine
    teaching. Hence the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++4%3A16"
      >1 Cor. 4:16</a
    >): "Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ." Hence it is not human
    knowledge, but the Divine truth that is the rule of faith: and if any of the
    learned stray from this rule, he does not harm the faith of the simple ones,
    who think that the learned believe aright; unless the simple hold
    obstinately to their individual errors, against the faith of the universal
    Church, which cannot err, since Our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++22%3A32"
      >Lk. 22:32</a

    Whether it is necessary for the salvation of all, that they should believe

  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not necessary for the
    salvation of all that they should believe explicitly in the mystery of
    Christ. For man is not bound to believe explicitly what the angels are
    ignorant about: since the unfolding of faith is the result of Divine
    revelation, which reaches man by means of the angels, as stated above (<a
      href="SS002.html#SSQ2A6THEP1"
      >Article [6]</a
    >; <a href="../FP.html">FP</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP111.html#FPQ111OUTP1">Question [111]</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP111.html#FPQ111A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now even the
    angels were in ignorance of the mystery of the Incarnation: hence, according
    to the commentary of Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii), it is they who ask (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++23%3A8"
      >Ps. 23:8</a
    >): "Who is this king of glory?" and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++63%3A1"
      >Is. 63:1</a
    >): "Who is this that cometh from Edom?" Therefore men were not bound to
    believe explicitly in the mystery of Christ's Incarnation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is evident that John the Baptist was
    one of the teachers, and most nigh to Christ, Who said of him (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++11%3A11"
      >Mt. 11:11</a
    >) that "there hath not risen among them that are born of women, a greater
    than" he. Now John the Baptist does not appear to have known the mystery of
    Christ explicitly, since he asked Christ (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++11%3A3"
      >Mt. 11:3</a
    >): "Art Thou He that art to come, or look we for another?" Therefore even
    the teachers were not bound to explicit faith in Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, many gentiles obtained salvation through
    the ministry of the angels, as Dionysius states (Coel. Hier. ix). Now it
    would seem that the gentiles had neither explicit nor implicit faith in
    Christ, since they received no revelation. Therefore it seems that it was
    not necessary for the salvation of all to believe explicitly in the mystery
    of Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Corr. et Gratia vii; Ep.
    cxc): "Our faith is sound if we believe that no man, old or young is
    delivered from the contagion of death and the bonds of sin, except by the
    one Mediator of God and men, Jesus Christ."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS002.html#SSQ2A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >; <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>), the object of faith
    includes, properly and directly, that thing through which man obtains
    beatitude. Now the mystery of Christ's Incarnation and Passion is the way by
    which men obtain beatitude; for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+4%3A12"
      >Acts 4:12</a
    >): "There is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be
    saved." Therefore belief of some kind in the mystery of Christ's Incarnation
    was necessary at all times and for all persons, but this belief differed
    according to differences of times and persons. The reason of this is that
    before the state of sin, man believed, explicitly in Christ's Incarnation,
    in so far as it was intended for the consummation of glory, but not as it
    was intended to deliver man from sin by the Passion and Resurrection, since
    man had no foreknowledge of his future sin. He does, however, seem to have
    had foreknowledge of the Incarnation of Christ, from the fact that he said
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++2%3A24">Gn. 2:24</a>):
    "Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his
    wife," of which the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A32"
      >Eph. 5:32</a
    >) that "this is a great sacrament... in Christ and the Church," and it is
    incredible that the first man was ignorant about this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But after sin, man believed explicitly in Christ, not only as to the
    Incarnation, but also as to the Passion and Resurrection, whereby the human
    race is delivered from sin and death: for they would not, else, have
    foreshadowed Christ's Passion by certain sacrifices both before and after
    the Law, the meaning of which sacrifices was known by the learned
    explicitly, while the simple folk, under the veil of those sacrifices,
    believed them to be ordained by God in reference to Christ's coming, and
    thus their knowledge was covered with a veil, so to speak. And, as stated
    above (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), the nearer they were to
    Christ, the more distinct was their knowledge of Christ's mysteries.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    After grace had been revealed, both learned and simple folk are bound to
    explicit faith in the mysteries of Christ, chiefly as regards those which
    are observed throughout the Church, and publicly proclaimed, such as the
    articles which refer to the Incarnation, of which we have spoken above (<a
      href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). As to other minute
    points in reference to the articles of the Incarnation, men have been bound
    to believe them more or less explicitly according to each one's state and
    office.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The mystery of the Kingdom of God was
    not entirely hidden from the angels, as Augustine observes (Gen. ad lit. v,
    19), yet certain aspects thereof were better known to them when Christ
    revealed them to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It was not through ignorance that John
    the Baptist inquired of Christ's advent in the flesh, since he had clearly
    professed his belief therein, saying: "I saw, and I gave testimony, that
    this is the Son of God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A34"
      >Jn. 1:34</a
    >). Hence he did not say: "Art Thou He that hast come?" but "Art Thou He
    that art to come?" thus saying about the future, not about the past.
    Likewise it is not to be believed that he was ignorant of Christ's future
    Passion, for he had already said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A39"
      >Jn. 1:39</a
    >): "Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who taketh away the sins [Vulg.:
    'sin'] of the world," thus foretelling His future immolation; and since
    other prophets had foretold it, as may be seen especially in Isaias 53. We
    may therefore say with Gregory (Hom. xxvi in Evang.) that he asked this
    question, being in ignorance as to whether Christ would descend into hell in
    His own Person. But he did not ignore the fact that the power of Christ's
    Passion would be extended to those who were detained in Limbo, according to
    Zach. 9:11: "Thou also, by the blood of Thy testament hast sent forth Thy
    prisoners out of the pit, wherein there is no water"; nor was he bound to
    believe explicitly, before its fulfilment, that Christ was to descend
    thither Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It may also be replied that, as Ambrose observes in his commentary on Lk.
    7:19, he made this inquiry, not from doubt or ignorance but from devotion:
    or again, with Chrysostom (Hom. xxxvi in Matth.), that he inquired, not as
    though ignorant himself, but because he wished his disciples to be satisfied
    on that point, through Christ: hence the latter framed His answer so as to
    instruct the disciples, by pointing to the signs of His works.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Many of the gentiles received
    revelations of Christ, as is clear from their predictions. Thus we read (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+19%3A25"
      >Job 19:25</a
    >): "I know that my Redeemer liveth." The Sibyl too foretold certain things
    about Christ, as Augustine states (Contra Faust. xiii, 15). Moreover, we
    read in the history of the Romans, that at the time of Constantine Augustus
    and his mother Irene a tomb was discovered, wherein lay a man on whose
    breast was a golden plate with the inscription: "Christ shall be born of a
    virgin, and in Him, I believe. O sun, during the lifetime of Irene and
    Constantine, thou shalt see me again" [*Cf. Baron, Annal., A.D. 780]. If,
    however, some were saved without receiving any revelation, they were not
    saved without faith in a Mediator, for, though they did not believe in Him
    explicitly, they did, nevertheless, have implicit faith through believing in
    Divine providence, since they believed that God would deliver mankind in
    whatever way was pleasing to Him, and according to the revelation of the
    Spirit to those who knew the truth, as stated in Job 35:11: "Who teacheth us
    more than the beasts of the earth."<br />

    Whether it is necessary for salvation to believe explicitly in the
    Trinity?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not necessary for
    salvation to believe explicitly in the Trinity. For the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A6"
      >Heb. 11:6</a
    >): "He that cometh to God must believe that He is, and is a rewarder to
    them that seek Him." Now one can believe this without believing in the
    Trinity. Therefore it was not necessary to believe explicitly in the
    Trinity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++17%3A5,6"
      >Jn. 17:5,6</a
    >): "Father, I have manifested Thy name to men," which words Augustine
    expounds (Tract. cvi) as follows: "Not the name by which Thou art called
    God, but the name whereby Thou art called My Father," and further on he
    adds: "In that He made this world, God is known to all nations; in that He
    is not to be worshipped together with false gods, 'God is known in Judea';
    but, in that He is the Father of this Christ, through Whom He takes away the
    sin of the world, He now makes known to men this name of His, which hitherto
    they knew not." Therefore before the coming of Christ it was not known that
    Paternity and Filiation were in the Godhead: and so the Trinity was not
    believed explicitly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which we are bound to believe
    explicitly of God is the object of heavenly happiness. Now the object of
    heavenly happiness is the sovereign good, which can be understood to be in
    God, without any distinction of Persons. Therefore it was not necessary to
    believe explicitly in the Trinity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> In the Old Testament the Trinity of Persons
    is expressed in many ways; thus at the very outset of Genesis it is written
    in manifestation of the Trinity: "Let us make man to Our image and likeness"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A26">Gn. 1:26</a>).
    Therefore from the very beginning it was necessary for salvation to believe
    in the Trinity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible to believe explicitly in the
    mystery of Christ, without faith in the Trinity, since the mystery of Christ
    includes that the Son of God took flesh; that He renewed the world through
    the grace of the Holy Ghost; and again, that He was conceived by the Holy
    Ghost. Wherefore just as, before Christ, the mystery of Christ was believed
    explicitly by the learned, but implicitly and under a veil, so to speak, by
    the simple, so too was it with the mystery of the Trinity. And consequently,
    when once grace had been revealed, all were bound to explicit faith in the
    mystery of the Trinity: and all who are born again in Christ, have this
    bestowed on them by the invocation of the Trinity, according to Mt. 28:19:
    "Going therefore teach ye all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
    Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Explicit faith in those two things was
    necessary at all times and for all people: but it was not sufficient at all
    times and for all people.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Before Christ's coming, faith in the
    Trinity lay hidden in the faith of the learned, but through Christ and the
    apostles it was shown to the world.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God's sovereign goodness as we
    understand it now through its effects, can be understood without the Trinity
    of Persons: but as understood in itself, and as seen by the Blessed, it
    cannot be understood without the Trinity of Persons. Moreover the mission of
    the Divine Persons brings us to heavenly happiness.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether to believe is meritorious?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that to believe in not meritorious.
    For the principle of all merit is charity, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114OUTP1">Question [114]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now faith, like
    nature, is a preamble to charity. Therefore, just as an act of nature is not
    meritorious, since we do not merit by our natural gifts, so neither is an
    act of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, belief is a mean between opinion and
    scientific knowledge or the consideration of things scientifically known
    [*Science is a certain knowledge of a demonstrated conclusion through its
    demonstration.]. Now the considerations of science are not meritorious, nor
    on the other hand is opinion. Therefore belief is not meritorious.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, he who assents to a point of faith,
    either has a sufficient motive for believing, or he has not. If he has a
    sufficient motive for his belief, this does not seem to imply any merit on
    his part, since he is no longer free to believe or not to believe: whereas
    if he has not a sufficient motive for believing, this is a mark of levity,
    according to Ecclus. 19:4: "He that is hasty to give credit, is light of
    heart," so that, seemingly, he gains no merit thereby. Therefore to believe
    is by no means meritorious.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A33"
      >Heb. 11:33</a
    >) that the saints "by faith... obtained promises," which would not be the
    case if they did not merit by believing. Therefore to believe is
    meritorious.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114OUTP1">Question [114]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), our actions are
    meritorious in so far as they proceed from the free-will moved with grace by
    God. Therefore every human act proceeding from the free-will, if it be
    referred to God, can be meritorious. Now the act of believing is an act of
    the intellect assenting to the Divine truth at the command of the will moved
    by the grace of God, so that it is subject to the free-will in relation to
    God; and consequently the act of faith can be meritorious.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Nature is compared to charity which is
    the principle of merit, as matter to form: whereas faith is compared to
    charity as the disposition which precedes the ultimate form. Now it is
    evident that the subject or the matter cannot act save by virtue of the
    form, nor can a preceding disposition, before the advent of the form: but
    after the advent of the form, both the subject and the preceding disposition
    act by virtue of the form, which is the chief principle of action, even as
    the heat of fire acts by virtue of the substantial form of fire. Accordingly
    neither nature nor faith can, without charity, produce a meritorious act;
    but, when accompanied by charity, the act of faith is made meritorious
    thereby, even as an act of nature, and a natural act of the free-will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Two things may be considered in science:
    namely the scientist's assent to a scientific fact and his consideration of
    that fact. Now the assent of science is not subject to free-will, because
    the scientist is obliged to assent by force of the demonstration, wherefore
    scientific assent is not meritorious. But the actual consideration of what a
    man knows scientifically is subject to his free-will, for it is in his power
    to consider or not to consider. Hence scientific consideration may be
    meritorious if it be referred to the end of charity, i.e. to the honor of
    God or the good of our neighbor. On the other hand, in the case of faith,
    both these things are subject to the free-will so that in both respects the
    act of faith can be meritorious: whereas in the case of opinion, there is no
    firm assent, since it is weak and infirm, as the Philosopher observes
    (Poster. i, 33), so that it does not seem to proceed from a perfect act of
    the will: and for this reason, as regards the assent, it does not appear to
    be very meritorious, though it can be as regards the actual
    consideration.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The believer has sufficient motive for
    believing, for he is moved by the authority of Divine teaching confirmed by
    miracles, and, what is more, by the inward instinct of the Divine
    invitation: hence he does not believe lightly. He has not, however,
    sufficient reason for scientific knowledge, hence he does not lose the
    merit.<br />

    Whether reasons in support of what we believe lessen the merit of faith?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that reasons in support of what we
    believe lessen the merit of faith. For Gregory says (Hom. xxvi in Evang.)
    that "there is no merit in believing what is shown by reason." If,
    therefore, human reason provides sufficient proof, the merit of faith is
    altogether taken away. Therefore it seems that any kind of human reasoning
    in support of matters of faith, diminishes the merit of believing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever lessens the measure of virtue,
    lessens the amount of merit, since "happiness is the reward of virtue," as
    the Philosopher states (Ethic. i, 9). Now human reasoning seems to diminish
    the measure of the virtue of faith, since it is essential to faith to be
    about the unseen, as stated above (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5). Now the more a thing
    is supported by reasons the less is it unseen. Therefore human reasons in
    support of matters of faith diminish the merit of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, contrary things have contrary causes.
    Now an inducement in opposition to faith increases the merit of faith
    whether it consist in persecution inflicted by one who endeavors to force a
    man to renounce his faith, or in an argument persuading him to do so.
    Therefore reasons in support of faith diminish the merit of faith.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Pt++3%3A15"
      >1 Pt. 3:15</a
    >): "Being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of
    that faith [*Vulg.: 'Of that hope which is in you.' St. Thomas' reading is
    apparently taken from Bede.] and hope which is in you." Now the Apostle
    would not give this advice, if it would imply a diminution in the merit of
    faith. Therefore reason does not diminish the merit of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS002.html#SSQ2A9THEP1"
      >Article [9]</a
    >), the act of faith can be meritorious, in so far as it is subject to the
    will, not only as to the use, but also as to the assent. Now human reason in
    support of what we believe, may stand in a twofold relation to the will of
    the believer. First, as preceding the act of the will; as, for instance,
    when a man either has not the will, or not a prompt will, to believe, unless
    he be moved by human reasons: and in this way human reason diminishes the
    merit of faith. In this sense it has been said above (<a href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1;
    <a href="SS077.html#SSQ77OUTP1">Question [77]</a>,
    <a href="SS077.html#SSQ77A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 2) that, in moral
    virtues, a passion which precedes choice makes the virtuous act less
    praiseworthy. For just as a man ought to perform acts of moral virtue, on
    account of the judgment of his reason, and not on account of a passion, so
    ought he to believe matters of faith, not on account of human reason, but on
    account of the Divine authority. Secondly, human reasons may be consequent
    to the will of the believer. For when a man's will is ready to believe, he
    loves the truth he believes, he thinks out and takes to heart whatever
    reasons he can find in support thereof; and in this way human reason does
    not exclude the merit of faith but is a sign of greater merit. Thus again,
    in moral virtues a consequent passion is the sign of a more prompt will, as
    stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1). We have an
    indication of this in the words of the Samaritans to the woman, who is a
    type of human reason: "We now believe, not for thy saying" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++4%3A42"
      >Jn. 4:42</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gregory is referring to the case of a
    man who has no will to believe what is of faith, unless he be induced by
    reasons. But when a man has the will to believe what is of faith on the
    authority of God alone, although he may have reasons in demonstration of
    some of them, e.g. of the existence of God, the merit of his faith is not,
    for that reason, lost or diminished.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The reasons which are brought forward in
    support of the authority of faith, are not demonstrations which can bring
    intellectual vision to the human intellect, wherefore they do not cease to
    be unseen. But they remove obstacles to faith, by showing that what faith
    proposes is not impossible; wherefore such reasons do not diminish the merit
    or the measure of faith. On the other hand, though demonstrative reasons in
    support of the preambles of faith [*The Leonine Edition reads: 'in support
    of matters of faith which are however, preambles to the articles of faith,
    diminish,' etc.], but not of the articles of faith, diminish the measure of
    faith, since they make the thing believed to be seen, yet they do not
    diminish the measure of charity, which makes the will ready to believe them,
    even if they were unseen; and so the measure of merit is not diminished.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Whatever is in opposition to faith,
    whether it consist in a man's thoughts, or in outward persecution, increases
    the merit of faith, in so far as the will is shown to be more prompt and
    firm in believing. Hence the martyrs had more merit of faith, through not
    renouncing faith on account of persecution; and even the wise have greater
    merit of faith, through not renouncing their faith on account of the reasons
    brought forward by philosophers or heretics in opposition to faith. On the
    other hand things that are favorable to faith, do not always diminish the
    promptness of the will to believe, and therefore they do not always diminish
    the merit of faith.<br />
