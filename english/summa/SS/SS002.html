</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that to believe is not to think with assent. 
Because the Latin word "cogitatio" [thought] implies a research, for 
"cogitare" [to think] seems to be equivalent to "coagitare," i.e. "to 
discuss together." Now Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv) that faith is 
"an assent without research." Therefore thinking has no place in the act 
of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, faith resides in the reason, as we shall show further on 
(<A Href="SS004.html#SSQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="SS004.html#SSQ4A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now to think is an act of the cogitative power, which 
belongs to the sensitive faculty, as stated in the FP,  Question [78], Article [4]. 
Therefore thought has nothing to do with faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to believe is an act of the intellect, since its object 
is truth. But assent seems to be an act not of the intellect, but of the 
will, even as consent is, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS015.html#FSQ15OUTP1">Question [15]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS015.html#FSQ15A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3). 
Therefore to believe is not to think with assent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> This is how "to believe" is defined by Augustine (De 
Praedest. Sanct. ii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> "To think" can be taken in three ways. First, in a 
general way for any kind of actual consideration of the intellect, as 
Augustine observes (De Trin. xiv, 7): "By understanding I mean now the 
faculty whereby we understand when thinking." Secondly, "to think" is 
more strictly taken for that consideration of the intellect, which is 
accompanied by some kind of inquiry, and which precedes the intellect's 
arrival at the stage of perfection that comes with the certitude of 
sight. In this sense Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 16) that "the Son of 
God is not called the Thought, but the Word of God. When our thought 
realizes what we know and takes form therefrom, it becomes our word. 
Hence the Word of God must be understood without any thinking on the part 
of God, for there is nothing there that can take form, or be unformed." 
In this way thought is, properly speaking, the movement of the mind while 
yet deliberating, and not yet perfected by the clear sight of truth. 
Since, however, such a movement of the mind may be one of deliberation 
either about universal notions, which belongs to the intellectual 
faculty, or about particular matters, which belongs to the sensitive 
part, hence it is that "to think" is taken secondly for an act of the 
deliberating intellect, and thirdly for an act of the cogitative power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, if "to think" be understood broadly according to the first 
sense, then "to think with assent," does not express completely what is 
meant by "to believe": since, in this way, a man thinks with assent even 
when he considers what he knows by science [*Science is certain knowledge 
of a demonstrated conclusion through its demonstration.], or understands. 
If, on the other hand, "to think" be understood in the second way, then 
this expresses completely the nature of the act of believing. For among 
the acts belonging to the intellect, some have a firm assent without any 
such kind of thinking, as when a man considers the things that he knows 
by science, or understands, for this consideration is already formed. But 
some acts of the intellect have unformed thought devoid of a firm assent, 
whether they incline to neither side, as in one who "doubts"; or incline 
to one side rather than the other, but on account of some slight motive, 
as in one who "suspects"; or incline to one side yet with fear of the 
other, as in one who "opines." But this act "to believe," cleaves firmly 
to one side, in which respect belief has something in common with science 
and understanding; yet its knowledge does not attain the perfection of 
clear sight, wherein it agrees with doubt, suspicion and opinion. Hence 
it is proper to the believer to think with assent: so that the act of  
believing is distinguished from all the other acts of the intellect, 
which are about the true or the false.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Faith has not that research of natural reason which 
demonstrates what is believed, but a research into those things whereby a 
man is induced to believe, for instance that such things have been 
uttered by God and confirmed by miracles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> "To think" is not taken here for the act of the cogitative 
power, but for an act of the intellect, as explained above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The intellect of the believer is determined to one object, 
not by the reason, but by the will, wherefore assent is taken here for an 
act of the intellect as determined to one object by the will.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the act of faith is suitably distinguished as believing God, believing in a God and believing in God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the act of faith is unsuitably distinguished 
as believing God, believing in a God, and believing in God. For one habit 
has but one act. Now faith is one habit since it is one virtue. Therefore 
it is unreasonable to say that there are three acts of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which is common to all acts of faith should not be 
reckoned as a particular kind of act of faith. Now "to believe God" is 
common to all acts of faith, since faith is founded on the First Truth. 
Therefore it seems unreasonable to distinguish it from certain other acts 
of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which can be said of unbelievers, cannot be called 
an act of faith. Now unbelievers can be said to believe in a God. 
Therefore it should not be reckoned an act of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, movement towards the end belongs to the will, whose 
object is the good and the end. Now to believe is an act, not of the 
will, but of the intellect. Therefore "to believe in God," which implies 
movement towards an end, should not be reckoned as a species of that act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the contrary is the authority of Augustine who makes this distinction 
(De Verb. Dom., Serm. lxi---Tract. xxix in Joan.).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The act of any power or habit depends on the relation of 
that power or habit to its object. Now the object of faith can be 
considered in three ways. For, since "to believe" is an act of the 
intellect, in so far as the will moves it to assent, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS002.html#SSQ2A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3), the object of faith can be considered either on the part of 
the intellect, or on the part of the will that moves the intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[2] Body Para. 2/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If it be considered on the part of the intellect, then two things can be 
observed in the object of faith, as stated above (<A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). One of 
these is the material object of faith, and in this way an act of faith is 
"to believe in a God"; because, as stated above (<A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) nothing is 
proposed to our belief, except in as much as it is referred to God. The 
other is the formal aspect of the object, for it is the medium on account 
of which we assent to such and such a point of faith; and thus an act of 
faith is "to believe God," since, as stated above (<A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) the formal 
object of faith is the First Truth, to Which man gives his adhesion, so 
as to assent to Its sake to whatever he believes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, if the object of faith be considered in so far as the intellect 
is moved by the will, an act of faith is "to believe in God." For the 
First Truth is referred to the will, through having the aspect of an end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These three do not denote different acts of faith, but one 
and the same act having different relations to the object of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Unbelievers cannot be said "to believe in a God" as we 
understand it in relation to the act of faith. For they do not believe 
that God exists under the conditions that faith determines; hence they do 
not truly imply believe in a God, since, as the Philosopher observes 
(Metaph. ix, text. 22) "to know simple things defectively is not to know 
them at all."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) the will moves the 
intellect and the other powers of the soul to the end: and in this 
respect an act of faith is "to believe in God."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is necessary for salvation to believe anything above the natural reason?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unnecessary for salvation to believe anything above 
the natural reason. For the salvation and perfection of a thing seem to 
be sufficiently insured by its natural endowments. Now matters of faith, 
surpass man's natural reason, since they are things unseen as stated 
above (<A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore to believe seems unnecessary for salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is dangerous for man to assent to matters, wherein he 
cannot judge whether that which is proposed to him be true or false, 
according to Job 12:11: "Doth not the ear discern words?" Now a man 
cannot form a judgment of this kind in matters of faith, since he cannot 
trace them back to first principles, by which all our judgments are 
guided. Therefore it is dangerous to believe in such matters. Therefore 
to believe is not necessary for salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man's salvation rests on God, according to Ps. 36:39: 
"But the salvation of the just is from the Lord." Now "the invisible 
things" of God "are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are 
made; His eternal power also and Divinity," according to Rm. 1:20: and 
those things which are clearly seen by the understanding are not an 
object of belief. Therefore it is not necessary for man's salvation, that 
he should believe certain things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++11:6">Heb. 11:6</a>): "Without faith it is 
impossible to please God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Wherever one nature is subordinate to another, we find 
that two things concur towards the perfection of the lower nature, one of 
which is in respect of that nature's proper movement, while the other is 
in respect of the movement of the higher nature. Thus water by its proper 
movement moves towards the centre (of the earth), while according to the 
movement of the moon, it moves round the centre by ebb and flow. In like 
manner the planets have their proper movements from west to east, while 
in accordance with the movement of the first heaven, they have a movement 
from east to west. Now the created rational nature alone is immediately 
subordinate to God, since other creatures do not attain to the universal, 
but only to something particular, while they partake of the Divine 
goodness either in "being" only, as inanimate things, or also in 
"living," and in "knowing singulars," as plants and animals; whereas the 
rational nature, in as much as it apprehends the universal notion of good 
and being, is immediately related to the universal principle of being.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently the perfection of the rational creature consists not only 
in what belongs to it in respect of its nature, but also in that which it 
acquires through a supernatural participation of Divine goodness. Hence 
it was said above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS003.html#FSQ3A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>) that man's ultimate happiness consists 
in a supernatural vision of God: to which vision man cannot attain unless 
he be taught by God, according to Jn. 6:45: "Every one that hath heard of 
the Father and hath learned cometh to Me." Now man acquires a share of 
this learning, not indeed all at once, but by little and little, 
according to the mode of his nature: and every one who learns thus must 
needs believe, in order that he may acquire science in a perfect degree; 
thus also the Philosopher remarks (De Soph. Elench. i, 2) that "it 
behooves a learner to believe."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence in order that a man arrive at the perfect vision of heavenly 
happiness, he must first of all believe God, as a disciple believes the 
master who is teaching him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since man's nature is dependent on a higher nature, natural 
knowledge does not suffice for its perfection, and some supernatural 
knowledge is necessary, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as man assents to first principles, by the natural 
light of his intellect, so does a virtuous man, by the  habit of virtue, 
judge aright of things concerning that virtue; and in this way, by the 
light of faith which God bestows on him, a man assents to matters of 
faith and not to those which are against faith. Consequently "there is 
no" danger or "condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus," and whom 
He has enlightened by faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In many respects faith perceives the invisible things of 
God in a higher way than natural reason does in proceeding to God from 
His creatures. Hence it is written (Ecclus. 3:25): "Many things are shown 
to thee above the understandings of man."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is necessary to believe those things which can be proved by natural reason?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unnecessary to believe those things which can be 
proved by natural reason. For nothing is superfluous in God's works, much 
less even than in the works of nature. Now it is superfluous to employ 
other means, where one already suffices. Therefore it would be 
superfluous to receive by faith, things that can be known by natural 
reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those things must be believed, which are the object of 
faith. Now science and faith are not about the same object, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5). Since therefore all things that can be known by 
natural reason are an object of science, it seems that there is no need 
to believe what can be proved by natural reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, all things knowable scientifically [*Science is certain 
knowledge of a demonstrated conclusion through its demonstration] would 
seem to come under one head: so that if some of them are proposed to man 
as objects of faith, in like manner the others should also be believed. 
But this is not true. Therefore it is not necessary to believe those 
things which can be proved by natural reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is necessary to believe that God is one and 
incorporeal: which things philosophers prove by natural reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is necessary for man to accept by faith not only 
things which are above reason, but also those which can be known by 
reason: and this for three motives. First, in order that man may arrive 
more quickly at the knowledge of Divine truth. Because the science to 
whose province it belongs to prove the existence of God, is the last of 
all to offer itself to human research, since it presupposes many other 
sciences: so that it would not by until late in life that man would 
arrive at the knowledge of God. The second reason is, in order that the 
knowledge of God may be more general. For many are unable to make 
progress in the study of science, either through dullness of mind, or 
through having a number of occupations, and temporal needs, or even 
through laziness in learning, all of whom would be altogether deprived of 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; the knowledge of God, unless Divine things were brought to their 
knowledge under the guise of faith. The third reason is for the sake of 
certitude. For human reason is very deficient in things concerning God. A 
sign of this is that philosophers in their researches, by natural 
investigation, into human affairs, have fallen into many errors, and have 
disagreed among themselves. And consequently, in order that men might 
have knowledge of God, free of doubt and uncertainty, it was necessary 
for Divine matters to be delivered to them by way of faith, being told to 
them, as it were, by God Himself Who cannot lie.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The researches of natural reason do not suffice mankind for 
the knowledge of Divine matters, even of those that can be proved by 
reason: and so it is not superfluous if these others be believed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Science and faith cannot be in the same subject and about 
the same object: but what is an object of science for one, can be an 
object of faith for another, as stated above (<A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although all things that can be known by science are of one 
common scientific aspect, they do not all alike lead man to beatitude: 
hence they are not all equally proposed to our belief.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether man is bound to believe anything explicitly?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man is not bound to believe anything 
explicitly. For no man is bound to do what is not in his power. Now it is 
not in man's power to believe a thing explicitly, for it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++10:14,15">Rm. 10:14,15</a>): "How shall they believe Him, of whom they have not heard? And 
how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach unless 
they be sent?" Therefore man is not bound to believe anything explicitly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as we are directed to God by faith, so are we by 
charity. Now man is not bound to keep the precepts of charity, and it is 
enough if he be ready to fulfil them: as is evidenced by the precept of 
Our Lord (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++5:39">Mt. 5:39</a>): "If one strike thee on one [Vulg.: 'thy right'] 
cheek, turn to him also the other"; and by others of the same kind, 
according to Augustine's exposition (De Serm. Dom. in Monte xix). 
Therefore neither is man bound to believe anything explicitly, and it is 
enough if he be ready to believe whatever God proposes to be believed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the good of faith consists in obedience, according to 
Rm. 1:5: "For obedience to the faith in all nations." Now the virtue of 
obedience does not require man to keep certain fixed precepts, but it is 
enough that his mind be ready to obey, according to Ps. 118:60: "I am 
ready and am not troubled; that I may keep Thy commandments." Therefore 
it seems enough for faith, too, that man should be ready to believe 
whatever God may propose,  without his believing anything explicitly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++11:6">Heb. 11:6</a>): "He that cometh to God, must 
believe that He is, and is a rewarder to them that seek Him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[5] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The precepts of the Law, which man is bound to fulfil, 
concern acts of virtue which are the means of attaining salvation. Now an 
act of virtue, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>) depends on the relation 
of the habit to its object. Again two things may be considered in the 
object of any virtue; namely, that which is the proper and direct object 
of that virtue, and that which is accidental and consequent to the object 
properly so called. Thus it belongs properly and directly to the object 
of fortitude, to face the dangers of death, and to charge at the foe with 
danger to oneself, for the sake of the common good: yet that, in a just 
war, a man be armed, or strike another with his sword, and so forth, is 
reduced to the object of fortitude, but indirectly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[5] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, just as a virtuous act is required for the fulfilment of a 
precept, so is it necessary that the virtuous act should terminate in its 
proper and direct object: but, on the other hand, the fulfilment of the 
precept does not require that a virtuous act should terminate in those 
things which have an accidental or secondary relation to the proper and 
direct object of that virtue, except in certain places and at certain 
times. We must, therefore, say that the direct object of faith is that 
whereby man is made one of the Blessed, as stated above (<A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>): 
while the indirect and secondary object comprises all things delivered by 
God to us in Holy Writ, for instance that Abraham had two sons, that 
David was the son of Jesse, and so forth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[5] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, as regards the primary points or articles of faith, man is 
bound to believe them, just as he is bound to have faith; but as to other 
points of faith, man is not bound to believe them explicitly, but only 
implicitly, or to be ready to believe them, in so far as he is prepared 
to believe whatever is contained in the Divine Scriptures. Then alone is 
he bound to believe such things explicitly, when it is clear to him that 
they are contained in the doctrine of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> If we understand those things alone to be in a man's power, 
which we can do without the help of grace, then we are bound to do many 
things which we cannot do without the aid of healing grace, such as to 
love God and our neighbor, and likewise to believe the articles of faith. 
But with the help of grace we can do this, for this help "to whomsoever 
it is given from above it is mercifully given; and from whom it is 
withheld it is justly withheld, as a punishment of a previous, or at 
least of original, sin," as Augustine states (De Corr. et Grat. v, vi 
[*Cf. Ep. cxc; De Praed. Sanct. viii.]).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man is bound to love definitely those lovable  things which 
are properly and directly the objects of charity, namely, God and our 
neighbor. The objection refers to those precepts of charity which belong, 
as a consequence, to the objects of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The virtue of obedience is seated, properly speaking, in 
the will; hence promptness of the will subject to authority, suffices for 
the act of obedience, because it is the proper and direct object of 
obedience. But this or that precept is accidental or consequent to that 
proper and direct object.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all are equally bound to have explicit faith. 
For all are bound to those things which are necessary for salvation, as 
is evidenced by the precepts of charity. Now it is necessary for 
salvation that certain things should be believed explicitly. Therefore 
all are equally bound to have explicit faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one should be put to test in matters that he is not 
bound to believe. But simple reasons are sometimes tested in reference to 
the slightest articles of faith. Therefore all are bound to believe 
everything explicitly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if the simple are bound to have, not explicit but only 
implicit faith, their faith must needs be implied in the faith of the 
learned. But this seems unsafe, since it is possible for the learned to 
err. Therefore it seems that the simple should also have explicit faith; 
so that all are, therefore, equally bound to have explicit faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Job+1:14">Job 1:14</a>): "The oxen were ploughing, and 
the asses feeding beside them," because, as Gregory expounds this passage 
(Moral. ii, 17), the simple, who are signified by the asses, ought, in 
matters of faith, to stay by the learned, who are denoted by the oxen.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The unfolding of matters of faith is the result of Divine 
revelation: for matters of faith surpass natural reason. Now Divine 
revelation reaches those of lower degree through those who are over them, 
in a certain order; to men, for instance, through the angels, and to the 
lower angels through the higher, as Dionysius explains (Coel. Hier. iv, 
vii). In like manner therefore the unfolding of faith must needs reach 
men of lower degree through those of higher degree. Consequently, just as 
the higher angels, who enlighten those who are below them, have a fuller 
knowledge of Divine things than the lower angels, as Dionysius states 
(Coel. Hier. xii), so too, men of higher degree, whose business it is to 
teach others, are under obligation to have fuller knowledge of matters of 
faith, and to believe them more explicitly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The unfolding of the articles of faith is not  equally 
necessary for the salvation of all, since those of higher degree, whose 
duty it is to teach others, are bound to believe explicitly more things 
than others are.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Simple persons should not be put to the test about subtle 
questions of faith, unless they be suspected of having been corrupted by 
heretics, who are wont to corrupt the faith of simple people in such 
questions. If, however, it is found that they are free from obstinacy in 
their heterodox sentiments, and that it is due to their simplicity, it is 
no fault of theirs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The simple have no faith implied in that of the learned, 
except in so far as the latter adhere to the Divine teaching. Hence the 
Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++4:16">1 Cor. 4:16</a>): "Be ye followers of me, as I also am of 
Christ." Hence it is not human knowledge, but the Divine truth that is 
the rule of faith: and if any of the learned stray from this rule, he 
does not harm the faith of the simple ones, who think that the learned 
believe aright; unless the simple hold obstinately to their individual 
errors, against the faith of the universal Church, which cannot err, 
since Our Lord said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++22:32">Lk. 22:32</a>): "I have prayed for thee," Peter, "that 
thy faith fail not."<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not necessary for the salvation of all 
that they should believe explicitly in the mystery of Christ. For man is 
not bound to believe explicitly what the angels are ignorant about: since 
the unfolding of faith is the result of Divine revelation, which reaches 
man by means of the angels, as stated above (<A Href="SS002.html#SSQ2A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>; <A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP111.html#FPQ111OUTP1">Question [111]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP111.html#FPQ111A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now 
even the angels were in ignorance of the mystery of the Incarnation: 
hence, according to the commentary of Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii), it is 
they who ask (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++23:8">Ps. 23:8</a>): "Who is this king of glory?" and (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++63:1">Is. 63:1</a>): 
"Who is this that cometh from Edom?" Therefore men were not bound to 
believe explicitly in the mystery of Christ's Incarnation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is evident that John the Baptist was one of the 
teachers, and most nigh to Christ, Who said of him (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++11:11">Mt. 11:11</a>) that 
"there hath not risen among them that are born of women, a greater than" 
he. Now John the Baptist does not appear to have known the mystery of 
Christ explicitly, since he asked Christ (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++11:3">Mt. 11:3</a>): "Art Thou He that 
art to come, or look we for another?" Therefore even the teachers were 
not bound to explicit faith in Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, many gentiles obtained salvation through the ministry of 
the angels, as Dionysius states (Coel. Hier. ix). Now it would seem that 
the gentiles had neither explicit nor implicit faith in Christ, since 
they received no revelation. Therefore it seems that it was not necessary 
for the salvation of all to believe explicitly in the mystery of Christ. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Corr. et Gratia vii; Ep. cxc): "Our 
faith is sound if we believe that no man, old or young is delivered from 
the contagion of death and the bonds of sin, except by the one Mediator 
of God and men, Jesus Christ."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[7] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS002.html#SSQ2A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>), the object of faith 
includes, properly and directly, that thing through which man obtains 
beatitude. Now the mystery of Christ's Incarnation and Passion is the way 
by which men obtain beatitude; for it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Acts+4:12">Acts 4:12</a>): "There is 
no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be saved." 
Therefore belief of some kind in the mystery of Christ's Incarnation was 
necessary at all times and for all persons, but this belief differed 
according to differences of times and persons. The reason of this is that 
before the state of sin, man believed, explicitly in Christ's 
Incarnation, in so far as it was intended for the consummation of glory, 
but not as it was intended to deliver man from sin by the Passion and 
Resurrection, since man had no foreknowledge of his future sin. He does, 
however, seem to have had foreknowledge of the Incarnation of Christ, 
from the fact that he said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++2:24">Gn. 2:24</a>): "Wherefore a man shall leave 
father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife," of which the Apostle 
says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eph++5:32">Eph. 5:32</a>) that "this is a great sacrament . . . in Christ and the 
Church," and it is incredible that the first man was ignorant about this 
sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[7] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But after sin, man believed explicitly in Christ, not only as to the 
Incarnation, but also as to the Passion and Resurrection, whereby the 
human race is delivered from sin and death: for they would not, else, 
have foreshadowed Christ's Passion by certain sacrifices both before and 
after the Law, the meaning of which sacrifices was known by the learned 
explicitly, while the simple folk, under the veil of those sacrifices, 
believed them to be ordained by God in reference to Christ's coming, and 
thus their knowledge was covered with a veil, so to speak. And, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), the nearer they were to Christ, the more distinct was 
their knowledge of Christ's mysteries.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[7] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After grace had been revealed, both learned and simple folk are bound to 
explicit faith in the mysteries of Christ, chiefly as regards those which 
are observed throughout the Church, and publicly proclaimed, such as the 
articles which refer to the Incarnation, of which we have spoken above 
(<A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). As to other minute points in reference to the articles of 
the Incarnation, men have been bound to believe them more or less 
explicitly according to each one's state and office.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The mystery of the Kingdom of God was not entirely hidden 
from the angels, as Augustine observes (Gen. ad lit. v, 19), yet certain 
aspects thereof were better known to them when Christ revealed them to 
them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It was not through ignorance that John the Baptist inquired 
of Christ's advent in the flesh, since he had  clearly professed his 
belief therein, saying: "I saw, and I gave testimony, that this is the 
Son of God" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++1:34">Jn. 1:34</a>). Hence he did not say: "Art Thou He that hast 
come?" but "Art Thou He that art to come?" thus saying about the future, 
not about the past. Likewise it is not to be believed that he was 
ignorant of Christ's future Passion, for he had already said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++1:39">Jn. 1:39</a>): 
"Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who taketh away the sins [Vulg.: 
'sin'] of the world," thus foretelling His future immolation; and since 
other prophets had foretold it, as may be seen especially in Isaias 53. 
We may therefore say with Gregory (Hom. xxvi in Evang.) that he asked 
this question, being in ignorance as to whether Christ would descend into 
hell in His own Person. But he did not ignore the fact that the power of 
Christ's Passion would be extended to those who were detained in Limbo, 
according to Zach. 9:11: "Thou also, by the blood of Thy testament hast 
sent forth Thy prisoners out of the pit, wherein there is no water"; nor 
was he bound to believe explicitly, before its fulfilment, that Christ 
was to descend thither Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It may also be replied that, as Ambrose observes in his commentary on 
Lk. 7:19, he made this inquiry, not from doubt or ignorance but from 
devotion: or again, with Chrysostom (Hom. xxxvi in Matth.), that he 
inquired, not as though ignorant himself, but because he wished his 
disciples to be satisfied on that point, through Christ: hence the latter 
framed His answer so as to instruct the disciples, by pointing to the 
signs of His works.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Many of the gentiles received revelations of Christ, as is 
clear from their predictions. Thus we read (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Job+19:25">Job 19:25</a>): "I know that my 
Redeemer liveth." The Sibyl too foretold certain things about Christ, as 
Augustine states (Contra Faust. xiii, 15). Moreover, we read in the 
history of the Romans, that at the time of Constantine Augustus and his 
mother Irene a tomb was discovered, wherein lay a man on whose breast was 
a golden plate with the inscription: "Christ shall be born of a virgin, 
and in Him, I believe. O sun, during the lifetime of Irene and 
Constantine, thou shalt see me again" [*Cf. Baron, Annal., A.D. 780]. If, 
however, some were saved without receiving any revelation, they were not 
saved without faith in a Mediator, for, though they did not believe in 
Him explicitly, they did, nevertheless, have implicit faith through 
believing in Divine providence, since they believed that God would 
deliver mankind in whatever way was pleasing to Him, and according to the 
revelation of the Spirit to those who knew the truth, as stated in Job 
35:11: "Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth."<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not necessary for salvation to believe 
explicitly in the Trinity. For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++11:6">Heb. 11:6</a>): "He that 
cometh to God must believe that He is, and is a rewarder to them that 
seek Him." Now one can believe this without  believing in the Trinity. 
Therefore it was not necessary to believe explicitly in the Trinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further our Lord said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++17:5,6">Jn. 17:5,6</a>): "Father, I have manifested 
Thy name to men," which words Augustine expounds (Tract. cvi) as follows: 
"Not the name by which Thou art called God, but the name whereby Thou art 
called My Father," and further on he adds: "In that He made this world, 
God is known to all nations; in that He is not to be worshipped together 
with false gods, 'God is known in Judea'; but, in that He is the Father 
of this Christ, through Whom He takes away the sin of the world, He now 
makes known to men this name of His, which hitherto they knew not." 
Therefore before the coming of Christ it was not known that Paternity and 
Filiation were in the Godhead: and so the Trinity was not believed 
explicitly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which we are bound to believe explicitly of God is 
the object of heavenly happiness. Now the object of heavenly happiness is 
the sovereign good, which can be understood to be in God, without any 
distinction of Persons. Therefore it was not necessary to believe 
explicitly in the Trinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In the Old Testament the Trinity of Persons is 
expressed in many ways; thus at the very outset of Genesis it is written 
in manifestation of the Trinity: "Let us make man to Our image and 
likeness" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++1:26">Gn. 1:26</a>). Therefore from the very beginning it was necessary 
for salvation to believe in the Trinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is impossible to believe explicitly in the mystery of 
Christ, without faith in the Trinity, since the mystery of Christ 
includes that the Son of God took flesh; that He renewed the world 
through the grace of the Holy Ghost; and again, that He was conceived by 
the Holy Ghost. Wherefore just as, before Christ, the mystery of Christ 
was believed explicitly by the learned, but implicitly and under a veil, 
so to speak, by the simple, so too was it with the mystery of the 
Trinity. And consequently, when once grace had been revealed, all were 
bound to explicit faith in the mystery of the Trinity: and all who are 
born again in Christ, have this bestowed on them by the invocation of the 
Trinity, according to Mt. 28:19: "Going therefore teach ye all nations, 
baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy 
Ghost."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Explicit faith in those two things was necessary at all 
times and for all people: but it was not sufficient at all times and for 
all people.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Before Christ's coming, faith in the Trinity lay hidden in 
the faith of the learned, but through Christ and the apostles it was 
shown to the world.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God's sovereign goodness as we understand it now through 
its effects, can be understood without the Trinity of Persons: but as 
understood in itself, and as seen by the Blessed, it cannot be understood 
without the Trinity of Persons. Moreover  the mission of the Divine 
Persons brings us to heavenly happiness.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether to believe is meritorious?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that to believe in not meritorious. For the 
principle of all merit is charity, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114OUTP1">Question [114]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). 
Now faith, like nature, is a preamble to charity. Therefore, just as an 
act of nature is not meritorious, since we do not merit by our natural 
gifts, so neither is an act of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, belief is a mean between opinion and scientific 
knowledge or the consideration of things scientifically known [*Science 
is a certain knowledge of a demonstrated conclusion through its 
demonstration.]. Now the considerations of science are not meritorious, 
nor on the other hand is opinion. Therefore belief is not meritorious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, he who assents to a point of faith, either has a 
sufficient motive for believing, or he has not. If he has a sufficient 
motive for his belief, this does not seem to imply any merit on his part, 
since he is no longer free to believe or not to believe: whereas if he 
has not a sufficient motive for believing, this is a mark of levity, 
according to Ecclus. 19:4: "He that is hasty to give credit, is light of 
heart," so that, seemingly, he gains no merit thereby. Therefore to 
believe is by no means meritorious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++11:33">Heb. 11:33</a>) that the saints "by faith . 
. . obtained promises," which would not be the case if they did not merit 
by believing. Therefore to believe is meritorious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[9] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114OUTP1">Question [114]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), our actions are 
meritorious in so far as they proceed from the free-will moved with grace 
by God. Therefore every human act proceeding from the free-will, if it be 
referred to God, can be meritorious. Now the act of believing is an act 
of the intellect assenting to the Divine truth at the command of the will 
moved by the grace of God, so that it is subject to the free-will in 
relation to God; and consequently the act of faith can be meritorious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[9] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Nature is compared to charity which is the principle of 
merit, as matter to form: whereas faith is compared to charity as the 
disposition which precedes the ultimate form. Now it is evident that the 
subject or the matter cannot act save by virtue of the form, nor can a 
preceding disposition, before the advent of the form: but after the 
advent of the form, both the subject and the preceding disposition act by 
virtue of the form, which is the chief principle of action, even as the 
heat of fire acts by virtue of the substantial form of fire. Accordingly 
neither nature nor faith can, without charity, produce a meritorious act; 
but, when accompanied by charity, the act of faith is made meritorious 
thereby, even as an act of nature, and a natural act of the  free-will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Two things may be considered in science: namely the 
scientist's assent to a scientific fact and his consideration of that 
fact. Now the assent of science is not subject to free-will, because the 
scientist is obliged to assent by force of the demonstration, wherefore 
scientific assent is not meritorious. But the actual consideration of 
what a man knows scientifically is subject to his free-will, for it is in 
his power to consider or not to consider. Hence scientific consideration 
may be meritorious if it be referred to the end of charity, i.e. to the 
honor of God or the good of our neighbor. On the other hand, in the case 
of faith, both these things are subject to the free-will so that in both 
respects the act of faith can be meritorious: whereas in the case of 
opinion, there is no firm assent, since it is weak and infirm, as the 
Philosopher observes (Poster. i, 33), so that it does not seem to proceed 
from a perfect act of the will: and for this reason, as regards the 
assent, it does not appear to be very meritorious, though it can be as 
regards the actual consideration.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The believer has sufficient motive for believing, for he is 
moved by the authority of Divine teaching confirmed by miracles, and, 
what is more, by the inward instinct of the Divine invitation: hence he 
does not believe lightly. He has not, however, sufficient reason for 
scientific knowledge, hence he does not lose the merit.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether reasons in support of what we believe lessen the merit of faith?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that reasons in support of what we believe lessen 
the merit of faith. For Gregory says (Hom. xxvi in Evang.) that "there is 
no merit in believing what is shown by reason." If, therefore, human 
reason provides sufficient proof, the merit of faith is altogether taken 
away. Therefore it seems that any kind of human reasoning in support of 
matters of faith, diminishes the merit of believing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever lessens the measure of virtue, lessens the 
amount of merit, since "happiness is the reward of virtue," as the 
Philosopher states (Ethic. i, 9). Now human reasoning seems to diminish 
the measure of the virtue of faith, since it is essential to faith to be 
about the unseen, as stated above (<A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5). Now the more a thing 
is supported by reasons the less is it unseen. Therefore human reasons in 
support of matters of faith diminish the merit of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, contrary things have contrary causes. Now an inducement 
in opposition to faith increases the merit of faith whether it consist in 
persecution inflicted by one who endeavors to force a man to renounce his 
faith, or in an argument persuading him to do so. Therefore reasons in 
support of faith diminish the merit of faith. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Pt++3:15">1 Pt. 3:15</a>): "Being ready always to 
satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that faith [*Vulg.: 'Of 
that hope which is in you.' St. Thomas' reading is apparently taken from 
Bede.] and hope which is in you." Now the Apostle would not give this 
advice, if it would imply a diminution in the merit of faith. Therefore 
reason does not diminish the merit of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[10] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS002.html#SSQ2A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>), the act of faith can be 
meritorious, in so far as it is subject to the will, not only as to the 
use, but also as to the assent. Now human reason in support of what we 
believe, may stand in a twofold relation to the will of the believer. 
First, as preceding the act of the will; as, for instance, when a man 
either has not the will, or not a prompt will, to believe, unless he be 
moved by human reasons: and in this way human reason diminishes the merit 
of faith. In this sense it has been said above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="SS077.html#SSQ77OUTP1">Question [77]</a>, <A Href="SS077.html#SSQ77A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 2) that, in moral virtues, a passion which precedes 
choice makes the virtuous act less praiseworthy. For just as a man ought 
to perform acts of moral virtue, on account of the judgment of his 
reason, and not on account of a passion, so ought he to believe matters 
of faith, not on account of human reason, but on account of the Divine 
authority. Secondly, human reasons may be consequent to the will of the 
believer. For when a man's will is ready to believe, he loves the truth 
he believes, he thinks out and takes to heart whatever reasons he can 
find in support thereof; and in this way human reason does not exclude 
the merit of faith but is a sign of greater merit. Thus again, in moral 
virtues a consequent passion is the sign of a more prompt will, as stated 
above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1). We have an indication of this in the words 
of the Samaritans to the woman, who is a type of human reason: "We now 
believe, not for thy saying" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++4:42">Jn. 4:42</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gregory is referring to the case of a man who has no will 
to believe what is of faith, unless he be induced by reasons. But when a 
man has the will to believe what is of faith on the authority of God 
alone, although he may have reasons in demonstration of some of them, 
e.g. of the existence of God, the merit of his faith is not, for that 
reason, lost or diminished.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The reasons which are brought forward in support of the 
authority of faith, are not demonstrations which can bring intellectual 
vision to the human intellect, wherefore they do not cease to be unseen. 
But they remove obstacles to faith, by showing that what faith proposes 
is not impossible; wherefore such reasons do not diminish the merit or 
the measure of faith. On the other hand, though demonstrative reasons in 
support of the preambles of faith [*The Leonine Edition reads: 'in 
support of matters of faith which are however, preambles to the articles 
of faith, diminish,' etc.], but not of the articles of faith, diminish 
the measure of faith, since they make the thing believed to be seen, yet 
they do not diminish the measure of charity, which makes the will ready 
to believe them, even if they were unseen; and so the measure of merit  
is not diminished.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[2] A[10] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Whatever is in opposition to faith, whether it consist in a 
man's thoughts, or in outward persecution, increases the merit of faith, 
in so far as the will is shown to be more prompt and firm in believing. 
Hence the martyrs had more merit of faith, through not renouncing faith 
on account of persecution; and even the wise have greater merit of faith, 
through not renouncing their faith on account of the reasons brought 
forward by philosophers or heretics in opposition to faith. On the other 
hand things that are favorable to faith, do not always diminish the 
promptness of the will to believe, and therefore they do not always 
diminish the merit of faith.<br>
