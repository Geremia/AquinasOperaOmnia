    Whether the parts of temperance are rightly assigned?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii,
    54) unbecomingly assigns the parts of temperance, when he asserts them to be
    "continence, mildness, and modesty." For continence is reckoned to be
    distinct from virtue (Ethic. vii, 1): whereas temperance is comprised under
    virtue. Therefore continence is not a part of temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, mildness seemingly softens hatred or
    anger. But temperance is not about these things, but about pleasures of
    touch, as stated above (<a href="SS141.html#SSQ141OUTP1">Question [141]</a>,
    <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore mildness is
    not a part of temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, modesty concerns external action,
    wherefore the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Phil++4%3A5"
      >Phil. 4:5</a
    >): "Let your modesty be known to all men." Now external actions are the
    matter of justice, as stated above (<a href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1"
      >Question [58]</a
    >, <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Therefore modesty is
    a part of justice rather than of temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Macrobius (In Somn. Scip. i, 8) reckons
    many more parts of temperance: for he says that "temperance results in
    modesty, shamefacedness, abstinence, chastity, honesty, moderation,
    lowliness, sobriety, purity." Andronicus also says [*De Affectibus] that
    "the companions of temperance are gravity, continence, humility, simplicity,
    refinement, method, contentment." [*'Per-se-sufficientiam' which could be
    rendered 'self-sufficiency,' but for the fact that this is taken in a bad
    sense. See Question [169], Article [1].] Therefore it seems that Tully
    insufficiently reckoned the parts of temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1"
      >Questions [48]</a
    >,128), a cardinal virtue may have three kinds of parts, namely integral,
    subjective, and potential. The integral parts of a virtue are the conditions
    the concurrence of which are necessary for virtue: and in this respect there
    are two integral parts of temperance, "shamefacedness," whereby one recoils
    from the disgrace that is contrary to temperance, and "honesty," whereby one
    loves the beauty of temperance. For, as stated above (<a
      href="SS141.html#SSQ141OUTP1"
      >Question [141]</a
    >, <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3), temperance
    more than any other virtue lays claim to a certain comeliness, and the vices
    of intemperance excel others in disgrace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The subjective parts of a virtue are its species: and the species of a
    virtue have to be differentiated according to the difference of matter or
    object. Now temperance is about pleasures of touch, which are of two kinds.
    For some are directed to nourishment: and in these as regards meat, there is
    "abstinence," and as regards drink properly there is "sobriety." Other
    pleasures are directed to the power of procreation, and in these as regards
    the principal pleasure of the act itself of procreation, there is
    "chastity," and as to the pleasures incidental to the act, resulting, for
    instance, from kissing, touching, or fondling, we have "purity."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The potential parts of a principal virtue are called secondary virtues: for
    while the principal virtue observes the mode in some principal matter, these
    observe the mode in some other matter wherein moderation is not so
    difficult. Now it belongs to temperance to moderate pleasures of touch,
    which are most difficult to moderate. Wherefore any virtue that is effective
    of moderation in some matter or other, and restrains the appetite in its
    impulse towards something, may be reckoned a part of temperance, as a virtue
    annexed thereto.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This happens in three ways: first, in the inward movements of the soul;
    secondly, in the outward movements and actions of the body; thirdly, in
    outward things. Now besides the movement of concupiscence, which temperance
    moderates and restrains, we find in the soul three movements towards a
    particular object. In the first place there is the movement of the will when
    stirred by the impulse of passion: and this movement is restrained by
    "continence," the effect of which is that, although a man suffer immoderate
    concupiscences, his will does not succumb to them. Another inward movement
    towards something is the movement of hope, and of the resultant daring, and
    this is moderated or restrained by "humility." The third movement is that of
    anger, which tends towards revenge, and this is restrained by "meekness" or
    "mildness."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    With regard to bodily movements and actions, moderation and restraint is the
    effect of "modesty," which, according to Andronicus, has three parts. The
    first of these enables one to discern what to do and what not to do, and to
    observe the right order, and to persevere in what we do: this he assigns to
    "method." The second is that a man observe decorum in what he does, and this
    he ascribes to "refinement." The third has to do with the conversation or
    any other intercourse between a man and his friends, and this is called
    "gravity."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    With regard to external things, a twofold moderation has to be observed.
    First, we must not desire too many, and to this Macrobius assigns
    "lowliness," and Andronicus "contentment"; secondly, we must not be too nice
    in our requirements, and to this Macrobius ascribes "moderation," Andronicus
    "simplicity."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is true that continence differs from
    virtue, just as imperfect differs from perfect, as we shall state further on
    (<a href="SS165.html#SSQ165OUTP1">Question [165]</a>,
    <a href="SS165.html#SSQ165A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>); and in this sense it is
    condivided with virtue. Yet it has something in common with temperance both
    as to matter, since it is about pleasures of touch, and as to mode, since it
    is a kind of restraint. Hence it is suitably assigned as a part of
    temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Mildness or meekness is reckoned a part
    of temperance not because of a likeness of matter, but because they agree as
    to the mode of restraint and moderation as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the matter of external action justice
    considers what is due to another. Modesty does not consider this, but only a
    certain moderation. Hence it is reckoned a part not of justice but of
    temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Under modesty Tully includes whatever
    pertains to the moderation of bodily movements and external things, as well
    as the moderation of hope which we reckoned as pertaining to humility.<br />
