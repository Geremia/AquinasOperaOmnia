</h3>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) unbecomingly 
assigns the parts of temperance, when he asserts them to be "continence, 
mildness, and modesty." For continence is reckoned to be distinct from 
virtue (Ethic. vii, 1): whereas temperance is comprised under virtue. 
Therefore continence is not a part of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, mildness seemingly softens hatred or anger. But 
temperance is not about these things, but about pleasures of touch, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141OUTP1">Question [141]</a>, <A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore mildness is not a part of 
temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, modesty concerns external action, wherefore the Apostle 
says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++4%3A5">Phil. 4:5</a>): "Let your modesty be known to all men." Now external 
actions are the matter of justice, as stated above (<A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). 
Therefore modesty is a part of justice rather than of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Macrobius (In Somn. Scip. i, 8) reckons many more parts 
of temperance: for he says that "temperance results in  modesty, 
shamefacedness, abstinence, chastity, honesty, moderation, lowliness, 
sobriety, purity." Andronicus also says [*De Affectibus] that "the 
companions of temperance are gravity, continence, humility, simplicity, 
refinement, method, contentment." [*'Per-se-sufficientiam' which could be 
rendered 'self-sufficiency,' but for the fact that this is taken in a bad 
sense. See Question [169], Article [1].] Therefore it seems that Tully insufficiently 
reckoned the parts of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] Body Para. 1/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [48]</a>,128), a cardinal virtue may have 
three kinds of parts, namely integral, subjective, and potential. The 
integral parts of a virtue are the conditions the concurrence of which 
are necessary for virtue: and in this respect there are two integral 
parts of temperance, "shamefacedness," whereby one recoils from the 
disgrace that is contrary to temperance, and "honesty," whereby one loves 
the beauty of temperance. For, as stated above (<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141OUTP1">Question [141]</a>, <A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3), 
temperance more than any other virtue lays claim to a certain comeliness, 
and the vices of intemperance excel others in disgrace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] Body Para. 2/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The subjective parts of a virtue are its species: and the species of a 
virtue have to be differentiated according to the difference of matter or 
object. Now temperance is about pleasures of touch, which are of two 
kinds. For some are directed to nourishment: and in these as regards 
meat, there is "abstinence," and as regards drink properly there is 
"sobriety." Other pleasures are directed to the power of procreation, and 
in these as regards the principal pleasure of the act itself of 
procreation, there is "chastity," and as to the pleasures incidental to 
the act, resulting, for instance, from kissing, touching, or fondling, we 
have "purity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] Body Para. 3/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The potential parts of a principal virtue are called secondary virtues: 
for while the principal virtue observes the mode in some principal 
matter, these observe the mode in some other matter wherein moderation is 
not so difficult. Now it belongs to temperance to moderate pleasures of 
touch, which are most difficult to moderate. Wherefore any virtue that is 
effective of moderation in some matter or other, and restrains the 
appetite in its impulse towards something, may be reckoned a part of 
temperance, as a virtue annexed thereto.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] Body Para. 4/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This happens in three ways: first, in the inward movements of the soul; 
secondly, in the outward movements and actions of the body; thirdly, in 
outward things. Now besides the movement of concupiscence, which 
temperance moderates and restrains, we find in the soul three movements 
towards a particular object. In the first place there is the movement of 
the will when stirred by the impulse of passion: and this movement is 
restrained by "continence," the effect of which is that, although a man 
suffer immoderate concupiscences, his will does not succumb to them. 
Another inward movement towards something is the movement of hope, and of 
the resultant daring, and this is moderated or restrained by "humility." 
The third movement is that of anger, which tends  towards revenge, and 
this is restrained by "meekness" or "mildness."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] Body Para. 5/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to bodily movements and actions, moderation and restraint is 
the effect of "modesty," which, according to Andronicus, has three parts. 
The first of these enables one to discern what to do and what not to do, 
and to observe the right order, and to persevere in what we do: this he 
assigns to "method." The second is that a man observe decorum in what he 
does, and this he ascribes to "refinement." The third has to do with the 
conversation or any other intercourse between a man and his friends, and 
this is called "gravity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] Body Para. 6/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to external things, a twofold moderation has to be observed. 
First, we must not desire too many, and to this Macrobius assigns 
"lowliness," and Andronicus "contentment"; secondly, we must not be too 
nice in our requirements, and to this Macrobius ascribes "moderation," 
Andronicus "simplicity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is true that continence differs from virtue, just as 
imperfect differs from perfect, as we shall state further on (<A Href="SS165.html#SSQ165OUTP1">Question [165]</a>, <A Href="SS165.html#SSQ165A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>); and in this sense it is condivided with virtue. Yet it has 
something in common with temperance both as to matter, since it is about 
pleasures of touch, and as to mode, since it is a kind of restraint. 
Hence it is suitably assigned as a part of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Mildness or meekness is reckoned a part of temperance not 
because of a likeness of matter, but because they agree as to the mode of 
restraint and moderation as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the matter of external action justice considers what is 
due to another. Modesty does not consider this, but only a certain 
moderation. Hence it is reckoned a part not of justice but of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[143] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Under modesty Tully includes whatever pertains to the 
moderation of bodily movements and external things, as well as the 
moderation of hope which we reckoned as pertaining to humility.<br>
