    OF OBSERVANCE, CONSIDERED IN ITSELF, AND OF ITS PARTS (THREE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider observance and its parts, the considerations of which
    will manifest the contrary vices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the head of observance there are three points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS102.html#SSQ102A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether observance is a special
    virtue, distinct from other virtues?
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS102.html#SSQ102A2THEP1">(2)</a> What does observance offer?</p>
  <p>

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether observance is a special virtue, distinct from other virtues?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that observance is not a special virtue,
    distinct from other virtues. For virtues are distinguished by their objects.
    But the object of observance is not distinct from the object of piety: for
    Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "it is by observance that we pay
    worship and honor to those who excel in some kind of dignity." But worship
    and honor are paid also by piety to our parents, who excel in dignity.
    Therefore observance is not a distinct virtue from piety.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as honor and worship are due to
    those that are in a position of dignity, so also are they due to those who
    excel in science and virtue. But there is no special virtue whereby we pay
    honor and worship to those who excel in science and virtue. Therefore
    observance, whereby we pay worship and honor to those who excel in dignity,
    is not a special virtue distinct from other virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we have many duties towards those who
    are in a position of dignity, the fulfilment of which is required by law,
    according to Rm. 13:7, "Render... to all men their dues: tribute to whom
    tribute is due," etc. Now the fulfilment of the requirements of the law
    belongs to legal justice, or even to special justice. Therefore observance
    is not by itself a special virtue distinct from other virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) reckons
    observance along with the other parts of justice, which are special
    virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As explained above (<a
      href="SS101.html#SSQ101OUTP1"
      >Question [101]</a
    >, <a href="SS101.html#SSQ101ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3;
    <a href="SS080.html#SSQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>), according to the various
    excellences of those persons to whom something is due, there must needs be a
    corresponding distinction of virtues in a descending order. Now just as a
    carnal father partakes of the character of principle in a particular way,
    which character is found in God in a universal way, so too a person who, in
    some way, exercises providence in one respect, partakes of the character of
    father in a particular way, since a father is the principle of generation,
    of education, of learning and of whatever pertains to the perfection of
    human life: while a person who is in a position of dignity is as a principle
    of government with regard to certain things: for instance, the governor of a
    state in civil matters, the commander of an army in matters of warfare, a
    professor in matters of learning, and so forth. Hence it is that all such
    persons are designated as "fathers," on account of their being charged with
    like cares: thus the servants of Naaman said to him (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Kgs++5%3A13"
      >4 Kgs. 5:13</a
    >): "Father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing," etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, just as, in a manner, religion, whereby worship is given to find
    piety, whereby we worship our so under piety we find observance, whereby
    worship and honor are paid to persons in positions of dignity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS101.html#SSQ101OUTP1"
      >Question [101]</a
    >, <a href="SS101.html#SSQ101A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2), religion goes
    by the name of piety by way of supereminence, although piety properly so
    called is distinct from religion; and in the same way piety can be called
    observance by way of excellence, although observance properly speaking is
    distinct from piety.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By the very fact of being in a position
    of dignity a man not only excels as regards his position, but also has a
    certain power of governing subjects, wherefore it is fitting that he should
    be considered as a principle inasmuch as he is the governor of others. On
    the other hand, the fact that a man has perfection of science and virtue
    does not give him the character of a principle in relation to others, but
    merely a certain excellence in himself. Wherefore a special virtue is
    appointed for the payment of worship and honor to persons in positions of
    dignity. Yet, forasmuch as science, virtue and all like things render a man
    fit for positions of dignity, the respect which is paid to anyone on account
    of any excellence whatever belongs to the same virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It belongs to special justice, properly
    speaking, to pay the equivalent to those to whom we owe anything. Now this
    cannot be done to the virtuous, and to those who make good use of their
    position of dignity, as neither can it be done to God, nor to our parents.
    Consequently these matters belong to an annexed virtue, and not to special
    justice, which is a principal virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Legal justice extends to the acts of all the virtues, as stated above (<a

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether it belongs to observance to pay worship and honor to those who are
    in positions of dignity?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it does not belong to observance to
    pay worship and honor to persons in positions of dignity. For according to
    Augustine (De Civ. Dei x), we are said to worship those persons whom we hold
    in honor, so that worship and honor would seem to be the same. Therefore it
    is unfitting to define observance as paying worship and honor to persons in
    positions of dignity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to justice that we pay what
    we owe: wherefore this belongs to observance also, since it is a part of
    justice. Now we do not owe worship and honor to all persons in positions of
    dignity, but only to those who are placed over us. Therefore observance is
    unfittingly defined as giving worship and honor to all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, not only do we owe honor to persons of
    dignity who are placed over us; we owe them also fear and a certain payment
    of remuneration, according to Rm. 13:7, "Render... to all men their dues;
    tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear;
    honor to whom honor." Moreover, we owe them reverence and subjection,
    according to Heb. 13:17, "Obey your prelates, and be subject to them."
    Therefore observance is not fittingly defined as paying worship and
    honor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "it is
    by observance that we pay worship and honor to those who excel in some kind
    of dignity."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It belongs to persons in positions of dignity
    to govern subjects. Now to govern is to move certain ones to their due end:
    thus a sailor governs his ship by steering it to port. But every mover has a
    certain excellence and power over that which is moved. Wherefore, a person
    in a position of dignity is an object of twofold consideration: first, in so
    far as he obtains excellence of position, together with a certain power over
    subjects: secondly, as regards the exercise of his government. In respect of
    his excellence there is due to him honor, which is the recognition of some
    kind of excellence; and in respect of the exercise of his government, there
    is due to him worship, consisting in rendering him service, by obeying his
    commands, and by repaying him, according to one's faculty, for the benefits
    we received from him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Worship includes not only honor, but
    also whatever other suitable actions are connected with the relations
    between man and man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS080.html#SSQ80OUTP1"
      >Question [80]</a
    >), debt is twofold. One is legal debt, to pay which man is compelled by
    law; and thus man owes honor and worship to those persons in positions of
    dignity who are placed over him. The other is moral debt, which is due by
    reason of a certain honesty: it is in this way that we owe worship and honor
    to persons in positions of dignity even though we be not their subjects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Honor is due to the excellence of
    persons in positions of dignity, on account of their higher rank: while fear
    is due to them on account of their power to use compulsion: and to the
    exercise of their government there is due both obedience, whereby subjects
    are moved at the command of their superiors, and tributes, which are a
    repayment of their labor.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether observance is a greater virtue than piety?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that observance is a greater virtue than
    piety. For the prince to whom worship is paid by observance is compared to a
    father who is worshiped by piety, as a universal to a particular governor;
    because the household which a father governs is part of the state which is
    governed by the prince. Now a universal power is greater, and inferiors are
    more subject thereto. Therefore observance is a greater virtue than
    piety.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, persons in positions of dignity take
    care of the common good. Now our kindred pertain to the private good, which
    we ought to set aside for the common good: wherefore it is praiseworthy to
    expose oneself to the danger of death for the sake of the common good.
    Therefore observance, whereby worship is paid to persons in positions of
    dignity, is a greater virtue than piety, which pays worship to one's
    kindred.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further honor and reverence are due to the
    virtuous in the first place after God. Now honor and reverence are paid to
    the virtuous by the virtue of observance, as stated above (<a
      href="SS102.html#SSQ102A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 3). Therefore observance takes the first place after religion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The precepts of the Law prescribe acts of
    virtue. Now, immediately after the precepts of religion, which belong to the
    first table, follows the precept of honoring our parents which refers to
    piety. Therefore piety follows immediately after religion in the order of
    excellence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Something may be paid to persons in positions
    of dignity in two ways. First, in relation to the common good, as when one
    serves them in the administration of the affairs of the state. This no
    longer belongs to observance, but to piety, which pays worship not only to
    one's father but also to one's fatherland. Secondly, that which is paid to
    persons in positions of dignity refers specially to their personal
    usefulness or renown, and this belongs properly to observance, as distinct
    from piety. Therefore in comparing observance with piety we must needs take
    into consideration the different relations in which other persons stand to
    ourselves, which relations both virtues regard. Now it is evident that the
    persons of our parents and of our kindred are more substantially akin to us
    than persons in positions of dignity, since birth and education, which
    originate in the father, belong more to one's substance than external
    government, the principle of which is seated in those who are in positions
    of dignity. For this reason piety takes precedence of observance, inasmuch
    as it pays worship to persons more akin to us, and to whom we are more
    strictly bound.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The prince is compared to the father as
    a universal to a particular power, as regards external government, but not
    as regards the father being a principle of generation: for in this way the
    father should be compared with the divine power from which all things derive
    their being.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In so far as persons in positions of
    dignity are related to the common good, their worship does not pertain to
    observance, but to piety, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The rendering of honor or worship should
    be proportionate to the person to whom it is paid not only as considered in
    himself, but also as compared to those who pay them. Wherefore, though
    virtuous persons, considered in themselves, are more worthy of honor than
    the persons of one's parents, yet children are under a greater obligation,
    on account of the benefits they have received from their parents and their
    natural kinship with them, to pay worship and honor to their parents than to
    virtuous persons who are not of their kindred.<br />
