<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider observance and its parts, the considerations of 
which will manifest the contrary vices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the head of observance there are three points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS102.html#SSQ102A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether observance is a special virtue, distinct from other virtues?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS102.html#SSQ102A2THEP1">(2)</a> What does observance offer?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS102.html#SSQ102A3THEP1">(3)</a> Of its comparison with piety.

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that observance is not a special virtue, distinct from 
other virtues. For virtues are distinguished by their objects. But the 
object of observance is not distinct from the object of piety: for Tully 
says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "it is by observance that we pay worship 
and honor to those who excel in some kind of dignity." But worship and 
honor are paid also by piety to our parents, who excel in dignity. 
Therefore observance is not a distinct virtue from piety.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as honor and worship are due to those that are in a 
position of dignity, so also are they due to those who excel in science 
and virtue. But there is no special virtue whereby we pay honor and 
worship to those who excel in science and virtue. Therefore observance, 
whereby we pay worship and honor to those who excel in dignity, is not a 
special virtue distinct from other virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we have many duties towards those who are in a position 
of dignity, the fulfilment of which is required by law, according to Rm. 
13:7, "Render . . . to all men their dues: tribute  to whom tribute is 
due," etc. Now the fulfilment of the requirements of the law belongs to 
legal justice, or even to special justice. Therefore observance is not by 
itself a special virtue distinct from other virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) reckons observance along 
with the other parts of justice, which are special virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As explained above (<A Href="SS101.html#SSQ101OUTP1">Question [101]</a>, <A Href="SS101.html#SSQ101ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3; <A Href="SS080.html#SSQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>), according to 
the various excellences of those persons to whom something is due, there 
must needs be a corresponding distinction of virtues in a descending 
order. Now just as a carnal father partakes of the character of principle 
in a particular way, which character is found in God in a universal way, 
so too a person who, in some way, exercises providence in one respect, 
partakes of the character of father in a particular way, since a father 
is the principle of generation, of education, of learning and of whatever 
pertains to the perfection of human life: while a person who is in a 
position of dignity is as a principle of government with regard to 
certain things: for instance, the governor of a state in civil matters, 
the commander of an army in matters of warfare, a professor in matters of 
learning, and so forth. Hence it is that all such persons are designated 
as "fathers," on account of their being charged with like cares: thus the 
servants of Naaman said to him (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Kgs++5%3A13">4 Kgs. 5:13</a>): "Father, if the prophet had 
bid thee do some great thing," etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, just as, in a manner, religion, whereby worship is given to 
find piety, whereby we worship our so under piety we find observance, 
whereby worship and honor are paid to persons in positions of dignity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS101.html#SSQ101OUTP1">Question [101]</a>, <A Href="SS101.html#SSQ101A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2), religion goes by the 
name of piety by way of supereminence, although piety properly so called 
is distinct from religion; and in the same way piety can be called 
observance by way of excellence, although observance properly speaking is 
distinct from piety.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By the very fact of being in a position of dignity a man 
not only excels as regards his position, but also has a certain power of 
governing subjects, wherefore it is fitting that he should be considered 
as a principle inasmuch as he is the governor of others. On the other 
hand, the fact that a man has perfection of science and virtue does not 
give him the character of a principle in relation to others, but merely a 
certain excellence in himself. Wherefore a special virtue is appointed 
for the payment of worship and honor to persons in positions of dignity. 
Yet, forasmuch as science, virtue and all like things render a man fit 
for positions of dignity, the respect which is paid to anyone on account 
of any excellence whatever belongs to the same virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It belongs to special justice, properly speaking, to pay 
the equivalent to those to whom we owe anything. Now this  cannot be done 
to the virtuous, and to those who make good use of their position of 
dignity, as neither can it be done to God, nor to our parents. 
Consequently these matters belong to an annexed virtue, and not to 
special justice, which is a principal virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal justice extends to the acts of all the virtues, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it belongs to observance to pay worship and honor to those who are in positions of dignity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it does not belong to observance to pay worship and 
honor to persons in positions of dignity. For according to Augustine (De 
Civ. Dei x), we are said to worship those persons whom we hold in honor, 
so that worship and honor would seem to be the same. Therefore it is 
unfitting to define observance as paying worship and honor to persons in 
positions of dignity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to justice that we pay what we owe: wherefore 
this belongs to observance also, since it is a part of justice. Now we do 
not owe worship and honor to all persons in positions of dignity, but 
only to those who are placed over us. Therefore observance is unfittingly 
defined as giving worship and honor to all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, not only do we owe honor to persons of dignity who are 
placed over us; we owe them also fear and a certain payment of 
remuneration, according to Rm. 13:7, "Render . . . to all men their dues; 
tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; 
honor to whom honor." Moreover, we owe them reverence and subjection, 
according to Heb. 13:17, "Obey your prelates, and be subject to them." 
Therefore observance is not fittingly defined as paying worship and honor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "it is by 
observance that we pay worship and honor to those who excel in some kind 
of dignity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It belongs to persons in positions of dignity to govern 
subjects. Now to govern is to move certain ones to their due end: thus a 
sailor governs his ship by steering it to port. But every mover has a 
certain excellence and power over that which is moved. Wherefore, a 
person in a position of dignity is an object of twofold consideration: 
first, in so far as he obtains excellence of position, together with a 
certain power over subjects: secondly, as regards the exercise of his 
government. In respect of his excellence there is due to him honor, which 
is the recognition of some kind of excellence; and in respect of the 
exercise of his government, there is due to him worship, consisting in 
rendering him service, by obeying his commands, and by repaying him, 
according to one's faculty, for the benefits we received from him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Worship includes not only honor, but also  whatever other 
suitable actions are connected with the relations between man and man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS080.html#SSQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>), debt is twofold. One is legal 
debt, to pay which man is compelled by law; and thus man owes honor and 
worship to those persons in positions of dignity who are placed over him. 
The other is moral debt, which is due by reason of a certain honesty: it 
is in this way that we owe worship and honor to persons in positions of 
dignity even though we be not their subjects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Honor is due to the excellence of persons in positions of 
dignity, on account of their higher rank: while fear is due to them on 
account of their power to use compulsion: and to the exercise of their 
government there is due both obedience, whereby subjects are moved at the 
command of their superiors, and tributes, which are a repayment of their 
labor.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether observance is a greater virtue than piety?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that observance is a greater virtue than piety. For the 
prince to whom worship is paid by observance is compared to a father who 
is worshiped by piety, as a universal to a particular governor; because 
the household which a father governs is part of the state which is 
governed by the prince. Now a universal power is greater, and inferiors 
are more subject thereto. Therefore observance is a greater virtue than 
piety.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, persons in positions of dignity take care of the common 
good. Now our kindred pertain to the private good, which we ought to set 
aside for the common good: wherefore it is praiseworthy to expose oneself 
to the danger of death for the sake of the common good. Therefore 
observance, whereby worship is paid to persons in positions of dignity, 
is a greater virtue than piety, which pays worship to one's kindred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further honor and reverence are due to the virtuous in the first 
place after God. Now honor and reverence are paid to the virtuous by the 
virtue of observance, as stated above (<A Href="SS102.html#SSQ102A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3). Therefore observance 
takes the first place after religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The precepts of the Law prescribe acts of virtue. Now, 
immediately after the precepts of religion, which belong to the first 
table, follows the precept of honoring our parents which refers to piety. 
Therefore piety follows immediately after religion in the order of 
excellence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Something may be paid to persons in positions of dignity 
in two ways. First, in relation to the common good, as when one serves 
them in the administration of the affairs of the state. This no longer 
belongs to observance, but to piety, which pays worship not only to one's 
father but also to one's fatherland. Secondly, that which is paid to 
persons in positions of dignity  refers specially to their personal 
usefulness or renown, and this belongs properly to observance, as 
distinct from piety. Therefore in comparing observance with piety we must 
needs take into consideration the different relations in which other 
persons stand to ourselves, which relations both virtues regard. Now it 
is evident that the persons of our parents and of our kindred are more 
substantially akin to us than persons in positions of dignity, since 
birth and education, which originate in the father, belong more to one's 
substance than external government, the principle of which is seated in 
those who are in positions of dignity. For this reason piety takes 
precedence of observance, inasmuch as it pays worship to persons more 
akin to us, and to whom we are more strictly bound.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The prince is compared to the father as a universal to a 
particular power, as regards external government, but not as regards the 
father being a principle of generation: for in this way the father should 
be compared with the divine power from which all things derive their 
being.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In so far as persons in positions of dignity are related to 
the common good, their worship does not pertain to observance, but to 
piety, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[102] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The rendering of honor or worship should be proportionate 
to the person to whom it is paid not only as considered in himself, but 
also as compared to those who pay them. Wherefore, though virtuous 
persons, considered in themselves, are more worthy of honor than the 
persons of one's parents, yet children are under a greater obligation, on 
account of the benefits they have received from their parents and their 
natural kinship with them, to pay worship and honor to their parents than 
to virtuous persons who are not of their kindred.<br>
