<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the precepts of fortitude are not suitably given in 
the Divine Law. For the New Law is more perfect than the Old Law. Yet the 
Old Law contains precepts of fortitude (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++20">Dt. 20</a>). Therefore precepts of 
fortitude should have been given in  the New Law also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, affirmative precepts are of greater import than negative 
precepts, since the affirmative include the negative, but not vice versa. 
Therefore it is unsuitable for the Divine Law to contain none but 
negative precepts in prohibition of fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fortitude is one of the principal virtues, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now the precepts are directed to 
the virtues as to their end: wherefore they should be proportionate to 
them. Therefore the precepts of fortitude should have been placed among 
the precepts of the decalogue, which are the chief precepts of the Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> stands Holy Writ which contains these precepts.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Precepts of law are directed to the end intended by the 
lawgiver. Wherefore precepts of law must needs be framed in various ways 
according to the various ends intended by lawgivers, so that even in 
human affairs there are laws of democracies, others of kingdoms, and 
others again of tyrannical governments. Now the end of the Divine Law is 
that man may adhere to God: wherefore the Divine Law contains precepts 
both of fortitude and of the other virtues, with a view to directing the 
mind to God. For this reason it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++20:3,4">Dt. 20:3,4</a>): "Fear ye them 
not: because the Lord your God is in the midst of you, and will fight for 
you against your enemies."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to human laws, they are directed to certain earthly goods, and among 
them we find precepts of fortitude according to the requirements of those 
goods.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Old Testament contained temporal promises, while the 
promises of the New Testament are spiritual and eternal, according to 
Augustine (Contra Faust. iv). Hence in the Old Law there was need for the 
people to be taught how to fight, even in a bodily contest, in order to 
obtain an earthly possession. But in the New Testament men were to be 
taught how to come to the possession of eternal life by fighting 
spiritually, according to Mt. 11:12, "The kingdom of heaven suffereth 
violence, and the violent bear it away." Hence Peter commands (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Pt++5:8,9">1 Pt. 5:8,9</a>): "Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about, 
seeking whom he may devour: whom resist ye, strong in faith," as also 
James 4:7: "Resist the devil, and he will fly from you." Since, however, 
men while tending to spiritual goods may be withdrawn from them by 
corporal dangers, precepts of fortitude had to be given even in the New 
Law, that they might bravely endure temporal evils, according to Mt. 
10:28, "Fear ye not them that kill the body."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The law gives general directions in its precepts. But the 
things that have to be done in cases of danger are not, like the things 
to be avoided, reducible to some common thing. Hence the precepts of 
fortitude are negative rather than  affirmative.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS122.html#SSQ122OUTP1">Question [122]</a>, <A Href="SS122.html#SSQ122A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the precepts of the 
decalogue are placed in the Law, as first principles, which need to be 
known to all from the outset. Wherefore the precepts of the decalogue had 
to be chiefly about those acts of justice in which the notion of duty is 
manifest, and not about acts of fortitude, because it is not so evident 
that it is a duty for a person not to fear dangers of death.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the precepts of the parts of fortitude are suitably given in the Divine Law?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the precept of the parts of fortitude are 
unsuitably given in the Divine Law. For just as patience and perseverance 
are parts of fortitude, so also are magnificence, magnanimity, and 
confidence, as stated above (<A Href="SS128.html#SSQ128OUTP1">Question [128]</a>). Now we find precepts of patience in 
the Divine Law, as also of perseverance. Therefore there should also have 
been precepts of magnificence and magnanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, patience is a very necessary virtue, since it is the 
guardian of the other virtues, as Gregory says (Hom. in Evang. xxxv). Now 
the other virtues are commanded absolutely. Therefore patience should not 
have been commanded merely, as Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i), 
as to the preparedness of the mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, patience and perseverance are parts of fortitude, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS128.html#SSQ128OUTP1">Question [128]</a>; <A Href="SS136.html#SSQ136OUTP1">Question [136]</a>, <A Href="SS136.html#SSQ136A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="SS137.html#SSQ137OUTP1">Question [137]</a>, <A Href="SS137.html#SSQ137A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now the precepts of 
fortitude are not affirmative but only negative, as stated above (<A Href="SS140.html#SSQ140A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2). Therefore the precepts of patience and perseverance should have 
been negative and not affirmative.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The contrary, however, follows from the way in which they are given by 
Holy Writ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The Divine Law instructs man perfectly about such things 
as are necessary for right living. Now in order to live aright man needs 
not only the principal virtues, but also the secondary and annexed 
virtues. Wherefore the Divine Law contains precepts not only about the 
acts of the principal virtues, but also about the acts of the secondary 
and annexed virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Magnificence and magnanimity do not belong to the genus of 
fortitude, except by reason of a certain excellence of greatness which 
they regard in their respective matters. Now things pertaining to 
excellence come under the counsels of perfection rather than under 
precepts of obligation. Wherefore, there was need of counsels, rather 
than of precepts about magnificence and magnanimity. On the other hand, 
the hardships and toils of the present life pertain to patience and 
perseverance, not by reason of any greatness observable in them, but on 
account of the very nature  of those virtues. Hence the need of precepts 
of patience and perseverance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS003.html#SSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="SS003.html#SSQ3A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), although affirmative precepts 
are always binding, they are not binding for always, but according to 
place and time. Wherefore just as the affirmative precepts about the 
other virtues are to be understood as to the preparedness of the mind, in 
the sense that man be prepared to fulfil them when necessary, so too are 
the precepts of patience to be understood in the same way.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[140] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Fortitude, as distinct from patience and perseverance, is 
about the greatest dangers wherein one must proceed with caution; nor is 
it necessary to determine what is to be done in particular. On the other 
hand, patience and perseverance are about minor hardships and toils, 
wherefore there is less danger in determining, especially in general, 
what is to be done in such cases.<br>
