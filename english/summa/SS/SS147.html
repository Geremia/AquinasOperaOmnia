<H3 Align="Left">Whether fasting is an act of virtue?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that fasting is not an act of virtue. For every act 
of virtue is acceptable to God. But fasting is not always acceptable to 
God, according to Is. 58:3, "Why have we fasted and Thou hast not 
regarded?" Therefore fasting is not an act of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no act of virtue forsakes the mean of virtue. Now 
fasting forsakes the mean of virtue, which in the virtue of abstinence 
takes account of the necessity of supplying the needs of nature, whereas 
by fasting something is retrenched therefrom: else those who do not fast 
would not have the virtue of abstinence. Therefore fasting is not an act 
of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which is competent to all, both good and evil, is 
not an act of virtue. Now such is fasting, since every one is fasting 
before eating. Therefore fasting is not an act of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is reckoned together with other virtuous acts (2 
Cor. 6:5,6) where the Apostle says: "In fasting, in knowledge, in 
chastity, etc. [Vulg.: 'in chastity, in knowledge']."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> An act is virtuous through being directed by reason to 
some virtuous [honestum] [*Cf. Question [145], Article [1]] good. Now this is consistent 
with fasting, because fasting is practiced for a threefold purpose. 
First, in order to bridle the lusts of the flesh, wherefore the Apostle 
says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++6%3A5,6">2 Cor. 6:5,6</a>): "In fasting, in chastity," since fasting is the 
guardian of chastity. For, according to Jerome [*Contra Jov. ii.] "Venus 
is cold when Ceres and Bacchus are not there," that is to say, lust is 
cooled by abstinence in meat and drink. Secondly, we have recourse to 
fasting in order that the mind may arise more freely to the contemplation 
of heavenly things: hence it is related (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dan++10">Dan. 10</a>) of Daniel that he 
received a revelation from God after fasting for three weeks. Thirdly, in 
order to satisfy for sins: wherefore it is written (Joel 2:12): "Be 
converted to Me with all your heart, in fasting and in weeping and in 
mourning." The same is declared by Augustine in a sermon (De orat. et 
Jejun. [*Serm. lxxii (ccxxx, de Tempore)]): "Fasting cleanses the soul, 
raises the mind, subjects one's flesh to the spirit, renders the heart 
contrite and humble, scatters the clouds of concupiscence, quenches the 
fire of lust, kindles the true light of chastity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> An act that is virtuous generically may be rendered vicious 
by its connection with certain circumstances. Hence the text goes on to 
say: "Behold in the day of your fast your  own will is founded," and a 
little further on (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++58%3A4">Is. 58:4</a>): "You fast for debates and strife and strike 
with the fist wickedly." These words are expounded by Gregory (Pastor. 
iii, 19) as follows: "The will indicates joy and the fist anger. In vain 
then is the flesh restrained if the mind allowed to drift to inordinate 
movements be wrecked by vice." And Augustine says (in the same sermon) 
that "fasting loves not many words, deems wealth superfluous, scorns 
pride, commends humility, helps man to perceive what is frail and paltry."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The mean of virtue is measured not according to quantity 
but according to right reason, as stated in Ethic. ii, 6. Now reason 
judges it expedient, on account of some special motive, for a man to take 
less food than would be becoming to him under ordinary circumstances, for 
instance in order to avoid sickness, or in order to perform certain 
bodily works with greater ease: and much more does reason direct this to 
the avoidance of spiritual evils and the pursuit of spiritual goods. Yet 
reason does not retrench so much from one's food as to refuse nature its 
necessary support: thus Jerome says:* "It matters not whether thou art a 
long or a short time in destroying thyself, since to afflict the body 
immoderately, whether by excessive lack of nourishment, or by eating or 
sleeping too little, is to offer a sacrifice of stolen goods." [*The 
quotation is from the Corpus of Canon Law (Cap. Non mediocriter, De 
Consecrationibus, dist. 5). Gratian there ascribes the quotation to St. 
Jerome, but it is not to be found in the saint's works.] In like manner 
right reason does not retrench so much from a man's food as to render him 
incapable of fulfilling his duty. Hence Jerome says (in the same 
reference) "Rational man forfeits his dignity, if he sets fasting before 
chastity, or night-watchings before the well-being of his senses."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The fasting of nature, in respect of which a man is said to 
be fasting until he partakes of food, consists in a pure negation, 
wherefore it cannot be reckoned a virtuous act. Such is only the fasting 
of one who abstains in some measure from food for a reasonable purpose. 
Hence the former is called natural fasting [jejunium jejunii] [*Literally 
the 'fast of fasting']: while the latter is called the faster's fast, 
because he fasts for a purpose.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether fasting is an act of abstinence?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that fasting is not an act of abstinence. For 
Jerome [*The quotation is from the Ordinary Gloss, where the reference is 
lacking] commenting on Mt. 17:20, "This kind of devil" says: "To fast is 
to abstain not only from food but also from all manner of lusts." Now 
this belongs to every virtue. Therefore fasting is not exclusively an act 
of abstinence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory says in a Lenten Homily (xvi in Evang.) that 
"the Lenten fast is a tithe of the whole year." Now paying tithes is an 
act of religion, as stated above (<A Href="SS087.html#SSQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="SS087.html#SSQ87A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore fasting is an 
act of religion and not of abstinence. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, abstinence is a part of temperance, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [143]</a>,146, <A Href="SS000.html#SSQA1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3). Now temperance is condivided with fortitude, 
to which it belongs to endure hardships, and this seems very applicable 
to fasting. Therefore fasting is not an act of abstinence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says (Etym. vi, 19) that "fasting is frugality 
of fare and abstinence from food."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Habit and act have the same matter. Wherefore every 
virtuous act about some particular matter belongs to the virtue that 
appoints the mean in that matter. Now fasting is concerned with food, 
wherein the mean is appointed by abstinence. Wherefore it is evident that 
fasting is an act of abstinence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Properly speaking fasting consists in abstaining from food, 
but speaking metaphorically it denotes abstinence from anything harmful, 
and such especially is sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also reply that even properly speaking fasting is abstinence from 
all manner of lust, since, as stated above (<A Href="SS147.html#SSQ147A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), an act ceases to 
be virtuous by the conjunction of any vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Nothing prevents the act of one virtue belonging to another 
virtue, in so far as it is directed to the end of that virtue, as 
explained above (<A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS032.html#SSQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS032.html#SSQ32A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2; <A Href="SS085.html#SSQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="SS085.html#SSQ85A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Accordingly there is no 
reason why fasting should not be an act of religion, or of chastity, or 
of any other virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It belongs to fortitude as a special virtue, to endure, not 
any kind of hardship, but only those connected with the danger of death. 
To endure hardships resulting from privation of pleasure of touch, 
belongs to temperance and its parts: and such are the hardships of 
fasting.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that fasting is not a matter of precept. For 
precepts are not given about works of supererogation which are a matter 
of counsel. Now fasting is a work of supererogation: else it would have 
to be equally observed at all places and times. Therefore fasting is not 
a matter of precept.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever infringes a precept commits a mortal sin. 
Therefore if fasting were a matter of precept, all who do not fast would 
sin mortally, and a widespreading snare would be laid for men.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Vera Relig. 17) that "the Wisdom of 
God having taken human nature, and called us to a state of freedom, 
instituted a few most salutary sacraments whereby the community of the 
Christian people, that is, of the free multitude,  should be bound 
together in subjection to one God." Now the liberty of the Christian 
people seems to be hindered by a great number of observances no less than 
by a great number of sacraments. For Augustine says (Ad inquis. Januar., 
Ep. lv) that "whereas God in His mercy wished our religion to be 
distinguished by its freedom and the evidence and small number of its 
solemn sacraments, some people render it oppressive with slavish 
burdens." Therefore it seems that the Church should not have made fasting 
a matter of precept.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Jerome (Ad Lucin., Ep. lxxi) speaking of fasting says: 
"Let each province keep to its own practice, and look upon the commands 
of the elders as though they were laws of the apostles." Therefore 
fasting is a matter of precept.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Just as it belongs to the secular authority to make legal 
precepts which apply the natural law to matters of common weal in 
temporal affairs, so it belongs to ecclesiastical superiors to prescribe 
by statute those things that concern the common weal of the faithful in 
spiritual goods.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it has been stated above (<A Href="SS147.html#SSQ147A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that fasting is useful as atoning 
for and preventing sin, and as raising the mind to spiritual things. And 
everyone is bound by the natural dictate of reason to practice fasting as 
far as it is necessary for these purposes. Wherefore fasting in general 
is a matter of precept of the natural law, while the fixing of the time 
and manner of fasting as becoming and profitable to the Christian people, 
is a matter of precept of positive law established by ecclesiastical 
authority: the latter is the Church fast, the former is the fast 
prescribed by nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Fasting considered in itself denotes something not eligible 
but penal: yet it becomes eligible in so far as it is useful to some end. 
Wherefore considered absolutely it is not binding under precept, but it 
is binding under precept to each one that stands in need of such a 
remedy. And since men, for the most part, need this remedy, both because 
"in many things we all offend" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+3%3A2">James 3:2</a>), and because "the flesh 
lusteth against the spirit" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5%3A17">Gal. 5:17</a>), it was fitting that the Church 
should appoint certain fasts to be kept by all in common. In doing this 
the Church does not make a precept of a matter of supererogation, but 
particularizes in detail that which is of general obligation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those commandments which are given under the form of a 
general precept, do not bind all persons in the same way, but subject to 
the requirements of the end intended by the lawgiver. It will be a mortal 
sin to disobey a commandment through contempt of the lawgiver's 
authority, or to disobey it in such a way as to frustrate the end 
intended by him: but it is not a mortal sin if one fails to keep a 
commandment, when there is a reasonable motive, and especially if the 
lawgiver would not insist on its observance if he were present. Hence it 
is that not all, who do not keep the fasts of the Church, sin mortally. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Augustine is speaking there of those things "that are 
neither contained in the authorities of Holy Scripture, nor found among 
the ordinances of bishops in council, nor sanctioned by the custom of the 
universal Church." On the other hand, the fasts that are of obligation 
are appointed by the councils of bishops and are sanctioned by the custom 
of the universal Church. Nor are they opposed to the freedom of the 
faithful, rather are they of use in hindering the slavery of sin, which 
is opposed to spiritual freedom, of which it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5%3A13">Gal. 5:13</a>): 
"You, brethren, have been called unto liberty; only make not liberty an 
occasion to the flesh."<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all are bound to keep the fasts of the Church. 
For the commandments of the Church are binding even as the commandments 
of God, according to Lk. 10:16, "He that heareth you heareth Me." Now all 
are bound to keep the commandments of God. Therefore in like manner all 
are bound to keep the fasts appointed by the Church.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, children especially are seemingly not exempt from 
fasting, on account of their age: for it is written (Joel 2:15): 
"Sanctify a fast," and further on (Joel 2:16): "Gather together the 
little ones, and them that suck the breasts." Much more therefore are all 
others bound to keen the fasts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, spiritual things should be preferred to temporal, and 
necessary things to those that are not necessary. Now bodily works are 
directed to temporal gain; and pilgrimages, though directed to spiritual 
things, are not a matter of necessity. Therefore, since fasting is 
directed to a spiritual gain, and is made a necessary thing by the 
commandment of the Church, it seems that the fasts of the Church ought 
not to be omitted on account of a pilgrimage, or bodily works.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is better to do a thing willingly than through 
necessity, as stated in 2 Cor. 9:7. Now the poor are wont to fast through 
necessity, owing to lack of food. Much more therefore ought they to fast 
willingly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It seems that no righteous man is bound to fast. For 
the commandments of the Church are not binding in opposition to Christ's 
teaching. But our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++5%3A34">Lk. 5:34</a>) that "the children of the 
bridegroom cannot fast whilst the bridegroom is with them [*Vulg.: 'Can 
you make the children of the bridegroom fast, whilst the bridegroom is 
with them?']." Now He is with all the righteous by dwelling in them in a 
special manner [*Cf. FP, Question [8], Article [3]], wherefore our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++28%3A20">Mt. 28:20</a>): "Behold I am with you . . . even to the consummation of the 
world." Therefore the righteous are not bound by the commandment of the 
Church to fast.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS090.html#FSQ90A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS098.html#FSQ98OUTP1">Question [98]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS098.html#FSQ98ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,6), 
general precepts are framed according to the requirements of the many. 
Wherefore in making such precepts the lawgiver considers what happens 
generally and for the most part, and he does not intend the precept to be 
binding on a person in whom for some special reason there is something 
incompatible with observance of the precept. Yet discretion must be 
brought to bear on the point. For if the reason be evident, it is lawful 
for a man to use his own judgment in omitting to fulfil the precept, 
especially if custom be in his favor, or if it be difficult for him to 
have recourse to superior authority. on the other hand, if the reason be 
doubtful, one should have recourse to the superior who has power to grant 
a dispensation in such cases. And this must be done in the fasts 
appointed by the Church, to which all are bound in general, unless there 
be some special obstacle to this observance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The commandments of God are precepts of the natural law, 
which are, of themselves, necessary for salvation. But the commandments 
of the Church are about matters which are necessary for salvation, not of 
themselves, but only through the ordinance of the Church. Hence there may 
be certain obstacles on account of which certain persons are not bound to 
keep the fasts in question.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In children there is a most evident reason for not fasting, 
both on account of their natural weakness, owing to which they need to 
take food frequently, and not much at a time, and because they need much 
nourishment owing to the demands of growth, which results from the 
residuum of nourishment. Wherefore as long as the stage of growth lasts, 
which as a rule lasts until they have completed the third period of seven 
years, they are not bound to keep the Church fasts: and yet it is fitting 
that even during that time they should exercise themselves in fasting, 
more or less, in accordance with their age. Nevertheless when some great 
calamity threatens, even children are commanded to fast, in sign of more 
severe penance, according to Jonas 3:7, "Let neither men nor beasts . . . 
taste anything . . . nor drink water."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Apparently a distinction should be made with regard to 
pilgrims and working people. For if the pilgrimage or laborious work can 
be conveniently deferred or lessened without detriment to the bodily 
health and such external conditions as are necessary for the upkeep of 
bodily or spiritual life, there is no reason for omitting the fasts of 
the Church. But if one be under the necessity of starting on the 
pilgrimage at once, and of making long stages, or of doing much work, 
either for one's bodily livelihood, or for some need of the spiritual 
life, and it be impossible at the same time to keep the fasts of the 
Church, one is not bound to fast: because in ordering fasts the Church 
would not seem to have intended to prevent other pious and more necessary 
undertakings. Nevertheless, in such cases one ought seemingly, to seek 
the superior's dispensation; except perhaps when the above course is 
recognized by custom, since when superiors are silent they would seem to 
consent. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Those poor who can provide themselves with sufficient for 
one meal are not excused, on account of poverty, from keeping the fasts 
of the Church. On the other hand, those would seem to be exempt who beg 
their food piecemeal, since they are unable at any one time to have a 
sufficiency of food.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> This saying of our Lord may be expounded in three ways. 
First, according to Chrysostom (Hom. xxx in Matth.), who says that "the 
disciples, who are called children of the bridegroom, were as yet of a 
weakly disposition, wherefore they are compared to an old garment." Hence 
while Christ was with them in body they were to be fostered with kindness 
rather than drilled with the harshness of fasting. According to this 
interpretation, it is fitting that dispensations should be granted to the 
imperfect and to beginners, rather than to the elders and the perfect, 
according to a gloss on Ps. 130:2, "As a child that is weaned is towards 
his mother." Secondly, we may say with Jerome [*Bede, Comment. in Luc. v] 
that our Lord is speaking here of the fasts of the observances of the Old 
Law. Wherefore our Lord means to say that the apostles were not to be 
held back by the old observances, since they were to be filled with the 
newness of grace. Thirdly, according to Augustine (De Consensu Evang. ii, 
27), who states that fasting is of two kinds. one pertains to those who 
are humbled by disquietude, and this is not befitting perfect men, for 
they are called "children of the bridegroom"; hence when we read in Luke: 
"The children of the bridegroom cannot fast [*Hom. xiii, in Matth.]," we 
read in Mt. 9:15: "The children of the bridegroom cannot mourn [*Vulg.: 
'Can the children of the bridegroom mourn?']." The other pertains to the 
mind that rejoices in adhering to spiritual things: and this fasting is 
befitting the perfect.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the times for the Church fast are unfittingly 
appointed. For we read (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++4">Mt. 4</a>) that Christ began to fast immediately 
after being baptized. Now we ought to imitate Christ, according to 1 Cor. 
4:16, "Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ." Therefore we ought 
to fast immediately after the Epiphany when Christ's baptism is 
celebrated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is unlawful in the New Law to observe the ceremonies 
of the Old Law. Now it belongs to the solemnities of the Old Law to fast 
in certain particular months: for it is written (Zach. 8:19): "The fast 
of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the 
seventh, and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Judah, joy 
and gladness and great solemnities." Therefore the fast of certain 
months, which are called Ember days, are unfittingly kept in the Church.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine (De Consensu Evang. ii, 27), just 
as there is a fast "of sorrow," so is there a fast "of joy." Now it is 
most becoming that the faithful should rejoice  spiritually in Christ's 
Resurrection. Therefore during the five weeks which the Church solemnizes 
on account of Christ's Resurrection, and on Sundays which commemorate the 
Resurrection, fasts ought to be appointed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the general custom of the Church.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[5] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS147.html#SSQ147ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3), fasting is directed to two 
things, the deletion of sin, and the raising of the mind to heavenly 
things. Wherefore fasting ought to be appointed specially for those 
times, when it behooves man to be cleansed from sin, and the minds of the 
faithful to be raised to God by devotion: and these things are 
particularly requisite before the feast of Easter, when sins are loosed 
by baptism, which is solemnly conferred on Easter-eve, on which day our 
Lord's burial is commemorated, because "we are buried together with 
Christ by baptism unto death" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++6%3A4">Rm. 6:4</a>). Moreover at the Easter festival 
the mind of man ought to be devoutly raised to the glory of eternity, 
which Christ restored by rising from the dead, and so the Church ordered 
a fast to be observed immediately before the Paschal feast; and for the 
same reason, on the eve of the chief festivals, because it is then that 
one ought to make ready to keep the coming feast devoutly. Again it is 
the custom in the Church for Holy orders to be conferred every quarter of 
the year (in sign whereof our Lord fed four thousand men with seven 
loaves, which signify the New Testament year as Jerome says [*Comment. in 
Marc. viii]): and then both the ordainer, and the candidates for 
ordination, and even the whole people, for whose good they are ordained, 
need to fast in order to make themselves ready for the ordination. Hence 
it is related (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++6%3A12">Lk. 6:12</a>) that before choosing His disciples our Lord 
"went out into a mountain to pray": and Ambrose [*Exposit. in Luc.] 
commenting on these words says: "What shouldst thou do, when thou 
desirest to undertake some pious work, since Christ prayed before sending 
His apostles?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[5] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the forty day's fast, according to Gregory (Hom. xvi in 
Evang.) there are three reasons for the number. First, "because the power 
of the Decalogue is accomplished in the four books of the Holy Gospels: 
since forty is the product of ten multiplied by four." Or "because we are 
composed of four elements in this mortal body through whose lusts we 
transgress the Lord's commandments which are delivered to us in the 
Decalogue. Wherefore it is fitting we should punish that same body forty 
times. or, because, just as under the Law it was commanded that tithes 
should be paid of things, so we strive to pay God a tithe of days, for 
since a year is composed of three hundred and sixty-six days, by 
punishing ourselves for thirty-six days" (namely, the fasting days during 
the six weeks of Lent) "we pay God a tithe of our year." According to 
Augustine (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 16) a fourth reason may be added. For 
the Creator is the "Trinity," Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: while the 
number "three" refers to the invisible creature, since we are commanded 
to love God, with our whole heart, with our whole soul, and with our 
whole mind: and the number "four" refers to the visible creature, by 
reason of heat, cold, wet and dry. Thus the number "ten" [*Ten is the sum 
of three, three, and  four] signifies all things, and if this be 
multiplied by four which refers to the body whereby we make use of 
things, we have the number forty.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[5] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Each fast of the Ember days is composed of three days, on account of the 
number of months in each season: or on account of the number of Holy 
orders which are conferred at these times.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ needed not baptism for His own sake, but in order to 
commend baptism to us. Wherefore it was competent for Him to fast, not 
before, but after His baptism, in order to invite us to fast before our 
baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Church keeps the Ember fasts, neither at the very same 
time as the Jews, nor for the same reasons. For they fasted in July, 
which is the fourth month from April (which they count as the first), 
because it was then that Moses coming down from Mount Sinai broke the 
tables of the Law (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++32">Ex. 32</a>), and that, according to Jer. 39%3A2, "the walls 
of the city were first broken through." In the fifth month, which we call 
August, they fasted because they were commanded not to go up on to the 
mountain, when the people had rebelled on account of the spies (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Num++14">Num. 14</a>): 
also in this month the temple of Jerusalem was burnt down by 
Nabuchodonosor (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++52">Jer. 52</a>) and afterwards by Titus. In the seventh month 
which we call October, Godolias was slain, and the remnants of the people 
were dispersed (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++51">Jer. 51</a>). In the tenth month, which we call January, the 
people who were with Ezechiel in captivity heard of the destruction of 
the temple (Ezech. 4).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The "fasting of joy" proceeds from the instigation of the 
Holy Ghost Who is the Spirit of liberty, wherefore this fasting should 
not be a matter of precept. Accordingly the fasts appointed by the 
commandment of the Church are rather "fasts of sorrow" which are 
inconsistent with days of joy. For this reason fasting is not ordered by 
the Church during the whole of the Paschal season, nor on Sundays: and if 
anyone were to fast at these times in contradiction to the custom of 
Christian people, which as Augustine declares (Ep. xxxvi) "is to be 
considered as law," or even through some erroneous opinion (thus the 
Manichees fast, because they deem such fasting to be of obligation)---he 
would not be free from sin. Nevertheless fasting considered in itself is 
commendable at all times; thus Jerome wrote (Ad Lucin., Ep. lxxi): "Would 
that we might fast always."<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not requisite for fasting that one eat 
but once. For, as stated above (<A Href="SS147.html#SSQ147A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), fasting is an act of the virtue of 
abstinence, which observes due quantity of food not less than the number 
of meals. Now the quantity of food is not limited for those who fast. 
Therefore neither should the number of meals be limited.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Just as man is nourished by meat, so is he by drink: 
wherefore drink breaks the fast, and for this reason we cannot receive 
the Eucharist after drinking. Now we are not forbidden to drink at 
various hours of the day. Therefore those who fast should not be 
forbidden to eat several times.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, digestives are a kind of food: and yet many take them on 
fasting days after eating. Therefore it is not essential to fasting to 
take only one meal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the common custom of the Christian people.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Fasting is instituted by the Church in order to bridle 
concupiscence, yet so as to safeguard nature. Now only one meal is 
seemingly sufficient for this purpose, since thereby man is able to 
satisfy nature; and yet he withdraws something from concupiscence by 
minimizing the number of meals. Therefore it is appointed by the Church, 
in her moderation, that those who fast should take one meal in the day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It was not possible to fix the same quantity of food for 
all, on account of the various bodily temperaments, the result being that 
one person needs more, and another less food: whereas, for the most part, 
all are able to satisfy nature by only one meal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Fasting is of two kinds [*Cf. Article [1], ad 3]. One is the 
natural fast, which is requisite for receiving the Eucharist. This is 
broken by any kind of drink, even of water, after which it is not lawful 
to receive the Eucharist. The fast of the Church is another kind and is 
called the "fasting of the faster," and this is not broken save by such 
things as the Church intended to forbid in instituting the fast. Now the 
Church does not intend to command abstinence from drink, for this is 
taken more for bodily refreshment, and digestion of the food consumed, 
although it nourishes somewhat. It is, however, possible to sin and lose 
the merit of fasting, by partaking of too much drink: as also by eating 
immoderately at one meal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although digestives nourish somewhat they are not taken 
chiefly for nourishment, but for digestion. Hence one does not break 
one's fast by taking them or any other medicines, unless one were to take 
digestives, with a fraudulent intention, in great quantity and by way of 
food.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the ninth hour is not suitably fixed for the 
faster's meal. For the state of the New Law is more perfect than the 
state of the Old Law. Now in the Old Testament they fasted until evening, 
for it is written (Lev. 23:32): "It is a sabbath . . . you shall afflict 
your souls," and then the text continues:  "From evening until evening 
you shall celebrate your sabbaths." Much more therefore under the New 
Testament should the fast be ordered until the evening.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the fast ordered by the Church is binding on all. But 
all are not able to know exactly the ninth hour. Therefore it seems that 
the fixing of the ninth hour should not form part of the commandment to 
fast.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fasting is an act of the virtue of abstinence, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS147.html#SSQ147A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now the mean of moral virtue does not apply in the same way 
to all, since what is much for one is little for another, as stated in 
Ethic. ii, 6. Therefore the ninth hour should not be fixed for those who 
fast.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Council of Chalons [*The quotation is from the 
Capitularies (Cap. 39) of Theodulf, bishop of Orleans (760-821) and is 
said to be found in the Corpus Juris, Cap. Solent, dist. 1, De 
Consecratione] says: "During Lent those are by no means to be credited 
with fasting who eat before the celebration of the office of Vespers," 
which in the Lenten season is said after the ninth hour. Therefore we 
ought to fast until the ninth hour.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[7] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS147.html#SSQ147ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3,5), fasting is directed to the 
deletion and prevention of sin. Hence it ought to add something to the 
common custom, yet so as not to be a heavy burden to nature. Now the 
right and common custom is for men to eat about the sixth hour: both 
because digestion is seemingly finished (the natural heat being withdrawn 
inwardly at night-time on account of the surrounding cold of the night), 
and the humor spread about through the limbs (to which result the heat of 
the day conduces until the sun has reached its zenith), and again because 
it is then chiefly that the nature of the human body needs assistance 
against the external heat that is in the air, lest the humors be parched 
within. Hence, in order that those who fast may feel some pain in 
satisfaction for their sins, the ninth hour is suitably fixed for their 
meal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[7] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, this hour agrees with the mystery of Christ's Passion, which 
was brought to a close at the ninth hour, when "bowing His head, He gave 
up the ghost" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++19%3A30">Jn. 19:30</a>): because those who fast by punishing their 
flesh, are conformed to the Passion of Christ, according to Gal. 5:24, 
"They that are Christ's, have crucified their flesh with the vices and 
concupiscences."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The state of the Old Testament is compared to the night, 
while the state of the New Testament is compared to the day, according to 
Rm. 13:12, "The night is passed and the day is at hand." Therefore in the 
Old Testament they fasted until night, but not in the New Testament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Fasting requires a fixed hour based, not on a strict 
calculation, but on a rough estimate: for it suffices that it be about 
the ninth hour, and this is easy for anyone to  ascertain.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A little more or a little less cannot do much harm. Now it 
is not a long space of time from the sixth hour at which men for the most 
part are wont to eat, until the ninth hour, which is fixed for those who 
fast. Wherefore the fixing of such a time cannot do much harm to anyone, 
whatever his circumstances may be. If however this were to prove a heavy 
burden to a man on account of sickness, age, or some similar reason, he 
should be dispensed from fasting, or be allowed to forestall the hour by 
a little.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unfitting that those who fast should be bidden to 
abstain from flesh meat, eggs, and milk foods. For it has been stated 
above (<A Href="SS147.html#SSQ147A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>) that fasting was instituted as a curb on the concupiscence 
of the flesh. Now concupiscence is kindled by drinking wine more than by 
eating flesh; according to Prov. 20:1, "Wine is a luxurious thing," and 
Eph. 5:18, "Be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury." Since then those 
who fast are not forbidden to drink wine, it seems that they should not 
be forbidden to eat flesh meat.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, some fish are as delectable to eat as the flesh of 
certain animals. Now "concupiscence is desire of the delectable," as 
stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS030.html#FSQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS030.html#FSQ30A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore since fasting which was 
instituted in order to bridle concupiscence does not exclude the eating 
of fish, neither should it exclude the eating of flesh meat.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, on certain fasting days people make use of eggs and 
cheese. Therefore one can likewise make use of them during the Lenten 
fast.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the common custom of the faithful.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS147.html#SSQ147A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), fasting was instituted by the 
Church in order to bridle the concupiscences of the flesh, which regard 
pleasures of touch in connection with food and sex. Wherefore the Church 
forbade those who fast to partake of those foods which both afford most 
pleasure to the palate, and besides are a very great incentive to lust. 
Such are the flesh of animals that take their rest on the earth, and of 
those that breathe the air and their products, such as milk from those 
that walk on the earth, and eggs from birds. For, since such like animals 
are more like man in body, they afford greater pleasure as food, and 
greater nourishment to the human body, so that from their consumption 
there results a greater surplus available for seminal matter, which when 
abundant becomes a great incentive to lust. Hence the Church has bidden 
those who fast to abstain especially from these foods.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Three things concur in the act of procreation, namely, 
heat, spirit [*Cf. P. I., Q. 118, Article [1], ad 3], and humor. Wine and other 
things that heat the body conduce especially to heat: flatulent foods 
seemingly cooperate in the production of the vital spirit: but it is 
chiefly the use of flesh meat which is most productive of nourishment, 
that conduces to the production of humor. Now the alteration occasioned 
by heat, and the increase in vital spirits are of short duration, whereas 
the substance of the humor remains a long time. Hence those who fast are 
forbidden the use of flesh meat rather than of wine or vegetables which 
are flatulent foods.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In the institution of fasting, the Church takes account of 
the more common occurrences. Now, generally speaking, eating flesh meat 
affords more pleasure than eating fish, although this is not always the 
case. Hence the Church forbade those who fast to eat flesh meat, rather 
than to eat fish.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[147] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Eggs and milk foods are forbidden to those who fast, for as 
much as they originate from animals that provide us with flesh: wherefore 
the prohibition of flesh meat takes precedence of the prohibition of eggs 
and milk foods. Again the Lenten fast is the most solemn of all, both 
because it is kept in imitation of Christ, and because it disposes us to 
celebrate devoutly the mysteries of our redemption. For this reason the 
eating of flesh meat is forbidden in every fast, while the Lenten fast 
lays a general prohibition even on eggs and milk foods. As to the use of 
the latter things in other fasts the custom varies among different 
people, and each person is bound to conform to that custom which is in 
vogue with those among whom he is dwelling. Hence Jerome says 
[*Augustine, De Lib. Arb. iii, 18; cf. De Nat. et Grat. lxvii]: "Let each 
province keep to its own practice, and look upon the commands of the 
elders as though they were the laws of the apostles."<br>
