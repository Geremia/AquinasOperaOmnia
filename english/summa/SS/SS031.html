  <h3 align="center">OF BENEFICENCE (FOUR ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the outward acts or effects of charity, (1)
    Beneficence, (2) Almsdeeds, which are a part of beneficence, (3) Fraternal
    correction, which is a kind of alms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS031.html#SSQ31A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether beneficence is an act of
    charity ?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS031.html#SSQ31A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether we ought to be beneficent
    to all?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS031.html#SSQ31A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether we ought to be more
    beneficent to those who are more closely united to us?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS031.html#SSQ31A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether beneficence is a special
    virtue?

  <h3 align="left">Whether beneficence is an act of charity?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that beneficence is not an act of
    charity. For charity is chiefly directed to God. Now we cannot benefit God,
    according to Job 35:7: "What shalt thou give Him? or what shall He receive
    of thy hand?" Therefore beneficence is not an act of charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, beneficence consists chiefly in making
    gifts. But this belongs to liberality. Therefore beneficence is an act of
    liberality and not of charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what a man gives, he gives either as
    being due, or as not due. But a benefit conferred as being due belongs to
    justice while a benefit conferred as not due, is gratuitous, and in this
    respect is an act of mercy. Therefore every benefit conferred is either an
    act of justice, or an act of mercy. Therefore it is not an act of
    charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Charity is a kind of friendship, as stated
    above (<a href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>,
    <a href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now the Philosopher
    reckons among the acts of friendship (Ethic. ix, 1) "doing good," i.e. being
    beneficent, "to one's friends." Therefore it is an act of charity to do good
    to others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Beneficence simply means doing good to someone.
    This good may be considered in two ways, first under the general aspect of
    good, and this belongs to beneficence in general, and is an act of
    friendship, and, consequently, of charity: because the act of love includes
    goodwill whereby a man wishes his friend well, as stated above (<a
      href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1"
      >Question [23]</a
    >, <a href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="SS027.html#SSQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>,
    <a href="SS027.html#SSQ27A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now the will carries
    into effect if possible, the things it wills, so that, consequently, the
    result of an act of love is that a man is beneficent to his friend.
    Therefore beneficence in its general acceptation is an act of friendship or
    charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if the good which one man does another, be considered under some special
    aspect of good, then beneficence will assume a special character and will
    belong to some special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv),
    "love moves those, whom it unites, to a mutual relationship: it turns the
    inferior to the superior to be perfected thereby; it moves the superior to
    watch over the inferior:" and in this respect beneficence is an effect of
    love. Hence it is not for us to benefit God, but to honor Him by obeying
    Him, while it is for Him, out of His love, to bestow good things on us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Two things must be observed in the
    bestowal of gifts. One is the thing given outwardly, while the other is the
    inward passion that a man has in the delight of riches. It belongs to
    liberality to moderate this inward passion so as to avoid excessive desire
    and love for riches; for this makes a man more ready to part with his
    wealth. Hence, if a man makes some great gift, while yet desiring to keep it
    for himself, his is not a liberal giving. On the other hand, as regards the
    outward gift, the act of beneficence belongs in general to friendship or
    charity. Hence it does not detract from a man's friendship, if, through
    love, he give his friend something he would like to I keep for himself;
    rather does this prove the perfection of his friendship.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as friendship or charity sees, in
    the benefit bestowed, the general aspect of good, so does justice see
    therein the aspect of debt, while pity considers the relieving of distress
    or defect.<br />

    ><br />
  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether we ought to do good to all?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we are not bound to do good to
    all. For Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 28) that we "are unable to do
    good to everyone." Now virtue does not incline one to the impossible.
    Therefore it is not necessary to do good to all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (Ecclus. 12:5) "Give to
    the good, and receive not a sinner." But many men are sinners. Therefore we
    need not do good to all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "Charity dealeth not perversely" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++13%3A4"
      >1 Cor. 13:4</a
    >). Now to do good to some is to deal perversely: for instance if one were
    to do good to an enemy of the common weal, or if one were to do good to an
    excommunicated person, since, by doing so, he would be holding communion
    with him. Therefore, since beneficence is an act of charity, we ought not to
    do good to all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++6%3A10"
      >Gal. 6:10</a
    >): "Whilst we have time, let us work good to all men."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS031.html#SSQ31A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 1), beneficence is an effect of love in so far as love moves the
    superior to watch over the inferior. Now degrees among men are not
    unchangeable as among angels, because men are subject to many failings, so
    that he who is superior in one respect, is or may be inferior in another.
    Therefore, since the love of charity extends to all, beneficence also should
    extend to all, but according as time and place require: because all acts of
    virtue must be modified with a view to their due circumstances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Absolutely speaking it is impossible to
    do good to every single one: yet it is true of each individual that one may
    be bound to do good to him in some particular case. Hence charity binds us,
    though not actually doing good to someone, to be prepared in mind to do good
    to anyone if we have time to spare. There is however a good that we can do
    to all, if not to each individual, at least to all in general, as when we
    pray for all, for unbelievers as well as for the faithful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In a sinner there are two things, his
    guilt and his nature. Accordingly we are bound to succor the sinner as to
    the maintenance of his nature, but not so as to abet his sin, for this would
    be to do evil rather than good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The excommunicated and the enemies of
    the common weal are deprived of all beneficence, in so far as this prevents
    them from doing evil deeds. Yet if their nature be in urgent need of succor
    lest it fail, we are bound to help them: for instance, if they be in danger
    of death through hunger or thirst, or suffer some like distress, unless this
    be according to the order of justice.<br />

    Whether we ought to do good to those rather who are more closely united to
    us?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we are nor bound to do good to
    those rather who are more closely united to us. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++14%3A12"
      >Lk. 14:12</a
    >): "When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy
    brethren, nor thy kinsmen." Now these are the most closely united to us.
    Therefore we are not bound to do good to those rather who are more closely
    united to us, but preferably to strangers and to those who are in want:
    hence the text goes on: "But, when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the
    maimed," etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to help another in the battle is an act
    of very great goodness. But a soldier on the battlefield is bound to help a
    fellow-soldier who is a stranger rather than a kinsman who is a foe.
    Therefore in doing acts of kindness we are not bound to give the preference
    to those who are most closely united to us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we should pay what is due before
    conferring gratuitous favors. But it is a man's duty to be good to those who
    have been good to him. Therefore we ought to do good to our benefactors
    rather than to those who are closely united to us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a man ought to love his parents more
    than his children, as stated above (<a href="SS026.html#SSQ26OUTP1"
      >Question [26]</a
    >, <a href="SS026.html#SSQ26A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>). Yet a man ought to be
    more beneficent to his children, since "neither ought the children to lay up
    for the parents," according to 2 Cor. 12:14. Therefore we are not bound to
    be more beneficent to those who are more closely united to us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 28):
    "Since one cannot do good to all, we ought to consider those chiefly who by
    reason of place, time or any other circumstance, by a kind of chance are
    more closely united to us."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Grace and virtue imitate the order of nature,
    which is established by Divine wisdom. Now the order of nature is such that
    every natural agent pours forth its activity first and most of all on the
    things which are nearest to it: thus fire heats most what is next to it. In
    like manner God pours forth the gifts of His goodness first and most
    plentifully on the substances which are nearest to Him, as Dionysius
    declares (Coel. Hier. vii). But the bestowal of benefits is an act of
    charity towards others. Therefore we ought to be most beneficent towards
    those who are most closely connected with us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now one man's connection with another may be measured in reference to the
    various matters in which men are engaged together; (thus the intercourse of
    kinsmen is in natural matters, that of fellow-citizens is in civic matters,
    that of the faithful is in spiritual matters, and so forth): and various
    benefits should be conferred in various ways according to these various
    connections, because we ought in preference to bestow on each one such
    benefits as pertain to the matter in which, speaking simply, he is most
    closely connected with us. And yet this may vary according to the various
    requirements of time, place, or matter in hand: because in certain cases one
    ought, for instance, to succor a stranger, in extreme necessity, rather than
    one's own father, if he is not in such urgent need.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Our Lord did not absolutely forbid us to
    invite our friends and kinsmen to eat with us, but to invite them so that
    they may invite us in return, since that would be an act not of charity but
    of cupidity. The case may occur, however, that one ought rather to invite
    strangers, on account of their greater want. For it must be understood that,
    other things being equal, one ought to succor those rather who are most
    closely connected with us. And if of two, one be more closely connected, and
    the other in greater want, it is not possible to decide, by any general
    rule, which of them we ought to help rather than the other, since there are
    various degrees of want as well as of connection: and the matter requires
    the judgment of a prudent man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The common good of many is more Godlike
    than the good of an individual. Wherefore it is a virtuous action for a man
    to endanger even his own life, either for the spiritual or for the temporal
    common good of his country. Since therefore men engage together in warlike
    acts in order to safeguard the common weal, the soldier who with this in
    view succors his comrade, succors him not as a private individual, but with
    a view to the welfare of his country as a whole: wherefore it is not a
    matter for wonder if a stranger be preferred to one who is a blood
    relation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A thing may be due in two ways. There is
    one which should be reckoned, not among the goods of the debtor, but rather
    as belonging to the person to whom it is due: for instance, a man may have
    another's goods, whether in money or in kind, either because he has stolen
    them, or because he has received them on loan or in deposit or in some other
    way. In this case a man ought to pay what he owes, rather than benefit his
    connections out of it, unless perchance the case be so urgent that it would
    be lawful for him to take another's property in order to relieve the one who
    is in need. Yet, again, this would not apply if the creditor were in equal
    distress: in which case, however, the claims on either side would have to be
    weighed with regard to such other conditions as a prudent man would take
    into consideration, because, on account of the different particular cases,
    as the Philosopher states (Ethic. ix, 2), it is impossible to lay down a
    general rule.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The other kind of due is one which is reckoned among the goods of the debtor
    and not of the creditor; for instance, a thing may be due, not because
    justice requires it, but on account of a certain moral equity, as in the
    case of benefits received gratis. Now no benefactor confers a benefit equal
    to that which a man receives from his parents: wherefore in paying back
    benefits received, we should give the first place to our parents before all
    others, unless, on the other side, there be such weightier motives, as need
    or some other circumstance, for instance the common good of the Church or
    state. In other cases we must take to account the connection and the benefit
    received; and here again no general rule can laid down.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Parents are like superiors, and so a
    parent's love tends to conferring benefits, while the children's love tends
    to honor their parents. Nevertheless in a case of extreme urgency it would
    be lawful to abandon one's children rather than one's parents, to abandon
    whom it is by no means lawful, on account of the obligation we lie under
    towards them for the benefits we have received from them, as the Philosopher
    states (Ethic. iii, 14).<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether beneficence is a special virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that beneficence is a special
    virtue. For precepts are directed to virtue, since lawgivers purpose to make
    men virtuous (Ethic. i 9,13; ii, 1). Now beneficence and love are prescribed
    as distinct from one another, for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++4%3A44"
      >Mt. 4:44</a
    >): "Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you." Therefore
    beneficence is a virtue distinct from charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, vices are opposed to virtues. Now there
    are opposed to beneficence certain vices whereby a hurt is inflicted on our
    neighbor, for instance, rapine, theft and so forth. Therefore beneficence is
    a special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity is not divided into several
    species: whereas there would seem to be several kinds of beneficence,
    according to the various kinds of benefits. Therefore beneficence is a
    distinct virtue from charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The internal and the external act do not
    require different virtues. Now beneficence and goodwill differ only as
    external and internal act, since beneficence is the execution of goodwill.
    Therefore as goodwill is not a distinct virtue from charity, so neither is
    beneficence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Virtues differ according to the different
    aspects of their objects. Now the formal aspect of the object of charity and
    of beneficence is the same, since both virtues regard the common aspect of
    good, as explained above (<a href="SS031.html#SSQ31A1THEP1">Article [1]</a
    >). Wherefore beneficence is not a distinct virtue from charity, but denotes
    an act of charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Precepts are given, not about habits but
    about acts of virtue: wherefore distinction of precept denotes distinction,
    not of habits, but of acts.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even as all benefits conferred on our
    neighbor, if we consider them under the common aspect of good, are to be
    traced to love, so all hurts considered under the common aspect of evil, are
    to be traced to hatred. But if we consider these same things under certain
    special aspects of good or of evil, they are to be traced to certain special
    virtues or vices, and in this way also there are various kinds of
    benefits.<br />

  <p>Hence the Reply to the Third Objection is evident.</p>
