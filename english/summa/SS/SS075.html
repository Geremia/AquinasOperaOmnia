    We must now speak of derision, under which head there are two points of
    inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS075.html#SSQ75A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether derision is a special sin
    distinct from the other sins whereby one's neighbor is injured by words?<br />

    Whether derision is a special sin distinct from those already mentioned?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that derision is not a special sin
    distinct from those mentioned above. For laughing to scorn is apparently the
    same as derision. But laughing to scorn pertains to reviling. Therefore
    derision would seem not to differ from reviling.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no man is derided except for something
    reprehensible which puts him to shame. Now such are sins; and if they be
    imputed to a person publicly, it is a case of reviling, if privately, it
    amounts to backbiting or tale-bearing. Therefore derision is not distinct
    from the foregoing vices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sins of this kind are distinguished by
    the injury they inflict on one's neighbor. Now the injury inflicted on a man
    by derision affects either his honor, or his good name, or is detrimental to
    his friendship. Therefore derision is not a sin distinct from the
    foregoing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Derision is done in jest, wherefore it is
    described as "making fun." Now all the foregoing are done seriously and not
    in jest. Therefore derision differs from all of them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS072.html#SSQ72OUTP1"
      >Question [72]</a
    >, <a href="SS072.html#SSQ72A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), sins of word should
    be weighed chiefly by the intention of the speaker, wherefore these sins are
    differentiated according to the various intentions of those who speak
    against another. Now just as the railer intends to injure the honor of the
    person he rails, the backbiter to depreciate a good name, and the
    tale-bearer to destroy friendship, so too the derider intends to shame the
    person he derides. And since this end is distinct from the others, it
    follows that the sin of derision is distinct from the foregoing sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Laughing to scorn and derision agree as
    to the end but differ in mode, because derision is done with the "mouth,"
    i.e. by words and laughter, while laughing to scorn is done by wrinkling the
    nose, as a gloss says on Ps. 2:4, "He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at
    them": and such a distinction does not differentiate the species. Yet they
    both differ from reviling, as being shamed differs from being dishonored:
    for to be ashamed is "to fear dishonor," as Damascene states (De Fide Orth.
    ii, 15).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> For doing a virtuous deed a man deserves
    both respect and a good name in the eyes of others, and in his own eyes the
    glory of a good conscience, according to 2 Cor. 1:12, "Our glory is this,
    the testimony of our conscience." Hence, on the other hand, for doing a
    reprehensible, i.e. a vicious action, a man forfeits his honor and good name
    in the eyes of others---and for this purpose the reviler and the backbiter
    speak of another person---while in his own eyes, he loses the glory of his
    conscience through being confused and ashamed at reprehensible deeds being
    imputed to him---and for this purpose the derider speaks ill of him. It is
    accordingly evident that derision agrees with the foregoing vices as to the
    matter but differs as to the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A secure and calm conscience is a great
    good, according to Prov. 15:15, "A secure mind is like a continual feast."
    Wherefore he that disturbs another's conscience by confounding him inflicts
    a special injury on him: hence derision is a special kind of sin.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether derision can be a mortal sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that derision cannot be a mortal
    sin. Every mortal sin is contrary to charity. But derision does not seem
    contrary to charity, for sometimes it takes place in jest among friends,
    wherefore it is known as "making fun." Therefore derision cannot be a mortal
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the greatest derision would appear to be
    that which is done as an injury to God. But derision is not always a mortal
    sin when it tends to the injury of God: else it would be a mortal sin to
    relapse into a venial sin of which one has repented. For Isidore says (De
    Sum. Bon. ii, 16) that "he who continues to do what he has repented of, is a
    derider and not a penitent." It would likewise follow that all hypocrisy is
    a mortal sin, because, according to Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 15) "the ostrich
    signifies the hypocrite, who derides the horse, i.e. the just man, and his
    rider, i.e. God." Therefore derision is not a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, reviling and backbiting seem to be
    graver sins than derision, because it is more to do a thing seriously than
    in jest. But not all backbiting or reviling is a mortal sin. Much less
    therefore is derision a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++3%3A34"
      >Prov. 3:34</a
    >): "He derideth [Vulg.: 'shall scorn'] the scorners." But God's derision is
    eternal punishment for mortal sin, as appears from the words of Ps. 2:4, "He
    that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them." Therefore derision is a mortal
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The object of derision is always some evil or
    defect. Now when an evil is great, it is taken, not in jest, but seriously:
    consequently if it is taken in jest or turned to ridicule (whence the terms
    'derision' and 'jesting'), this is because it is considered to be slight.
    Now an evil may be considered to be slight in two ways: first, in itself,
    secondly, in relation to the person. When anyone makes game or fun of
    another's evil or defect, because it is a slight evil in itself, this is a
    venial sin by reason of its genus. on the other hand this defect may be
    considered as a slight evil in relation to the person, just as we are wont
    to think little of the defects of children and imbeciles: and then to make
    game or fun of a person, is to scorn him altogether, and to think him so
    despicable that his misfortune troubles us not one whit, but is held as an
    object of derision. In this way derision is a mortal sin, and more grievous
    than reviling, which is also done openly: because the reviler would seem to
    take another's evil seriously; whereas the derider does so in fun, and so
    would seem the more to despise and dishonor the other man. Wherefore, in
    this sense, derision is a grievous sin, and all the more grievous according
    as a greater respect is due to the person derided.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Consequently it is an exceedingly grievous sin to deride God and the things
    of God, according to Is. 37:23, "Whom hast thou reproached, and whom hast
    thou blasphemed, and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice?" and he
    replies: "Against the Holy One of Israel." In the second place comes
    derision of one's parents, wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++30%3A17"
      >Prov. 30:17</a
    >): "The eye that mocketh at his father, and that despiseth the labor of his
    mother in bearing him, let the ravens of the brooks pick it out, and the
    young eagles eat it." Further, the derision of good persons is grievous,
    because honor is the reward of virtue, and against this it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+12%3A4"
      >Job 12:4</a
    >): "The simplicity of the just man is laughed to scorn." Such like derision
    does very much harm: because it turns men away from good deeds, according to
    Gregory (Moral. xx, 14), "Who when they perceive any good points appearing
    in the acts of others, directly pluck them up with the hand of a mischievous
    reviling."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Jesting implies nothing contrary to
    charity in relation to the person with whom one jests, but it may imply
    something against charity in relation to the person who is the object of the
    jest, on account of contempt, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Neither he that relapses into a sin of
    which he has repented, nor a hypocrite, derides God explicitly, but
    implicitly, in so far as either's behavior is like a derider's. Nor is it
    true that to commit a venial sin is to relapse or dissimulate altogether,
    but only dispositively and imperfectly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Derision considered in itself is less
    grievous than backbiting or reviling, because it does not imply contempt,
    but jest. Sometimes however it includes greater contempt than reviling does,
    as stated above, and then it is a grave sin.<br />
