<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider pusillanimity. Under this head there are two points 
of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS133.html#SSQ133A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether pusillanimity is a sin?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that pusillanimity is not a sin. For every sin makes a 
man evil, just as every virtue makes a man good. But a fainthearted man 
is not evil, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 3). Therefore 
pusillanimity is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 3) that "a fainthearted 
man is especially one who is worthy of great goods, yet does not deem 
himself worthy of them." Now no one is worthy of great goods except the 
virtuous, since as the Philosopher again says (Ethic. iv, 3), "none but 
the virtuous are truly worthy of honor." Therefore the fainthearted are 
virtuous: and consequently pusillanimity is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "Pride is the beginning of all sin" (Ecclus. 10:15). But 
pusillanimity does not proceed from pride, since the proud man sets 
himself above what he is, while the fainthearted man withdraws from the 
things he is worthy of. Therefore pusillanimity is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 3) that "he who deems 
himself less worthy than he is, is said to be fainthearted." Now 
sometimes holy men deem themselves less worthy than they are; for 
instance, Moses and Jeremias, who were worthy of the office God chose 
them for, which they both humbly declined (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++3:11;+Jer++1:6">Ex. 3:11; Jer. 1:6</a>). Therefore 
pusillanimity is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Nothing in human conduct is to be avoided save sin. Now 
pusillanimity is to be avoided: for it is written (Col. 3:21): "Fathers, 
provoke not your children to indignation, lest they be discouraged." 
Therefore pusillanimity is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Whatever is contrary to a natural inclination is a sin, 
because it is contrary to a law of nature. Now everything  has a natural 
inclination to accomplish an action that is commensurate with its power: 
as is evident in all natural things, whether animate or inanimate. Now 
just as presumption makes a man exceed what is proportionate to his 
power, by striving to do more than he can, so pusillanimity makes a man 
fall short of what is proportionate to his power, by refusing to tend to 
that which is commensurate thereto. Wherefore as presumption is a sin, so 
is pusillanimity. Hence it is that the servant who buried in the earth 
the money he had received from his master, and did not trade with it 
through fainthearted fear, was punished by his master (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++25;+Lk++19">Mt. 25; Lk. 19</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher calls those evil who injure their neighbor: 
and accordingly the fainthearted is said not to be evil, because he 
injures no one, save accidentally, by omitting to do what might be 
profitable to others. For Gregory says (Pastoral. i) that if "they who 
demur to do good to their neighbor in preaching be judged strictly, 
without doubt their guilt is proportionate to the good they might have 
done had they been less retiring."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Nothing hinders a person who has a virtuous habit from 
sinning venially and without losing the habit, or mortally and with loss 
of the habit of gratuitous virtue. Hence it is possible for a man, by 
reason of the virtue which he has, to be worthy of doing certain great 
things that are worthy of great honor, and yet through not trying to make 
use of his virtue, he sins sometimes venially, sometimes mortally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again it may be replied that the fainthearted is worthy of great things 
in proportion to his ability for virtue, ability which he derives either 
from a good natural disposition, or from science, or from external 
fortune, and if he fails to use those things for virtue, he becomes 
guilty of pusillanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even pusillanimity may in some way be the result of pride: 
when, to wit, a man clings too much to his own opinion, whereby he thinks 
himself incompetent for those things for which he is competent. Hence it 
is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++26:16">Prov. 26:16</a>): "The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than 
seven men that speak sentences." For nothing hinders him from 
depreciating himself in some things, and having a high opinion of himself 
in others. Wherefore Gregory says (Pastoral. i) of Moses that "perchance 
he would have been proud, had he undertaken the leadership of a numerous 
people without misgiving: and again he would have been proud, had he 
refused to obey the command of his Creator."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Moses and Jeremias were worthy of the office to which they 
were appointed by God, but their worthiness was of Divine grace: yet 
they, considering the insufficiency of their own weakness, demurred; 
though not obstinately lest they should fall into pride.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether pusillanimity is opposed to magnanimity? <br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that pusillanimity is not opposed to magnanimity. For 
the Philosopher says (Ethic., 3) that "the fainthearted man knows not 
himself: for he would desire the good things, of which he is worthy, if 
he knew himself." Now ignorance of self seems opposed to prudence. 
Therefore pusillanimity is opposed to prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further our Lord calls the servant wicked and slothful who 
through pusillanimity refused to make use of the money. Moreover the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 3) that the fainthearted seem to be 
slothful. Now sloth is opposed to solicitude, which is an act of 
prudence, as stated above (<A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>). Therefore pusillanimity is not 
opposed to magnanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, pusillanimity seems to proceed from inordinate fear: 
hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++35:4">Is. 35:4</a>): "Say to the fainthearted: Take courage 
and fear not." It also seems to proceed from inordinate anger, according 
to Col. 3:21, "Fathers, provoke not your children to indignation, lest 
they be discouraged." Now inordinate fear is opposed to fortitude, and 
inordinate anger to meekness. Therefore pusillanimity is not opposed to 
magnanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the vice that is in opposition to a particular virtue is 
the more grievous according as it is more unlike that virtue. Now 
pusillanimity is more unlike magnanimity than presumption is. Therefore 
if pusillanimity is opposed to magnanimity, it follows that it is a more 
grievous sin than presumption: yet this is contrary to the saying of 
Ecclus. 37:3, "O wicked presumption, whence camest thou?" Therefore 
pusillanimity is not opposed to magnanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Pusillanimity and magnanimity differ as greatness and 
littleness of soul, as their very names denote. Now great and little are 
opposites. Therefore pusillanimity is opposed to magnanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Pusillanimity may be considered in three ways. First, in 
itself; and thus it is evident that by its very nature it is opposed to 
magnanimity, from which it differs as great and little differ in 
connection with the same subject. For just as the magnanimous man tends 
to great things out of greatness of soul, so the pusillanimous man 
shrinks from great things out of littleness of soul. Secondly, it may be 
considered in reference to its cause, which on the part of the intellect 
is ignorance of one's own qualification, and on the part of the appetite 
is the fear of failure in what one falsely deems to exceed one's ability. 
Thirdly, it may be considered in reference to its effect, which is to 
shrink from the great things of which one is worthy. But, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS132.html#SSQ132OUTP1">Question [132]</a>, <A Href="SS132.html#SSQ132A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3), opposition between vice and virtue depends rather 
on their respective species than on their cause or effect. Hence 
pusillanimity is directly opposed to magnanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument considers pusillanimity as  proceeding from a 
cause in the intellect. Yet it cannot be said properly that it is opposed 
to prudence, even in respect of its cause: because ignorance of this kind 
does not proceed from indiscretion but from laziness in considering one's 
own ability, according to Ethic. iv, 3, or in accomplishing what is 
within one's power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument considers pusillanimity from the point of 
view of its effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers the point of view of cause. Nor is 
the fear that causes pusillanimity always a fear of the dangers of death: 
wherefore it does not follow from this standpoint that pusillanimity is 
opposed to fortitude. As regards anger, if we consider it under the 
aspect of its proper movement, whereby a man is roused to take vengeance, 
it does not cause pusillanimity, which disheartens the soul; on the 
contrary, it takes it away. If, however, we consider the causes of anger, 
which are injuries inflicted whereby the soul of the man who suffers them 
is disheartened, it conduces to pusillanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[133] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> According to its proper species pusillanimity is a graver 
sin than presumption, since thereby a man withdraws from good things, 
which is a very great evil according to Ethic. iv. Presumption, however, 
is stated to be "wicked" on account of pride whence it proceeds.<br>
