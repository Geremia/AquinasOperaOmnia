<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In due sequence we must consider the contrary vices: first, unbelief, 
which is contrary to faith; secondly, blasphemy, which is opposed to 
confession of faith; thirdly, ignorance and dulness of mind, which are 
contrary to knowledge and understanding.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] Out. Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the first, we must consider (1) unbelief in general; (2) heresy; 
(3) apostasy from the faith.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that unbelief is not a sin. For every sin is 
contrary to nature, as Damascene proves (De Fide Orth. ii, 4). Now 
unbelief seems not to be contrary to nature; for Augustine says (De 
Praedest. Sanct. v) that "to be capable to having faith, just as to be 
capable of having charity, is natural to all men; whereas to have faith, 
even as to have charity, belongs to the grace of the  faithful." 
Therefore not to have faith, which is to be an unbeliever, is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one sins that which he cannot avoid, since every sin 
is voluntary. Now it is not in a man's power to avoid unbelief, for he 
cannot avoid it unless he have faith, because the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++10:14">Rm. 10:14</a>): "How shall they believe in Him, of Whom they have not heard? And 
how shall they hear without a preacher?" Therefore unbelief does not seem 
to be a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), there are seven 
capital sins, to which all sins are reduced. But unbelief does not seem 
to be comprised under any of them. Therefore unbelief is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Vice is opposed to virtue. Now faith is a virtue, and 
unbelief is opposed to it. Therefore unbelief is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Unbelief may be taken in two ways: first, by way of pure 
negation, so that a man be called an unbeliever, merely because he has 
not the faith. Secondly, unbelief may be taken by way of opposition to 
the faith; in which sense a man refuses to hear the faith, or despises 
it, according to Is. 53:1: "Who hath believed our report?" It is this 
that completes the notion of unbelief, and it is in this sense that 
unbelief is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, we take it by way of pure negation, as we find it in those 
who have heard nothing about the faith, it bears the character, not of 
sin, but of punishment, because such like ignorance of Divine things is a 
result of the sin of our first parent. If such like unbelievers are 
damned, it is on account of other sins, which cannot be taken away 
without faith, but not on account of their sin of unbelief. Hence Our 
Lord said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++15:22">Jn. 15:22</a>) "If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would 
not have sin"; which Augustine expounds (Tract. lxxxix in Joan.) as 
"referring to the sin whereby they believed not in Christ."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To have the faith is not part of human nature, but it is 
part of human nature that man's mind should not thwart his inner 
instinct, and the outward preaching of the truth. Hence, in this way, 
unbelief is contrary to nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument takes unbelief as denoting a pure negation.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Unbelief, in so far as it is a sin, arises from pride, 
through which man is unwilling to subject his intellect to the rules of 
faith, and to the sound interpretation of the Fathers. Hence Gregory says 
(Moral. xxxi, 45) that "presumptuous innovations arise from vainglory."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It might also be replied that just as the theological virtues are not 
reduced to the cardinal virtues, but precede them, so too, the vices 
opposed to the theological virtues are not reduced to the  capital vices.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether unbelief is in the intellect as its subject?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that unbelief is not in the intellect as its 
subject. For every sin is in the will, according to Augustine (De Duabus 
Anim. x, xi). Now unbelief is a sin, as stated above (<A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore 
unbelief resides in the will and not in the intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, unbelief is sinful through contempt of the preaching of 
the faith. But contempt pertains to the will. Therefore unbelief is in 
the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a gloss [*Augustine, Enchiridion lx.] on 2 Cor. 11:14 
"Satan . . . transformeth himself into an angel of light," says that if 
"a wicked angel pretend to be a good angel, and be taken for a good 
angel, it is not a dangerous or an unhealthy error, if he does or says 
what is becoming to a good angel." This seems to be because of the 
rectitude of the will of the man who adheres to the angel, since his 
intention is to adhere to a good angel. Therefore the sin of unbelief 
seems to consist entirely in a perverse will: and, consequently, it does 
not reside in the intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Things which are contrary to one another are in the 
same subject. Now faith, to which unbelief is opposed, resides in the 
intellect. Therefore unbelief also is in the intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS074.html#FSQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS074.html#FSQ74ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), sin is said to be 
in the power which is the principle of the sinful act. Now a sinful act 
may have two principles: one is its first and universal principle, which 
commands all acts of sin; and this is the will, because every sin is 
voluntary. The other principle of the sinful act is the proper and 
proximate principle which elicits the sinful act: thus the concupiscible 
is the principle of gluttony and lust, wherefore these sins are said to 
be in the concupiscible. Now dissent, which is the act proper to 
unbelief, is an act of the intellect, moved, however, by the will, just 
as assent is.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore unbelief, like faith, is in the intellect as its proximate 
subject. But it is in the will as its first moving principle, in which 
way every sin is said to be in the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the Reply to the First Objection is clear.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The will's contempt causes the intellect's dissent, which 
completes the notion of unbelief. Hence the cause of unbelief is in the 
will, while unbelief itself is in the intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He that believes a wicked angel to be a good one, does not 
dissent from a matter of faith, because "his bodily senses  are deceived, 
while his mind does not depart from a true and right judgment" as the 
gloss observes [*Augustine, Enchiridion lx]. But, according to the same 
authority, to adhere to Satan when he begins to invite one to his abode, 
i.e. wickedness and error, is not without sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether unbelief is the greatest of sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that unbelief is not the greatest of sins. For 
Augustine says (De Bapt. contra Donat. iv, 20): "I should hesitate to 
decide whether a very wicked Catholic ought to be preferred to a heretic, 
in whose life one finds nothing reprehensible beyond the fact that he is 
a heretic." But a heretic is an unbeliever. Therefore we ought not to say 
absolutely that unbelief is the greatest of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which diminishes or excuses a sin is not, 
seemingly, the greatest of sins. Now unbelief excuses or diminishes sin: 
for the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Tim++1:12,13">1 Tim. 1:12,13</a>): "I . . . before was a blasphemer, 
and a persecutor and contumelious; but I obtained . . . mercy . . . 
because I did it ignorantly in unbelief." Therefore unbelief is not the 
greatest of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the greater sin deserves the greater punishment, 
according to Dt. 25:2: "According to the measure of the sin shall the 
measure also of the stripes be." Now a greater punishment is due to 
believers than to unbelievers, according to Heb. 10:29: "How much more, 
do you think, he deserveth worse punishments, who hath trodden under foot 
the Son of God, and hath esteemed the blood of the testament unclean, by 
which he was sanctified?" Therefore unbelief is not the greatest of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine, commenting on Jn. 15:22, "If I had not come, 
and spoken to them, they would not have sin," says (Tract. lxxxix in 
Joan.): "Under the general name, He refers to a singularly great sin. For 
this," viz. infidelity, "is the sin to which all others may be traced." 
Therefore unbelief is the greatest of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Every sin consists formally in aversion from God, as 
stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS071.html#FSQ71OUTP1">Question [71]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS071.html#FSQ71A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Hence the more a sin 
severs man from God, the graver it is. Now man is more than ever 
separated from God by unbelief, because he has not even true knowledge of 
God: and by false knowledge of God, man does not approach Him, but is 
severed from Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor is it possible for one who has a false opinion of God, to know Him 
in any way at all, because the object of his opinion is not God. 
Therefore it is clear that the sin of unbelief is greater than any sin 
that occurs in the perversion of morals. This does not apply to the sins 
that are opposed to the theological virtues, as we shall stated further 
on (<A Href="SS020.html#SSQ20OUTP1">Question [20]</a>, <A Href="SS020.html#SSQ20A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS034.html#SSQ34OUTP1">Question [34]</a>, <A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS034.html#SSQ34A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2; <A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS039.html#SSQ39OUTP1">Question [39]</a>, <A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS039.html#SSQ39A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Nothing hinders a sin that is more grave in its genus from 
being less grave in respect of some circumstances. Hence Augustine 
hesitated to decide between a bad Catholic, and a heretic not sinning 
otherwise, because although the heretic's sin is more grave generically, 
it can be lessened by a circumstance, and conversely the sin of the 
Catholic can, by some circumstance, be aggravated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Unbelief includes both ignorance, as an accessory thereto, 
and resistance to matters of faith, and in the latter respect it is a 
most grave sin. In respect, however, of this ignorance, it has a certain 
reason for excuse, especially when a man sins not from malice, as was the 
case with the Apostle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> An unbeliever is more severely punished for his sin of 
unbelief than another sinner is for any sin whatever, if we consider the 
kind of sin. But in the case of another sin, e.g. adultery, committed by 
a believer, and by an unbeliever, the believer, other things being equal, 
sins more gravely than the unbeliever, both on account of his knowledge 
of the truth through faith, and on account of the sacraments of faith 
with which he has been satiated, and which he insults by committing sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether every act of an unbeliever is a sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that each act of an unbeliever is a sin. Because a 
gloss on Rm. 14:23, "All that is not of faith is sin," says: "The whole 
life of unbelievers is a sin." Now the life of unbelievers consists of 
their actions. Therefore every action of an unbeliever is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, faith directs the intention. Now there can be no good 
save what comes from a right intention. Therefore, among unbelievers, no 
action can be good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, when that which precedes is corrupted, that which 
follows is corrupted also. Now an act of faith precedes the acts of all 
the virtues. Therefore, since there is no act of faith in unbelievers, 
they can do no good work, but sin in every action of theirs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said of Cornelius, while yet an unbeliever (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Acts+10:4,31">Acts 10:4,31</a>), that his alms were acceptable to God. Therefore not every 
action of an unbeliever is a sin, but some of his actions are good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS085.html#FSQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS085.html#FSQ85ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4) mortal sin takes 
away sanctifying grace, but does not wholly corrupt the good of nature. 
Since therefore, unbelief is a mortal sin, unbelievers are without grace 
indeed, yet some good of nature remains in them. Consequently it is 
evident that unbelievers cannot do those good works which proceed from 
grace, viz. meritorious works; yet they can, to a certain extent, do 
those good works for which the good of  nature suffices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence it does not follow that they sin in everything they do; but 
whenever they do anything out of their unbelief, then they sin. For even 
as one who has the faith, can commit an actual sin, venial or even 
mortal, which he does not refer to the end of faith, so too, an 
unbeliever can do a good deed in a matter which he does not refer to the 
end of his unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The words quoted must be taken to mean either that the life 
of unbelievers cannot be sinless, since without faith no sin is taken 
away, or that whatever they do out of unbelief, is a sin. Hence the same

unbelief, sins grievously."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Faith directs the intention with regard to the supernatural 
last end: but even the light of natural reason can direct the intention 
in respect of a connatural good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Unbelief does not so wholly destroy natural reason in 
unbelievers, but that some knowledge of the truth remains in them, 
whereby they are able to do deeds that are generically good. With regard, 
however, to Cornelius, it is to be observed that he was not an 
unbeliever, else his works would not have been acceptable to God, whom 
none can please without faith. Now he had implicit faith, as the truth of 
the Gospel was not yet made manifest: hence Peter was sent to him to give 
him fuller instruction in the faith.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are not several species of unbelief. 
For, since faith and unbelief are contrary to one another, they must be 
about the same thing. Now the formal object of faith is the First Truth, 
whence it derives its unity, although its matter contains many points of 
belief. Therefore the object of unbelief also is the First Truth; while 
the things which an unbeliever disbelieves are the matter of his 
unbelief. Now the specific difference depends not on material but on 
formal principles. Therefore there are not several species of unbelief, 
according to the various points which the unbeliever disbelieves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is possible to stray from the truth of faith in an 
infinite number of ways. If therefore the various species of unbelief 
correspond to the number of various errors, it would seem to follow that 
there is an infinite number of species of unbelief, and consequently, 
that we ought not to make these species the object of our consideration.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same thing does not belong to different species. Now 
a man may be an unbeliever through erring about different points of 
truth. Therefore diversity of errors does not make a diversity of species 
of unbelief: and so there are not  several species of unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Several species of vice are opposed to each virtue, 
because "good happens in one way, but evil in many ways," according to 
Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv) and the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 6). Now faith is 
a virtue. Therefore several species of vice are opposed to it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[5] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS064.html#FSQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS064.html#FSQ64A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), every 
virtue consists in following some rule of human knowledge or operation. 
Now conformity to a rule happens one way in one matter, whereas a breach 
of the rule happens in many ways, so that many vices are opposed to one 
virtue. The diversity of the vices that are opposed to each virtue may be 
considered in two ways, first, with regard to their different relations 
to the virtue: and in this way there are determinate species of vices 
contrary to a virtue: thus to a moral virtue one vice is opposed by 
exceeding the virtue, and another, by falling short of the virtue. 
Secondly, the diversity of vices opposed to one virtue may be considered 
in respect of the corruption of the various conditions required for that 
virtue. In this way an infinite number of vices are opposed to one 
virtue, e.g. temperance or fortitude, according to the infinite number of 
ways in which the various circumstances of a virtue may be corrupted, so 
that the rectitude of virtue is forsaken. For this reason the 
Pythagoreans held evil to be infinite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[5] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly we must say that if unbelief be considered in comparison to 
faith, there are several species of unbelief, determinate in number. For, 
since the sin of unbelief consists in resisting the faith, this may 
happen in two ways: either the faith is resisted before it has been 
accepted, and such is the unbelief of pagans or heathens; or the 
Christian faith is resisted after it has been accepted, and this either 
in the figure, and such is the unbelief of the Jews, or in the very 
manifestation of truth, and such is the unbelief of heretics. Hence we 
may, in a general way, reckon these three as species of unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[5] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, the species of unbelief be distinguished according to the 
various errors that occur in matters of faith, there are not determinate 
species of unbelief: for errors can be multiplied indefinitely, as 
Augustine observes (De Haeresibus).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The formal aspect of a sin can be considered in two ways. 
First, according to the intention of the sinner, in which case the thing 
to which the sinner turns is the formal object of his sin, and determines 
the various species of that sin. Secondly, it may be considered as an 
evil, and in this case the good which is forsaken is the formal object of 
the sin; which however does not derive its species from this point of 
view, in fact it is a privation. We must therefore reply that the object 
of unbelief is the First Truth considered as that which unbelief 
forsakes, but its formal aspect, considered as that to which unbelief 
turns, is the false opinion that it follows: and it is from this point of 
view that unbelief derives its various species. Hence, even as charity  
is one, because it adheres to the Sovereign Good, while there are various 
species of vice opposed to charity, which turn away from the Sovereign 
Good by turning to various temporal goods, and also in respect of various 
inordinate relations to God, so too, faith is one virtue through adhering 
to the one First Truth, yet there are many species of unbelief, because 
unbelievers follow many false opinions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument considers the various species of unbelief 
according to various points in which errors occur.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since faith is one because it believes in many things in 
relation to one, so may unbelief, although it errs in many things, be one 
in so far as all those things are related to one. Yet nothing hinders one 
man from erring in various species of unbelief, even as one man may be 
subject to various vices, and to various bodily diseases.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the unbelief of pagans or heathens is graver than other kinds?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the unbelief of heathens or pagans is graver 
than other kinds. For just as bodily disease is graver according as it 
endangers the health of a more important member of the body, so does sin 
appear to be graver, according as it is opposed to that which holds a 
more important place in virtue. Now that which is most important in 
faith, is belief in the unity of God, from which the heathens deviate by 
believing in many gods. Therefore their unbelief is the gravest of all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, among heresies, the more detestable are those which 
contradict the truth of faith in more numerous and more important points: 
thus, the heresy of Arius, who severed the Godhead, was more detestable 
than that of Nestorius who severed the humanity of Christ from the Person 
of God the Son. Now the heathens deny the faith in more numerous and more 
important points than Jews and heretics; since they do not accept the 
faith at all. Therefore their unbelief is the gravest.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every good diminishes evil. Now there is some good in 
the Jews, since they believe in the Old Testament as being from God, and 
there is some good in heretics, since they venerate the New Testament. 
Therefore they sin less grievously than heathens, who receive neither 
Testament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Pt++2:21">2 Pt. 2:21</a>): "It had been better for 
them not to have known the way of justice, than after they have known it, 
to turn back." Now the heathens have not known the way of justice, 
whereas heretics and Jews have abandoned it after knowing it in some way. 
Therefore theirs is the graver sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[6] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), two things may be considered in 
unbelief. One of these is its relation to faith: and  from this point of 
view, he who resists the faith after accepting it, sins more grievously 
against faith, than he who resists it without having accepted it, even as 
he who fails to fulfil what he has promised, sins more grievously than if 
he had never promised it. In this way the unbelief of heretics, who 
confess their belief in the Gospel, and resist that faith by corrupting 
it, is a more grievous sin than that of the Jews, who have never accepted 
the Gospel faith. Since, however, they accepted the figure of that faith 
in the Old Law, which they corrupt by their false interpretations, their 
unbelief is a more grievous sin than that of the heathens, because the 
latter have not accepted the Gospel faith in any way at all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[6] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thing to be considered in unbelief is the corruption of 
matters of faith. In this respect, since heathens err on more points than 
Jews, and these in more points than heretics, the unbelief of heathens is 
more grievous than the unbelief of the Jews, and that of the Jews than 
that of the heretics, except in such cases as that of the Manichees, who, 
in matters of faith, err even more than heathens do.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[6] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of these two gravities the first surpasses the second from the point of 
view of guilt; since, as stated above (<A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) unbelief has the character 
of guilt, from its resisting faith rather than from the mere absence of 
faith, for the latter as was stated (<A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) seems rather to bear the 
character of punishment. Hence, speaking absolutely, the unbelief of 
heretics is the worst.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[6] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one ought not to dispute with unbelievers in 
public. For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Tim++2:14">2 Tim. 2:14</a>): "Contend not in words, for it 
is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers." But it is 
impossible to dispute with unbelievers publicly without contending in 
words. Therefore one ought not to dispute publicly with unbelievers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the law of Martianus Augustus confirmed by the canons 
[*De Sum. Trin. Cod. lib. i, leg. Nemo] expresses itself thus: "It is an 
insult to the judgment of the most religious synod, if anyone ventures to 
debate or dispute in public about matters which have once been judged and 
disposed of." Now all matters of faith have been decided by the holy 
councils. Therefore it is an insult to the councils, and consequently a 
grave sin to presume to dispute in public about matters of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, disputations are conducted by means of arguments. But an 
argument is a reason in settlement of a dubious matter: whereas things 
that are of faith, being most certain, ought not to be a matter of doubt. 
Therefore one ought not to dispute in public about matters of faith. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Acts+9:22,29">Acts 9:22,29</a>) that "Saul increased much 
more in strength, and confounded the Jews," and that "he spoke . . . to 
the gentiles and disputed with the Greeks."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[7] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In disputing about the faith, two things must be 
observed: one on the part of the disputant; the other on the part of his 
hearers. On the part of the disputant, we must consider his intention. 
For if he were to dispute as though he had doubts about the faith, and 
did not hold the truth of faith for certain, and as though he intended to 
probe it with arguments, without doubt he would sin, as being doubtful of 
the faith and an unbeliever. On the other hand, it is praiseworthy to 
dispute about the faith in order to confute errors, or for practice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[7] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the part of the hearers we must consider whether those who hear the 
disputation are instructed and firm in the faith, or simple and wavering. 
As to those who are well instructed and firm in the faith, there can be 
no danger in disputing about the faith in their presence. But as to 
simple-minded people, we must make a distinction; because either they are 
provoked and molested by unbelievers, for instance, Jews or heretics, or 
pagans who strive to corrupt the faith in them, or else they are not 
subject to provocation in this matter, as in those countries where there 
are not unbelievers. In the first case it is necessary to dispute in 
public about the faith, provided there be those who are equal and adapted 
to the task of confuting errors; since in this way simple people are 
strengthened in the faith, and unbelievers are deprived of the 
opportunity to deceive, while if those who ought to withstand the 
perverters of the truth of faith were silent, this would tend to 
strengthen error. Hence Gregory says (Pastor. ii, 4): "Even as a 
thoughtless speech gives rise to error, so does an indiscreet silence 
leave those in error who might have been instructed." On the other hand, 
in the second case it is dangerous to dispute in public about the faith, 
in the presence of simple people, whose faith for this very reason is 
more firm, that they have never heard anything differing from what they 
believe. Hence it is not expedient for them to hear what unbelievers have 
to say against the faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle does not entirely forbid disputations, but such 
as are inordinate, and consist of contentious words rather than of sound 
speeches.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That law forbade those public disputations about the faith, 
which arise from doubting the faith, but not those which are for the 
safeguarding thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> One ought to dispute about matters of faith, not as though 
one doubted about them, but in order to make the truth known, and to 
confute errors. For, in order to confirm the faith, it is necessary 
sometimes to dispute with unbelievers, sometimes by defending the faith, 
according to 1 Pt. 3:15: "Being ready always to satisfy everyone that 
asketh you a reason of that hope and faith  which is in you [*Vulg.: 'Of 
that hope which is in you' St. Thomas' reading is apparently taken from 
Bede]." Sometimes again, it is necessary, in order to convince those who 
are in error, according to Titus 1:9: "That he may be able to exhort in 
sound doctrine and to convince the gainsayers."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether unbelievers ought to be compelled to the faith?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that unbelievers ought by no means to be compelled 
to the faith. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++13:28">Mt. 13:28</a>) that the servants of the 
householder, in whose field cockle had been sown, asked him: "Wilt thou 
that we go and gather it up?" and that he answered: "No, lest perhaps 
gathering up the cockle, you root up the wheat also together with it": on 
which passage Chrysostom says (Hom. xlvi in Matth.): "Our Lord says this 
so as to forbid the slaying of men. For it is not right to slay heretics, 
because if you do you will necessarily slay many innocent persons." 
Therefore it seems that for the same reason unbelievers ought not to be 
compelled to the faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we read in the Decretals (Dist. xlv can., De Judaeis): 
"The holy synod prescribes, with regard to the Jews, that for the future, 
none are to be compelled to believe." Therefore, in like manner, neither 
should unbelievers be compelled to the faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.) that "it is 
possible for a man to do other things against his will, but he cannot 
believe unless he is willing." Therefore it seems that unbelievers ought 
not to be compelled to the faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[8] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> It is said in God's person (Ezech. 18:32 [*Ezech. 33:11]): "I 
desire not the death of the sinner [Vulg.: 'of him that dieth']." Now we 
ought to conform our will to the Divine will, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS019.html#FSQ19ATHEP1">Articles [9]</a>,10). Therefore we should not even wish unbelievers to be put to 
death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++14:23">Lk. 14:23</a>): "Go out into the highways 
and hedges; and compel them to come in." Now men enter into the house of 
God, i.e. into Holy Church, by faith. Therefore some ought to be 
compelled to the faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[8] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Among unbelievers there are some who have never received 
the faith, such as the heathens and the Jews: and these are by no means 
to be compelled to the faith, in order that they may believe, because to 
believe depends on the will: nevertheless they should be compelled by the 
faithful, if it be possible to do so, so that they do not hinder the 
faith, by their blasphemies, or by their evil persuasions, or even by 
their open persecutions. It is for this reason that Christ's faithful 
often wage war with unbelievers, not indeed for the purpose of forcing 
them to believe, because even if they were to conquer them, and take them 
prisoners, they should still leave them free to believe, if they will, 
but in order to prevent them from hindering the faith of Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[8] Body Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, there are unbelievers who at some time have accepted 
the faith, and professed it, such as heretics and all apostates: such 
should be submitted even to bodily compulsion, that they may fulfil what 
they have promised, and hold what they, at one time, received.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some have understood the authority quoted to forbid, not 
the excommunication but the slaying of heretics, as appears from the 
words of Chrysostom. Augustine too, says (Ep. ad Vincent. xciii) of 
himself: "It was once my opinion that none should be compelled to union 
with Christ, that we should deal in words, and fight with arguments. 
However this opinion of mine is undone, not by words of contradiction, 
but by convincing examples. Because fear of the law was so profitable, 
that many say: Thanks be to the Lord Who has broken our chains asunder." 
Accordingly the meaning of Our Lord's words, "Suffer both to grow until 
the harvest," must be gathered from those which precede, "lest perhaps 
gathering up the cockle, you root the wheat also together with it." For, 
Augustine says (Contra Ep. Parmen. iii, 2) "these words show that when 
this is not to be feared, that is to say, when a man's crime is so 
publicly known, and so hateful to all, that he has no defenders, or none 
such as might cause a schism, the severity of discipline should not

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those Jews who have in no way received the faith, ought not 
by no means to be compelled to the faith: if, however, they have received 
it, they ought to be compelled to keep it, as is stated in the same 
chapter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as taking a vow is a matter of will, and keeping a 
vow, a matter of obligation, so acceptance of the faith is a matter of 
the will, whereas keeping the faith, when once one has received it, is a 
matter of obligation. Wherefore heretics should be compelled to keep the 
faith. Thus Augustine says to the Count Boniface (Ep. clxxxv): "What do 
these people mean by crying out continually: 'We may believe or not 
believe just as we choose. Whom did Christ compel?' They should remember 
that Christ at first compelled Paul and afterwards taught Him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[8] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Augustine says in the same letter, "none of us wishes 
any heretic to perish. But the house of David did not deserve to have 
peace, unless his son Absalom had been killed in the war which he had 
raised against his father. Thus if the Catholic Church gathers together 
some of the perdition of others, she heals the sorrow of her maternal 
heart by the delivery of so many nations."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is lawful to communicate with unbelievers?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is lawful to communicate with unbelievers. 
For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++10:27">1 Cor. 10:27</a>): "If any of them that believe not, 
invite you, and you be willing to go, eat of anything that is set before 
you." And Chrysostom says (Hom. xxv  super Epist. ad Heb.): "If you wish 
to go to dine with pagans, we permit it without any reservation." Now to 
sit at table with anyone is to communicate with him. Therefore it is 
lawful to communicate with unbelievers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++5:12">1 Cor. 5:12</a>): "What have I to do to 
judge them that are without?" Now unbelievers are without. When, 
therefore, the Church forbids the faithful to communicate with certain 
people, it seems that they ought not to be forbidden to communicate with 
unbelievers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a master cannot employ his servant, unless he 
communicate with him, at least by word, since the master moves his 
servant by command. Now Christians can have unbelievers, either Jews, or 
pagans, or Saracens, for servants. Therefore they can lawfully 
communicate with them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++7:2,3">Dt. 7:2,3</a>): "Thou shalt make no league 
with them, nor show mercy to them; neither shalt thou make marriages with 
them": and a gloss on Lev. 15:19, "The woman who at the return of the 
month," etc. says: "It is so necessary to shun idolatry, that we should 
not come in touch with idolaters or their disciples, nor have any 
dealings with them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[9] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Communication with a particular person is forbidden to 
the faithful, in two ways: first, as a punishment of the person with whom 
they are forbidden to communicate; secondly, for the safety of those who 
are forbidden to communicate with others. Both motives can be gathered 
from the Apostle's words (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++5:6">1 Cor. 5:6</a>). For after he had pronounced 
sentence of excommunication, he adds as his reason: "Know you not that a 
little leaven corrupts the whole lump?" and afterwards he adds the reason 
on the part of the punishment inflicted by the sentence of the Church 
when he says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++5:12">1 Cor. 5:12</a>): "Do not you judge them that are within?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[9] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, in the first way the Church does not forbid the faithful to 
communicate with unbelievers, who have not in any way received the 
Christian faith, viz. with pagans and Jews, because she has not the right 
to exercise spiritual judgment over them, but only temporal judgment, in 
the case when, while dwelling among Christians they are guilty of some 
misdemeanor, and are condemned by the faithful to some temporal 
punishment. On the other hand, in this way, i.e. as a punishment, the 
Church forbids the faithful to communicate with those unbelievers who 
have forsaken the faith they once received, either by corrupting the 
faith, as heretics, or by entirely renouncing the faith, as apostates, 
because the Church pronounces sentence of excommunication on both.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[9] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the second way, it seems that one ought to distinguish 
according to the various conditions of persons, circumstances and time. 
For some are firm in the faith; and so it is to be hoped that their 
communicating with unbelievers will lead to the conversion of the latter 
rather than to the aversion of the faithful from the faith. These are not 
to be forbidden to  communicate with unbelievers who have not received 
the faith, such as pagans or Jews, especially if there be some urgent 
necessity for so doing. But in the case of simple people and those who 
are weak in the faith, whose perversion is to be feared as a probable 
result, they should be forbidden to communicate with unbelievers, and 
especially to be on very familiar terms with them, or to communicate with 
them without necessity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[9] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Church does not exercise judgment against unbelievers 
in the point of inflicting spiritual punishment on them: but she does 
exercise judgment over some of them in the matter of temporal punishment. 
It is under this head that sometimes the Church, for certain special 
sins, withdraws the faithful from communication with certain unbelievers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There is more probability that a servant who is ruled by 
his master's commands, will be converted to the faith of his master who 
is a believer, than if the case were the reverse: and so the faithful are 
not forbidden to have unbelieving servants. If, however, the master were 
in danger, through communicating with such a servant, he should send him 
away, according to Our Lord's command (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++18:8">Mt. 18:8</a>): "If . . . thy foot 
scandalize thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the argument in the contrary [*The Leonine Edition gives 
this solution before the Reply OBJ 2] sense the reply is that the Lord 
gave this command in reference to those nations into whose territory the 
Jews were about to enter. For the latter were inclined to idolatry, so 
that it was to be feared lest, through frequent dealings with those 
nations, they should be estranged from the faith: hence the text goes on 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++7:4">Dt. 7:4</a>): "For she will turn away thy son from following Me."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether unbelievers may have authority or dominion over the faithful?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that unbelievers may have authority or dominion 
over the faithful. For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Tim++6:1">1 Tim. 6:1</a>): "Whosoever are 
servants under the yoke, let them count their masters worthy of all 
honor": and it is clear that he is speaking of unbelievers, since he adds 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Tim++6:2">1 Tim. 6:2</a>): "But they that have believing masters, let them not despise 
them." Moreover it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Pt++2:18">1 Pt. 2:18</a>): "Servants be subject to your 
masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the 
froward." Now this command would not be contained in the apostolic 
teaching unless unbelievers could have authority over the faithful. 
Therefore it seems that unbelievers can have authority over the faithful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, all the members of a prince's household are his 
subjects. Now some of the faithful were members of unbelieving  princes' 
households, for we read in the Epistle to the Philippians (4:22): "All 
the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesar's household," 
referring to Nero, who was an unbeliever. Therefore unbelievers can have 
authority over the faithful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Polit. i, 2) a slave is 
his master's instrument in matters concerning everyday life, even as a 
craftsman's laborer is his instrument in matters concerning the working 
of his art. Now, in such matters, a believer can be subject to an 
unbeliever, for he may work on an unbeliever's farm. Therefore 
unbelievers may have authority over the faithful even as to dominion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Those who are in authority can pronounce judgment on 
those over whom they are placed. But unbelievers cannot pronounce 
judgment on the faithful, for the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++6:1">1 Cor. 6:1</a>): "Dare any of 
you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust," 
i.e. unbelievers, "and not before the saints?" Therefore it seems that 
unbelievers cannot have authority over the faithful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[10] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> That this question may be considered in two ways. First, 
we may speak of dominion or authority of unbelievers over the faithful as 
of a thing to be established for the first time. This ought by no means 
to be allowed, since it would provoke scandal and endanger the faith, for 
subjects are easily influenced by their superiors to comply with their 
commands, unless the subjects are of great virtue: moreover unbelievers 
hold the faith in contempt, if they see the faithful fall away. Hence the 
Apostle forbade the faithful to go to law before an unbelieving judge. 
And so the Church altogether forbids unbelievers to acquire dominion over 
believers, or to have authority over them in any capacity whatever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[10] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we may speak of dominion or authority, as already in force: 
and here we must observe that dominion and authority are institutions of 
human law, while the distinction between faithful and unbelievers arises 
from the Divine law. Now the Divine law which is the law of grace, does 
not do away with human law which is the law of natural reason. Wherefore 
the distinction between faithful and unbelievers, considered in itself, 
does not do away with dominion and authority of unbelievers over the 
faithful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[10] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless this right of dominion or authority can be justly done away 
with by the sentence or ordination of the Church who has the authority of 
God: since unbelievers in virtue of their unbelief deserve to forfeit 
their power over the faithful who are converted into children of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[10] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This the Church does sometimes, and sometimes not. For among those 
unbelievers who are subject, even in temporal matters, to the Church and 
her members, the Church made the law that if the slave of a Jew became a 
Christian, he should forthwith receive his freedom, without paying any 
price, if he should be a "vernaculus,"  i.e. born in slavery; and 
likewise if, when yet an unbeliever, he had been bought for his service: 
if, however, he had been bought for sale, then he should be offered for 
sale within three months. Nor does the Church harm them in this, because 
since those Jews themselves are subject to the Church, she can dispose of 
their possessions, even as secular princes have enacted many laws to be 
observed by their subjects, in favor of liberty. On the other hand, the 
Church has not applied the above law to those unbelievers who are not 
subject to her or her members, in temporal matters, although she has the 
right to do so: and this, in order to avoid scandal, for as Our Lord 
showed (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++17:25,26">Mt. 17:25,26</a>) that He could be excused from paying the tribute, 
because "the children are free," yet He ordered the tribute to be paid in 
order to avoid giving scandal. Thus Paul too, after saying that servants 
should honor their masters, adds, "lest the name of the Lord and His 
doctrine be blasphemed."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[10] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The authority of Caesar preceded the distinction of 
faithful from unbelievers. Hence it was not cancelled by the conversion 
of some to the faith. Moreover it was a good thing that there should be a 
few of the faithful in the emperor's household, that they might defend 
the rest of the faithful. Thus the Blessed Sebastian encouraged those 
whom he saw faltering under torture, and, the while, remained hidden 
under the military cloak in the palace of Diocletian.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[10] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Slaves are subject to their masters for their whole 
lifetime, and are subject to their overseers in everything: whereas the 
craftsman's laborer is subject to him for certain special works. Hence it 
would be more dangerous for unbelievers to have dominion or authority 
over the faithful, than that they should be allowed to employ them in 
some craft. Wherefore the Church permits Christians to work on the land 
of Jews, because this does not entail their living together with them. 
Thus Solomon besought the King of Tyre to send master workmen to hew the 
trees, as related in 3 Kgs. 5:6. Yet, if there be reason to fear that the 
faithful will be perverted by such communications and dealings, they 
should be absolutely forbidden.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the rites of unbelievers ought to be tolerated?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[11] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that rites of unbelievers ought not to be 
tolerated. For it is evident that unbelievers sin in observing their 
rites: and not to prevent a sin, when one can, seems to imply consent 
therein, as a gloss observes on Rm. 1:32: "Not only they that do them, 
but they also that consent to them that do them." Therefore it is a sin 
to tolerate their rites.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[11] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the rites of the Jews are compared to idolatry, because 
a gloss on Gal. 5:1, "Be not held again under the yoke of bondage," says: 
"The bondage of that law was not lighter  than that of idolatry." But it 
would not be allowable for anyone to observe the rites of idolatry, in 
fact Christian princes at first caused the temples of idols to be closed, 
and afterwards, to be destroyed, as Augustine relates (De Civ. Dei xviii, 
54). Therefore it follows that even the rites of Jews ought not to be 
tolerated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[11] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, unbelief is the greatest of sins, as stated above (<A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Now other sins such as adultery, theft and the like, are not 
tolerated, but are punishable by law. Therefore neither ought the rites 
of unbelievers to be tolerated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[11] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory [*Regist. xi, Ep. 15: cf. Decret., dist. xlv, 
can., Qui sincera] says, speaking of the Jews: "They should be allowed to 
observe all their feasts, just as hitherto they and their fathers have 
for ages observed them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[11] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Human government is derived from the Divine government, 
and should imitate it. Now although God is all-powerful and supremely 
good, nevertheless He allows certain evils to take place in the universe, 
which He might prevent, lest, without them, greater goods might be 
forfeited, or greater evils ensue. Accordingly in human government also, 
those who are in authority, rightly tolerate certain evils, lest certain 
goods be lost, or certain greater evils be incurred: thus Augustine says 
(De Ordine ii, 4): "If you do away with harlots, the world will be 
convulsed with lust." Hence, though unbelievers sin in their rites, they 
may be tolerated, either on account of some good that ensues therefrom, 
or because of some evil avoided. Thus from the fact that the Jews observe 
their rites, which, of old, foreshadowed the truth of the faith which we 
hold, there follows this good---that our very enemies bear witness to our 
faith, and that our faith is represented in a figure, so to speak. For 
this reason they are tolerated in the observance of their rites.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[11] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the rites of other unbelievers, which are neither 
truthful nor profitable are by no means to be tolerated, except perchance 
in order to avoid an evil, e.g. the scandal or disturbance that might 
ensue, or some hindrance to the salvation of those who if they were 
unmolested might gradually be converted to the faith. For this reason the 
Church, at times, has tolerated the rites even of heretics and pagans, 
when unbelievers were very numerous.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the children of Jews and of other unbelievers 
ought to be baptized against their parents' will. For the bond of 
marriage is stronger than the right of parental authority over children, 
since the right of parental authority can be made to cease, when a son is 
set at liberty; whereas the  marriage bond cannot be severed by man, 
according to Mt. 19:6: "What . . . God hath joined together let no man 
put asunder." And yet the marriage bond is broken on account of unbelief: 
for the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++7:15">1 Cor. 7:15</a>): "If the unbeliever depart, let him 
depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases": 
and a canon [*Can. Uxor legitima, and Idololatria, qu. i] says that "if 
the unbelieving partner is unwilling to abide with the other, without 
insult to their Creator, then the other partner is not bound to 
cohabitation." Much more, therefore, does unbelief abrogate the right of 
unbelieving parents' authority over their children: and consequently 
their children may be baptized against their parents' will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one is more bound to succor a man who is in danger of 
everlasting death, than one who is in danger of temporal death. Now it 
would be a sin, if one saw a man in danger of temporal death and failed 
to go to his aid. Since, then, the children of Jews and other unbelievers 
are in danger of everlasting death, should they be left to their parents 
who would imbue them with their unbelief, it seems that they ought to be 
taken away from them and baptized, and instructed in the faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the children of a bondsman are themselves bondsmen, and 
under the power of his master. Now the Jews are bondsmen of kings and 
princes: therefore their children are also. Consequently kings and 
princes have the power to do what they will with Jewish children. 
Therefore no injustice is committed if they baptize them against their 
parents' wishes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, every man belongs more to God, from Whom he has his 
soul, than to his carnal father, from whom he has his body. Therefore it 
is not unjust if Jewish children be taken away from their parents, and 
consecrated to God in Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Baptism avails for salvation more than preaching does, 
since Baptism removes forthwith the stain of sin and the debt of 
punishment, and opens the gate of heaven. Now if danger ensue through not 
preaching, it is imputed to him who omitted to preach, according to the 
words of Ezech. 33:6 about the man who "sees the sword coming and sounds 
not the trumpet." Much more therefore, if Jewish children are lost 
through not being baptized are they accounted guilty of sin, who could 
have baptized them and did not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Injustice should be done to no man. Now it would be an 
injustice to Jews if their children were to be baptized against their 
will, since they would lose the rights of parental authority over their 
children as soon as these were Christians. Therefore these should not be 
baptized against their parents' will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The custom of the Church has very great authority and 
ought to be jealously observed in all things, since the very doctrine of 
catholic doctors derives its authority from the Church. Hence we ought to 
abide by the authority of the Church  rather than by that of an Augustine 
or a Jerome or of any doctor whatever. Now it was never the custom of the 
Church to baptize the children of the Jews against the will of their 
parents, although at times past there have been many very powerful 
catholic princes like Constantine and Theodosius, with whom most holy 
bishops have been on most friendly terms, as Sylvester with Constantine, 
and Ambrose with Theodosius, who would certainly not have failed to 
obtain this favor from them if it had been at all reasonable. It seems 
therefore hazardous to repeat this assertion, that the children of Jews 
should be baptized against their parents' wishes, in contradiction to the 
Church's custom observed hitherto.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two reasons for this custom. One is on account of the danger 
to the faith. For children baptized before coming to the use of reason, 
afterwards when they come to perfect age, might easily be persuaded by 
their parents to renounce what they had unknowingly embraced; and this 
would be detrimental to the faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other reason is that it is against natural justice. For a child is 
by nature part of its father: thus, at first, it is not distinct from its 
parents as to its body, so long as it is enfolded within its mother's 
womb; and later on after birth, and before it has the use of its 
free-will, it is enfolded in the care of its parents, which is like a 
spiritual womb, for so long as man has not the use of reason, he differs 
not from an irrational animal; so that even as an ox or a horse belongs 
to someone who, according to the civil law, can use them when he likes, 
as his own instrument, so, according to the natural law, a son, before 
coming to the use of reason, is under his father's care. Hence it would 
be contrary to natural justice, if a child, before coming to the use of 
reason, were to be taken away from its parents' custody, or anything done 
to it against its parents' wish. As soon, however, as it begins to have 
the use of its free-will, it begins to belong to itself, and is able to 
look after itself, in matters concerning the Divine or the natural law, 
and then it should be induced, not by compulsion but by persuasion, to 
embrace the faith: it can then consent to the faith, and be baptized, 
even against its parents' wish; but not before it comes to the use of 
reason. Hence it is said of the children of the fathers of old that they 
were saved in the faith of their parents; whereby we are given to 
understand that it is the parents' duty to look after the salvation of 
their children, especially before they come to the use of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the marriage bond, both husband and wife have the use of 
the free-will, and each can assent to the faith without the other's 
consent. But this does not apply to a child before it comes to the use of 
reason: yet the comparison holds good after the child has come to the use 
of reason, if it is willing to be converted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> No one should be snatched from natural death against the 
order of civil law: for instance, if a man were condemned by the judge to 
temporal death, nobody ought to rescue him by violence: hence no one 
ought to break the order of the  natural law, whereby a child is in the 
custody of its father, in order to rescue it from the danger of 
everlasting death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Jews are bondsmen of princes by civil bondage, which does 
not exclude the order of natural or Divine law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Man is directed to God by his reason, whereby he can know 
Him. Hence a child before coming to the use of reason, in the natural 
order of things, is directed to God by its parents' reason, under whose 
care it lies by nature: and it is for them to dispose of the child in all 
matters relating to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[10] A[12] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The peril that ensues from the omission of preaching, 
threatens only those who are entrusted with the duty of preaching. Hence 
it had already been said (Ezech. 3:17): "I have made thee a watchman to 
the children [Vulg.: 'house'] of Israel." On the other hand, to provide 
the sacraments of salvation for the children of unbelievers is the duty 
of their parents. Hence it is they whom the danger threatens, if through 
being deprived of the sacraments their children fail to obtain salvation.<br>
