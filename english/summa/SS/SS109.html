<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider truth and the vices opposed thereto. Concerning 
truth there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS109.html#SSQ109A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether truth is a virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS109.html#SSQ109A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a special virtue?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that truth is not a virtue. For the first of virtues is 
faith, whose object is truth. Since then the object precedes the habit 
and the act, it seems that truth is not a virtue, but something prior to 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 7), it belongs 
to truth that a man should state things concerning himself to be neither 
more nor less than they are. But this is not always 
praiseworthy---neither in good things, since according to Prov. 27:2, 
"Let another praise thee, and not thy own mouth"---nor even in evil 
things, because it is written in condemnation of certain people (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++3:9">Is. 3:9</a>): "They have proclaimed abroad their sin as Sodom, and they have not 
hid it." Therefore truth is not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every virtue is either theological, or  intellectual, or 
moral. Now truth is not a theological virtue, because its object is not 
God but temporal things. For Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that by 
"truth we faithfully represent things as they are were, or will be." 
Likewise it is not one of the intellectual virtues, but their end. Nor 
again is it a moral virtue, since it is not a mean between excess and 
deficiency, for the more one tells the truth, the better it is. Therefore 
truth is not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher both in the Second and in the Fourth 
Book of Ethics places truth among the other virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Truth can be taken in two ways. First, for that by reason 
of which a thing is said to be true, and thus truth is not a virtue, but 
the object or end of a virtue: because, taken in this way, truth is not a 
habit, which is the genus containing virtue, but a certain equality 
between the understanding or sign and the thing understood or signified, 
or again between a thing and its rule, as stated in the FP, Question [16], Article [1]; 
FP, Question [21], Article [2]. Secondly, truth may stand for that by which a person 
says what is true, in which sense one is said to be truthful. This truth 
or truthfulness must needs be a virtue, because to say what is true is a 
good act: and virtue is "that which makes its possessor good, and renders 
his action good."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument takes truth in the first sense.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To state that which concerns oneself, in so far as it is a 
statement of what is true, is good generically. Yet this does not suffice 
for it to be an act of virtue, since it is requisite for that purpose 
that it should also be clothed with the due circumstances, and if these 
be not observed, the act will be sinful. Accordingly it is sinful to 
praise oneself without due cause even for that which is true: and it is 
also sinful to publish one's sin, by praising oneself on that account, or 
in any way proclaiming it uselessly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A person who says what is true, utters certain signs which 
are in conformity with things; and such signs are either words, or 
external actions, or any external thing. Now such kinds of things are the 
subject-matter of the moral virtues alone, for the latter are concerned 
with the use of the external members, in so far as this use is put into 
effect at the command of the will. Wherefore truth is neither a 
theological, nor an intellectual, but a moral virtue. And it is a mean 
between excess and deficiency in two ways. First, on the part of the 
object, secondly, on the part of the act. On the part of the object, 
because the true essentially denotes a kind of equality, and equal is a 
mean between more and less. Hence for the very reason that a man says 
what is true about himself, he observes the mean between one that says 
more than the truth about himself, and one that says less than the truth. 
On the part of the act, to observe the mean is to tell the truth, when 
one ought, and as one ought. Excess consists in making known one's own 
affairs out of season, and  deficiency in hiding them when one ought to 
make them known.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether truth is a special virtue?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that truth is not a special virtue. For the true and the 
good are convertible. Now goodness is not a special virtue, in fact every 
virtue is goodness, because "it makes its possessor good." Therefore 
truth is not a special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to make known what belongs to oneself is an act of truth 
as we understand it here. But this belongs to every virtue, since every 
virtuous habit is made known by its own act. Therefore truth is not a 
special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the truth of life is the truth whereby one lives aright, 
and of which it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++38:3">Is. 38:3</a>): "I beseech Thee . . . remember how 
I have walked before Thee in truth, and with a perfect heart." Now one 
lives aright by any virtue, as follows from the definition of virtue 
given above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore truth is not a special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, truth seems to be the same as simplicity, since 
hypocrisy is opposed to both. But simplicity is not a special virtue, 
since it rectifies the intention, and that is required in every virtue. 
Therefore neither is truth a special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is numbered together with other virtues (Ethic. ii, 
7).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The nature of human virtue consists in making a man's 
deed good. Consequently whenever we find a special aspect of goodness in 
human acts, it is necessary that man be disposed thereto by a special 
virtue. And since according to Augustine (De Nat. Boni iii) good consists 
in order, it follows that a special aspect of good will be found where 
there is a special order. Now there is a special order whereby our 
externals, whether words or deeds, are duly ordered in relation to some 
thing, as sign to thing signified: and thereto man is perfected by the 
virtue of truth. Wherefore it is evident that truth is a special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The true and the good are convertible as to subject, since 
every true thing is good, and every good thing is true. But considered 
logically, they exceed one another, even as the intellect and will exceed 
one another. For the intellect understands the will and many things 
besides, and the will desires things pertaining to the intellect, and 
many others. Wherefore the "true" considered in its proper aspect as a 
perfection of the intellect is a particular good, since it is something 
appetible: and in like manner the "good" considered in its proper aspect 
as the end of the appetite is something true, since it is something 
intelligible. Therefore since virtue includes the aspect of goodness, it 
is possible for truth to be a special virtue, just as the "true" is a 
special good; yet it is not possible for goodness to be a special virtue, 
since rather, considered logically, it is  the genus of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The habits of virtue and vice take their species from what 
is directly intended, and not from that which is accidental and beside 
the intention. Now that a man states that which concerns himself, belongs 
to the virtue of truth, as something directly intended: although it may 
belong to other virtues consequently and beside his principal intention. 
For the brave man intends to act bravely: and that he shows his fortitude 
by acting bravely is a consequence beside his principal intention.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The truth of life is the truth whereby a thing is true, not 
whereby a person says what is true. Life like anything else is said to be 
true, from the fact that it attains its rule and measure, namely, the 
divine law; since rectitude of life depends on conformity to that law. 
This truth or rectitude is common to every virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Simplicity is so called from its opposition to duplicity, 
whereby, to wit, a man shows one thing outwardly while having another in 
his heart: so that simplicity pertains to this virtue. And it rectifies 
the intention, not indeed directly (since this belongs to every virtue), 
but by excluding duplicity, whereby a man pretends one thing and intends 
another.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether truth is a part of justice?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that truth is not a part of justice. For it seems proper 
to justice to give another man his due. But, by telling the truth, one 
does not seem to give another man his due, as is the case in all the 
foregoing parts of justice. Therefore truth is not a part of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, truth pertains to the intellect: whereas justice is in 
the will, as stated above (<A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore truth is not a part of 
justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Jerome truth is threefold, namely, "truth 
of life," "truth of justice," and "truth of doctrine." But none of these 
is a part of justice. For truth of life comprises all virtues, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS109.html#SSQ109A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3): truth of justice is the same as justice, so that it 
is not one of its parts; and truth of doctrine belongs rather to the 
intellectual virtues. Therefore truth is nowise a part of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) reckons truth among the 
parts of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS080.html#SSQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>), a virtue is annexed to justice, 
as secondary to a principal virtue, through having something in common 
with justice, while falling short from the perfect virtue thereof. Now 
the virtue of truth has two things in common with justice. In the first 
place it is directed to another,  since the manifestation, which we have 
stated to be an act of truth, is directed to another, inasmuch as one 
person manifests to another the things that concern himself. In the 
second place, justice sets up a certain equality between things, and this 
the virtue of truth does also, for it equals signs to the things which 
concern man himself. Nevertheless it falls short of the proper aspect of 
justice, as to the notion of debt: for this virtue does not regard legal 
debt, which justice considers, but rather the moral debt, in so far as, 
out of equity, one man owes another a manifestation of the truth. 
Therefore truth is a part of justice, being annexed thereto as a 
secondary virtue to its principal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since man is a social animal, one man naturally owes 
another whatever is necessary for the preservation of human society. Now 
it would be impossible for men to live together, unless they believed one 
another, as declaring the truth one to another. Hence the virtue of truth 
does, in a manner, regard something as being due.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Truth, as known, belongs to the intellect. But man, by his 
own will, whereby he uses both habits and members, utters external signs 
in order to manifest the truth, and in this way the manifestation of the 
truth is an act of the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The truth of which we are speaking now differs from the 
truth of life, as stated in the preceding Article [2], ad 3.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We speak of the truth of justice in two ways. In one way we refer to the 
fact that justice itself is a certain rectitude regulated according to 
the rule of the divine law; and in this way the truth of justice differs 
from the truth of life, because by the truth of life a man lives aright 
in himself, whereas by the truth of justice a man observes the rectitude 
of the law in those judgments which refer to another man: and in this 
sense the truth of justice has nothing to do with the truth of which we 
speak now, as neither has the truth of life. In another way the truth of 
justice may be understood as referring to the fact that, out of justice, 
a man manifests the truth, as for instance when a man confesses the 
truth, or gives true evidence in a court of justice. This truth is a 
particular act of justice, and does not pertain directly to this truth of 
which we are now speaking, because, to wit, in this manifestation of the 
truth a man's chief intention is to give another man his due. Hence the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 7) in describing this virtue: "We are not 
speaking of one who is truthful in his agreements, nor does this apply to 
matters in which justice or injustice is questioned."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth of doctrine consists in a certain manifestation of truths 
relating to science wherefore neither does this truth directly pertain to 
this virtue, but only that truth whereby a man, both in life and in 
speech, shows himself to be such as he is, and the things that concern 
him, not other, and neither greater nor less, than they are. Nevertheless 
since truths of science, as known by us, are something concerning us, and 
pertain to this virtue, in  this sense the truth of doctrine may pertain 
to this virtue, as well as any other kind of truth whereby a man 
manifests, by word or deed, what he knows.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the virtue of truth inclines rather to that which is less?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the virtue of truth does not incline to that which 
is less. For as one incurs falsehood by saying more, so does one by 
saying less: thus it is no more false that four are five, than that four 
are three. But "every falsehood is in itself evil, and to be avoided," as 
the Philosopher declares (Ethic. iv, 7). Therefore the virtue of truth 
does not incline to that which is less rather than to that which is 
greater.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that a virtue inclines to the one extreme rather than to 
the other, is owing to the fact that the virtue's mean is nearer to the 
one extreme than to the other: thus fortitude is nearer to daring than to 
timidity. But the mean of truth is not nearer to one extreme than to the 
other; because truth, since it is a kind of equality, holds to the exact 
mean. Therefore truth does not more incline to that which is less.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to forsake the truth for that which is less seems to 
amount to a denial of the truth, since this is to subtract therefrom; and 
to forsake the truth for that which is greater seems to amount to an 
addition thereto. Now to deny the truth is more repugnant to truth than 
to add something to it, because truth is incompatible with the denial of 
truth, whereas it is compatible with addition. Therefore it seems that 
truth should incline to that which is greater rather than to that which 
is less.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 7) that "by this 
virtue a man declines rather from the truth towards that which is less."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are two ways of declining from the truth to that 
which is less. First, by affirming, as when a man does not show the whole 
good that is in him, for instance science, holiness and so forth. This is 
done without prejudice to truth, since the lesser is contained in the 
greater: and in this way this virtue inclines to what is less. For, as 
the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 7), "this seems to be more prudent 
because exaggerations give annoyance." For those who represent themselves 
as being greater than they are, are a source of annoyance to others, 
since they seem to wish to surpass others: whereas those who make less 
account of themselves are a source of pleasure, since they seem to defer 
to others by their moderation. Hence the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Cor++12:6">2 Cor. 12:6</a>): 
"Though I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be foolish: for I will 
say the truth. But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that 
which he seeth in me or anything he heareth from me."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, one may incline to what is less by denying, so as to say that 
what is in us is not. In this way it does not belong to  this virtue to 
incline to what is less, because this would imply falsehood. And yet this 
would be less repugnant to the truth, not indeed as regards the proper 
aspect of truth, but as regards the aspect of prudence, which should be 
safeguarded in all the virtues. For since it is fraught with greater 
danger and is more annoying to others, it is more repugnant to prudence 
to think or boast that one has what one has not, than to think or say 
that one has not what one has.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[109] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
