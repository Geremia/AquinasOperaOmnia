<H3 Align="Center">OF SUPERSTITION CONSISTING IN UNDUE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE GOD (TWO ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the species of superstition. We shall treat (1) Of 
the superstition which consists in giving undue worship to the true God; 
(2) Of the superstition of idolatry; (3) of divinatory superstition; (4) 
of the superstition of observances.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are two points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS093.html#SSQ93A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there can be anything pernicious in the worship of the true 
God?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS093.html#SSQ93A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether there can be anything superfluous therein?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there cannot be anything pernicious in the 
worship of the true God. It is written (Joel 2:32): "Everyone that shall 
call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." Now whoever worships God 
calls upon His name. Therefore all worship of God is conducive to 
salvation, and consequently none is pernicious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is the same God that is worshiped by the just in any 
age of the world. Now before the giving of the Law the just worshiped God 
in whatever manner they pleased, without committing mortal sin: wherefore 
Jacob bound himself by his own vow to a special kind of worship, as 
related in Genesis 28. Therefore now also no worship of God is pernicious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing pernicious is tolerated in the Church. Yet the 
Church tolerates various rites of divine worship: wherefore Gregory, 
replying to Augustine, bishop of the English (Regist. xi, ep. 64), who 
stated that there existed in the churches various customs in the 
celebration of Mass, wrote: "I wish you to choose carefully whatever you 
find likely to be most pleasing to God, whether in the Roman territory, 
or in the land of the Gauls, or in any part of the Church." Therefore no 
way of worshiping God is pernicious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine [*Jerome (Ep. lxxv, ad Aug.) See Opp. August. 
Ep. lxxxii] in a letter to Jerome (and the words are quoted in a gloss on 
Gal. 2:14) says that "after the Gospel truth had been preached the legal 
observances became deadly," and yet these observances belonged to the 
worship of God. Therefore there can be something deadly in the divine 
worship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine states (Cont. Mendac. xiv), "a most 
pernicious lie is that which is uttered in matters pertaining to 
Christian religion." Now it is a lie if one signify outwardly that which 
is contrary to the truth. But just as a thing is signified by word, so it 
is by deed: and it is in this signification by deed that the outward 
worship of religion consists, as shown above (<A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Consequently, 
if anything false is signified by outward worship, this worship will be 
pernicious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this happens in two ways. In the first place, it happens on the part 
of the thing signified, through the worship signifying something 
discordant therefrom: and in this way, at the time of the New Law, the 
mysteries of Christ being already accomplished, it is pernicious to make 
use of the ceremonies of the Old Law whereby the mysteries of Christ were 
foreshadowed as things to come: just as it would be pernicious for anyone 
to declare that Christ has yet to suffer. In the second place, falsehood 
in outward worship occurs on the part of the worshiper, and especially in 
common worship which is offered by ministers impersonating the whole 
Church. For even as he would be guilty of falsehood who would, in the 
name of another person, proffer things that are not committed to him, so 
too does a man incur the guilt of falsehood who, on the part of the 
Church,  gives worship to God contrary to the manner established by the 
Church or divine authority, and according to ecclesiastical custom. Hence 
Ambrose [*Comment. in 1 ad Cor. 11:27, quoted in the gloss of Peter 
Lombard] says: "He is unworthy who celebrates the mystery otherwise than 
Christ delivered it." For this reason, too, a gloss on Col. 2:23 says 
that superstition is "the use of human observances under the name of 
religion."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since God is truth, to invoke God is to worship Him in 
spirit and truth, according to Jn. 4:23. Hence a worship that contains 
falsehood, is inconsistent with a salutary calling upon God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Before the time of the Law the just were instructed by an 
inward instinct as to the way of worshiping God, and others followed 
them. But afterwards men were instructed by outward precepts about this 
matter, and it is wicked to disobey them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The various customs of the Church in the divine worship are 
in no way contrary to the truth: wherefore we must observe them, and to 
disregard them is unlawful.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether there can be any excess in the worship of God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there cannot be excess in the worship of God. 
It is written (Ecclus. 43:32): "Glorify the Lord as much as ever you can, 
for He will yet far exceed." Now the divine worship is directed to the 
glorification of God. Therefore there can be no excess in it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, outward worship is a profession of inward worship, 
"whereby God is worshiped with faith, hope, and charity," as Augustine 
says (Enchiridion iii). Now there can be no excess in faith, hope, and 
charity. Neither, therefore, can there be in the worship of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to worship God consists in offering to Him what we have 
received from Him. But we have received all our goods from God. Therefore 
if we do all that we possibly can for God's honor, there will be no 
excess in the divine worship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 18) "that the 
good and true Christian rejects also superstitious fancies, from Holy 
Writ." But Holy Writ teaches us to worship God. Therefore there can be 
superstition by reason of excess even in the worship of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing is said to be in excess in two ways. First, with 
regard to absolute quantity, and in this way there cannot be excess in 
the worship of God, because whatever man does is less than he owes God. 
Secondly, a thing is in excess with regard to quantity of proportion, 
through not being proportionate  to its end. Now the end of divine 
worship is that man may give glory to God, and submit to Him in mind and 
body. Consequently, whatever a man may do conducing to God's glory, and 
subjecting his mind to God, and his body, too, by a moderate curbing of 
the concupiscences, is not excessive in the divine worship, provided it 
be in accordance with the commandments of God and of the Church, and in 
keeping with the customs of those among whom he lives.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand if that which is done be, in itself, not conducive to 
God's glory, nor raise man's mind to God, nor curb inordinate 
concupiscence, or again if it be not in accordance with the commandments 
of God and of the Church, or if it be contrary to the general 
custom---which, according to Augustine [*Ad Casulan. Ep. xxxvi], "has the 
force of law"---all this must be reckoned excessive and superstitious, 
because consisting, as it does, of mere externals, it has no connection 
with the internal worship of God. Hence Augustine (De Vera Relig. iii) 
quotes the words of Lk. 17:21, "The kingdom of God is within you," 
against the "superstitious," those, to wit, who pay more attention to 
externals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The glorification of God implies that what is done is done 
for God's glory: and this excludes the excess denoted by superstition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Faith, hope and charity subject the mind to God, so that 
there can be nothing excessive in them. It is different with external 
acts, which sometimes have no connection with these virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[93] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers excess by way of absolute quantity.
