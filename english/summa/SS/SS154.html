    Whether six species are fittingly assigned to lust?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that six species are unfittingly
    assigned to lust, namely, "simple fornication, adultery, incest, seduction,
    rape, and the unnatural vice." For diversity of matter does not diversify
    the species. Now the aforesaid division is made with regard to diversity of
    matter, according as the woman with whom a man has intercourse is married or
    a virgin, or of some other condition. Therefore it seems that the species of
    lust are diversified in this way.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, seemingly the species of one vice are
    not differentiated by things that belong to another vice. Now adultery does
    not differ from simple fornication, save in the point of a man having
    intercourse with one who is another's, so that he commits an injustice.
    Therefore it seems that adultery should not be reckoned a species of
    lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as a man may happen to have
    intercourse with a woman who is bound to another man by marriage, so may it
    happen that a man has intercourse with a woman who is bound to God by vow.
    Therefore sacrilege should be reckoned a species of lust, even as adultery
    is.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a married man sins not only if he be
    with another woman, but also if he use his own wife inordinately. But the
    latter sin is comprised under lust. Therefore it should be reckoned among
    the species thereof.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++12%3A21"
      >2 Cor. 12:21</a
    >): "Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you, and I mourn many of
    them /that sinned before, and have not done penance for the uncleanness and
    fornication and lasciviousness that they have committed." Therefore it seems
    that also uncleanness and lasciviousness should be reckoned species of lust,
    as well as fornication.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, the thing divided is not to be reckoned
    among its parts. But lust is reckoned together with the aforesaid: for it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A19"
      >Gal. 5:19</a
    >): "The works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication,
    uncleanness, immodesty, lust [Douay: 'luxury']." Therefore it seems that
    fornication is unfittingly reckoned a species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The aforesaid division is given in the
    Decretals 36, qu. i [*Append. Grat. ad can. Lex illa].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    I answer that As stated above (<a href="SS153.html#SSQ153OUTP1"
      >Question [153]</a
    >, <a href="SS153.html#SSQ153A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), the sin of lust
    consists in seeking venereal pleasure not in accordance with right reason.
    This may happen in two ways. First, in respect of the matter wherein this
    pleasure is sought; secondly, when, whereas there is due matter, other due
    circumstances are not observed. And since a circumstance, as such, does not
    specify a moral act, whose species is derived from its object which is also
    its matter, it follows that the species of lust must be assigned with
    respect to its matter or object.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now this same matter may be discordant with right reason in two ways. First,
    because it is inconsistent with the end of the venereal act. In this way, as
    hindering the begetting of children, there is the "vice against nature,"
    which attaches to every venereal act from which generation cannot follow;
    and, as hindering the due upbringing and advancement of the child when born,
    there is "simple fornication," which is the union of an unmarried man with
    an unmarried woman. Secondly, the matter wherein the venereal act is
    consummated may be discordant with right reason in relation to other
    persons; and this in two ways. First, with regard to the woman, with whom a
    man has connection, by reason of due honor not being paid to her; and thus
    there is "incest," which consists in the misuse of a woman who is related by
    consanguinity or affinity. Secondly, with regard to the person under whose
    authority the woman is placed: and if she be under the authority of a
    husband, it is "adultery," if under the authority of her father, it is
    "seduction," in the absence of violence, and "rape" if violence be
    employed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    These species are differentiated on the part of the woman rather than of the
    man, because in the venereal act the woman is passive and is by way of
    matter, whereas the man is by way of agent; and it has been stated above
    (Objection [1]) that the aforesaid species are assigned with regard to a
    difference of matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The aforesaid diversity of matter is
    connected with a formal difference of object, which difference results from
    different modes of opposition to right reason, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), nothing hinders
    the deformities of different vices concurring in the one act, and in this
    way adultery is comprised under lust and injustice. Nor is this deformity of
    injustice altogether accidental to lust: since the lust that obeys
    concupiscence so far as to lead to injustice, is thereby shown to be more
    grievous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since a woman, by vowing continence,
    contracts a spiritual marriage with God, the sacrilege that is committed in
    the violation of such a woman is a spiritual adultery. In like manner, the
    other kinds of sacrilege pertaining to lustful matter are reduced to other
    species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The sin of a husband with his wife is
    not connected with undue matter, but with other circumstances, which do not
    constitute the species of a moral act, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> As a gloss says on this passage,
    "uncleanness" stands for lust against nature, while "lasciviousness" is a
    man's abuse of boys, wherefore it would appear to pertain to seduction. We
    may also reply that "lasciviousness" relates to certain acts circumstantial
    to the venereal act, for instance kisses, touches, and so forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> According to a gloss on this passage
    "lust" there signifies any kind of excess.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether simple fornication is a mortal sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that simple fornication is not a
    mortal sin. For things that come under the same head would seem to be on a
    par with one another. Now fornication comes under the same head as things
    that are not mortal sins: for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+15%3A29"
      >Acts 15:29</a
    >): "That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and
    from things strangled, and from fornication." But there is not mortal sin in
    these observances, according to 1 Tim. 4:4, "Nothing is rejected that is
    received with thanksgiving." Therefore fornication is not a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no mortal sin is the matter of a Divine
    precept. But the Lord commanded (Osee 1:2): "Go take thee a wife of
    fornications, and have of her children of fornications." Therefore
    fornication is not a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no mortal sin is mentioned in Holy Writ
    without disapprobation. Yet simple fornication is mentioned without
    disapprobation by Holy Writ in connection with the patriarchs. Thus we read
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++16%3A4">Gn. 16:4</a>)
    that Abraham went in to his handmaid Agar; and further on (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++30%3A5,9"
      >Gn. 30:5,9</a
    >) that Jacob went in to Bala and Zelpha the handmaids of his wives; and
    again (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++38%3A18"
      >Gn. 38:18</a
    >) that Juda was with Thamar whom he thought to be a harlot. Therefore
    simple fornication is not a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, every mortal sin is contrary to charity.
    But simple fornication is not contrary to charity, neither as regards the
    love of God, since it is not a sin directly against God, nor as regards the
    love of our neighbor, since thereby no one is injured. Therefore simple
    fornication is not a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, every mortal sin leads to eternal
    perdition. But simple fornication has not this result: because a gloss of
    Ambrose [*The quotation is from the Gloss of Peter Lombard, who refers it to
    St. Ambrose: whereas it is from Hilary the deacon] on 1 Tim. 4:8, "Godliness
    is profitable to all things," says: "The whole of Christian teaching is
    summed up in mercy and godliness: if a man conforms to this, even though he
    gives way to the inconstancy of the flesh, doubtless he will be punished,
    but he will not perish." Therefore simple fornication is not a mortal
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Bono Conjug. xvi)
    that "what food is to the well-being of the body, such is sexual intercourse
    to the welfare of the human race." But inordinate use of food is not always
    a mortal sin. Therefore neither is all inordinate sexual intercourse; and
    this would seem to apply especially to simple fornication, which is the
    least grievous of the aforesaid species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Tob. 4:13): "Take heed to keep
    thyself... from all fornication, and beside thy wife never endure to know a
    crime." Now crime denotes a mortal sin. Therefore fornication and all
    intercourse with other than one's wife is a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, nothing but mortal sin debars a man from God's kingdom. But
    fornication debars him, as shown by the words of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A21"
      >Gal. 5:21</a
    >), who after mentioning fornication and certain other vices, adds: "They
    who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God." Therefore simple
    fornication is a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is written in the Decretals (XXII, qu. i, can. Praedicandum):
    "They should know that the same penance is to be enjoined for perjury as for
    adultery, fornication, and wilful murder and other criminal offenses."
    Therefore simple fornication is a criminal or mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Without any doubt we must hold simple
    fornication to be a mortal sin, notwithstanding that a gloss [*St.
    Augustine, Questions. in Deut., qu. 37] on Dt. 23:17, says: "This is a
    prohibition against going with whores, whose vileness is venial." For
    instead of "venial" it should be "venal," since such is the wanton's trade.
    In order to make this evident, we must take note that every sin committed
    directly against human life is a mortal sin. Now simple fornication implies
    an inordinateness that tends to injure the life of the offspring to be born
    of this union. For we find in all animals where the upbringing of the
    offspring needs care of both male and female, that these come together not
    indeterminately, but the male with a certain female, whether one or several;
    such is the case with all birds: while, on the other hand, among those
    animals, where the female alone suffices for the offspring's upbringing, the
    union is indeterminate, as in the case of dogs and like animals. Now it is
    evident that the upbringing of a human child requires not only the mother's
    care for his nourishment, but much more the care of his father as guide and
    guardian, and under whom he progresses in goods both internal and external.
    Hence human nature rebels against an indeterminate union of the sexes and
    demands that a man should be united to a determinate woman and should abide
    with her a long time or even for a whole lifetime. Hence it is that in the
    human race the male has a natural solicitude for the certainty of offspring,
    because on him devolves the upbringing of the child: and this certainly
    would cease if the union of sexes were indeterminate.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This union with a certain definite woman is called matrimony; which for the
    above reason is said to belong to the natural law. Since, however, the union
    of the sexes is directed to the common good of the whole human race, and
    common goods depend on the law for their determination, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS090.html#FSQ90A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it follows that
    this union of man and woman, which is called matrimony, is determined by
    some law. What this determination is for us will be stated in the Third Part
    of this work (<a href="../XP.html">XP</a>,
    <a href="../XP/XP050.html#XPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>, seqq.), where we
    shall treat of the sacrament of matrimony. Wherefore, since fornication is
    an indeterminate union of the sexes, as something incompatible with
    matrimony, it is opposed to the good of the child's upbringing, and
    consequently it is a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nor does it matter if a man having knowledge of a woman by fornication, make
    sufficient provision for the upbringing of the child: because a matter that
    comes under the determination of the law is judged according to what happens
    in general, and not according to what may happen in a particular case.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Fornication is reckoned in conjunction
    with these things, not as being on a par with them in sinfulness, but
    because the matters mentioned there were equally liable to cause dispute
    between Jews and Gentiles, and thus prevent them from agreeing unanimously.
    For among the Gentiles, fornication was not deemed unlawful, on account of
    the corruption of natural reason: whereas the Jews, taught by the Divine
    law, considered it to be unlawful. The other things mentioned were loathsome
    to the Jews through custom introduced by the law into their daily life.
    Hence the Apostles forbade these things to the Gentiles, not as though they
    were unlawful in themselves, but because they were loathsome to the Jews, as
    stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS103.html#FSQ103OUTP1">Question [103]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS103.html#FSQ103A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 3).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Fornication is said to be a sin, because
    it is contrary to right reason. Now man's reason is right, in so far as it
    is ruled by the Divine Will, the first and supreme rule. Wherefore that
    which a man does by God's will and in obedience to His command, is not
    contrary to right reason, though it may seem contrary to the general order
    of reason: even so, that which is done miraculously by the Divine power is
    not contrary to nature, though it be contrary to the usual course of nature.
    Therefore just as Abraham did not sin in being willing to slay his innocent
    son, because he obeyed God, although considered in itself it was contrary to
    right human reason in general, so, too, Osee sinned not in committing
    fornication by God's command. Nor should such a copulation be strictly
    called fornication, though it be so called in reference to the general
    course of things. Hence Augustine says (Confess. iii, 8): "When God commands
    a thing to be done against the customs or agreement of any people, though it
    were never done by them heretofore, it is to be done"; and afterwards he
    adds: "For as among the powers of human society, the greater authority is
    obeyed in preference to the lesser, so must God in preference to all."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Abraham and Jacob went in to their
    handmaidens with no purpose of fornication, as we shall show further on when
    we treat of matrimony (<a href="../XP.html">XP</a>,
    <a href="../XP/XP065.html#XPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="../XP/XP065.html#XPQ65A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 2). As to Juda
    there is no need to excuse him, for he also caused Joseph to be sold.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Simple fornication is contrary to the
    love of our neighbor, because it is opposed to the good of the child to be
    born, as we have shown, since it is an act of generation accomplished in a
    manner disadvantageous to the future child.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> A person, who, while given to works of
    piety, yields to the inconstancy of the flesh, is freed from eternal loss,
    in so far as these works dispose him to receive the grace to repent, and
    because by such works he makes satisfaction for his past inconstancy; but
    not so as to be freed by pious works, if he persist in carnal inconstancy
    impenitent until death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> One copulation may result in the
    begetting of a man, wherefore inordinate copulation, which hinders the good
    of the future child, is a mortal sin as to the very genus of the act, and
    not only as to the inordinateness of concupiscence. On the other hand, one
    meal does not hinder the good of a man's whole life, wherefore the act of
    gluttony is not a mortal sin by reason of its genus. It would, however, be a
    mortal sin, if a man were knowingly to partake of a food which would alter
    the whole condition of his life, as was the case with Adam.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nor is it true that fornication is the least of the sins comprised under
    lust, for the marriage act that is done out of sensuous pleasure is a lesser
    sin.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether fornication is the most grievous of sins?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that fornication is the most
    grievous of sins. For seemingly a sin is the more grievous according as it
    proceeds from a greater sensuous pleasure. Now the greatest sensuous
    pleasure is in fornication, for a gloss on 1 Cor. 7:9 says that the "flame
    of sensuous pleasure is most fierce in lust." Therefore it seems that
    fornication is the gravest of sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a sin is the more grievous that is
    committed against a person more closely united to the sinner: thus he sins
    more grievously who strikes his father than one who strikes a stranger. Now
    according to 1 Cor. 6:18, "He that committeth fornication sinneth against
    his own body," which is most intimately connected with a man. Therefore it
    seems that fornication is the most grievous of sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the greater a good is, the graver would
    seem to be the sin committed against it. Now the sin of fornication is
    seemingly opposed to the good of the whole human race, as appears from what
    was said in the foregoing Article. It is also against Christ, according to 1
    Cor. 6:15, "Shall I... take the members of Christ, and make them the members
    of a harlot?" Therefore fornication is the most grievous of sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xxxiii, 12) that the
    sins of the flesh are less grievous than spiritual sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The gravity of a sin may be measured in two
    ways, first with regard to the sin in itself, secondly with regard to some
    accident. The gravity of a sin is measured with regard to the sin itself, by
    reason of its species, which is determined according to the good to which
    that sin is opposed. Now fornication is contrary to the good of the child to
    be born. Wherefore it is a graver sin, as to its species, than those sins
    which are contrary to external goods, such as theft and the like; while it
    is less grievous than those which are directly against God, and sins that
    are injurious to the life of one already born, such as murder.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The sensual pleasure that aggravates a
    sin is that which is in the inclination of the will. But the sensual
    pleasure that is in the sensitive appetite, lessens sin, because a sin is
    the less grievous according as it is committed under the impulse of a
    greater passion. It is in this way that the greatest sensual pleasure is in
    fornication. Hence Augustine says (De Agone Christiano [*Serm. ccxciii; ccl
    de Temp.; see Appendix to St. Augustine's works]) that of all a Christian's
    conflicts, the most difficult combats are those of chastity; wherein the
    fight is a daily one, but victory rare: and Isidore declares (De Summo Bono
    ii, 39) that "mankind is subjected to the devil by carnal lust more than by
    anything else," because, to wit, the vehemence of this passion is more
    difficult to overcome.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The fornicator is said to sin against
    his own body, not merely because the pleasure of fornication is consummated
    in the flesh, which is also the case in gluttony, but also because he acts
    against the good of his own body by an undue resolution and defilement
    thereof, and an undue association with another. Nor does it follow from this
    that fornication is the most grievous sin, because in man reason is of
    greater value than the body, wherefore if there be a sin more opposed to
    reason, it will be more grievous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sin of fornication is contrary to
    the good of the human race, in so far as it is prejudicial to the individual
    begetting of the one man that may be born. Now one who is already an actual
    member of the human species attains to the perfection of the species more
    than one who is a man potentially, and from this point of view murder is a
    more grievous sin than fornication and every kind of lust, through being
    more opposed to the good of the human species. Again, a Divine good is
    greater than the good of the human race: and therefore those sins also that
    are against God are more grievous. Moreover, fornication is a sin against
    God, not directly as though the fornicator intended to offend God, but
    consequently, in the same way as all mortal sins. And just as the members of
    our body are Christ's members, so too, our spirit is one with Christ,
    according to 1 Cor. 6:17, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."
    Wherefore also spiritual sins are more against Christ than fornication
    is.<br />

    Whether there can be mortal sin in touches and kisses?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is no mortal sin in
    touches and kisses. For the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A3"
      >Eph. 5:3</a
    >): "Fornication and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not so much as
    be named among you, as becometh saints," then he adds: "Or obscenity" (which
    a gloss refers to "kissing and fondling"), "or foolish talking" (as "soft
    speeches"), "or scurrility" (which "fools call geniality---i.e.
    jocularity"), and afterwards he continues (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A5"
      >Eph. 5:5</a
    >): "For know ye this and understand that no fornicator, or unclean, or
    covetous person (which is the serving of idols), hath inheritance in the
    kingdom of Christ and of God," thus making no further mention of obscenity,
    as neither of foolish talking or scurrility. Therefore these are not mortal
    sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, fornication is stated to be a mortal sin
    as being prejudicial to the good of the future child's begetting and
    upbringing. But these are not affected by kisses and touches or
    blandishments. Therefore there is no mortal sin in these.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things that are mortal sins in
    themselves can never be good actions. Yet kisses, touches, and the like can
    be done sometimes without sin. Therefore they are not mortal sins in
    themselves.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A lustful look is less than a touch, a caress
    or a kiss. But according to Mt. 5:28, "Whosoever shall look on a woman to
    lust after her hath already committed adultery with her in his heart." Much
    more therefore are lustful kisses and other like things mortal sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, Cyprian says (Ad Pompon, de Virgin., Ep. lxii), "By their very
    intercourse, their blandishments, their converse, their embraces, those who
    are associated in a sleep that knows neither honor nor shame, acknowledge
    their disgrace and crime." Therefore by doing these things a man is guilty
    of a crime, that is, of mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing is said to be a mortal sin in two ways.
    First, by reason of its species, and in this way a kiss, caress, or touch
    does not, of its very nature, imply a mortal sin, for it is possible to do
    such things without lustful pleasure, either as being the custom of one's
    country, or on account of some obligation or reasonable cause. Secondly, a
    thing is said to be a mortal sin by reason of its cause: thus he who gives
    an alms, in order to lead someone into heresy, sins mortally on account of
    his corrupt intention. Now it has been stated above (FS, Question [74],
    Article [8]), that it is a mortal sin not only to consent to the act, but
    also to the delectation of a mortal sin. Wherefore since fornication is a
    mortal sin, and much more so the other kinds of lust, it follows that in
    such like sins not only consent to the act but also consent to the pleasure
    is a mortal sin. Consequently, when these kisses and caresses are done for
    this delectation, it follows that they are mortal sins, and only in this way
    are they said to be lustful. Therefore in so far as they are lustful, they
    are mortal sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle makes no further mention of
    these three because they are not sinful except as directed to those that he
    had mentioned before.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although kisses and touches do not by
    their very nature hinder the good of the human offspring, they proceed from
    lust, which is the source of this hindrance: and on this account they are
    mortally sinful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument proves that such things
    are not mortal sins in their species.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether nocturnal pollution is a mortal sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that nocturnal pollution is a sin.
    For the same things are the matter of merit and demerit. Now a man may merit
    while he sleeps, as was the case with Solomon, who while asleep obtained the
    gift of wisdom from the Lord (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Kgs++3%3A2,+Par++1"
      >3 Kgs. 3:2, Par. 1</a
    >). Therefore a man may demerit while asleep; and thus nocturnal pollution
    would seem to be a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever has the use of reason can sin.
    Now a man has the use of reason while asleep, since in our sleep we
    frequently discuss matters, choose this rather than that, consenting to one
    thing, or dissenting to another. Therefore one may sin while asleep, so that
    nocturnal pollution is not prevented by sleep from being a sin, seeing that
    it is a sin according to its genus.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is useless to reprove and instruct
    one who cannot act according to or against reason. Now man, while asleep, is
    instructed and reproved by God, according to Job 33:15,16, "By a dream in a
    vision by night, when deep sleep is wont to lay hold of men [*Vulg.: 'When
    deep sleep falleth upon men.' St. Thomas is apparently quoting from memory,
    as the passage is given correctly above, Question [95], Article [6],
    Objection [1]]... Then He openeth the ears of men, and teaching instructeth
    them in what they are to learn." Therefore a man, while asleep, can act
    according to or against his reason, and this is to do good or sinful
    actions, and thus it seems that nocturnal pollution is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 15): "When
    the same image that comes into the mind of a speaker presents itself to the
    mind of the sleeper, so that the latter is unable to distinguish the
    imaginary from the real union of bodies, the flesh is at once moved, with
    the result that usually follows such motions; and yet there is as little sin
    in this as there is in speaking and therefore thinking about such things
    while one is awake."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Nocturnal pollution may be considered in two
    ways. First, in itself; and thus it has not the character of a sin. For
    every sin depends on the judgment of reason, since even the first movement
    of the sensuality has nothing sinful in it, except in so far as it can be
    suppressed by reason; wherefore in the absence of reason's judgment, there
    is no sin in it. Now during sleep reason has not a free judgment. For there
    is no one who while sleeping does not regard some of the images formed by
    his imagination as though they were real, as stated above in the FP,
    Question [84], Article [8], ad 2. Wherefore what a man does while he sleeps
    and is deprived of reason's judgment, is not imputed to him as a sin, as
    neither are the actions of a maniac or an imbecile.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, nocturnal pollution may be considered with reference to its cause.
    This may be threefold. One is a bodily cause. For when there is excess of
    seminal humor in the body, or when the humor is disintegrated either through
    overheating of the body or some other disturbance, the sleeper dreams things
    that are connected with the discharge of this excessive or disintegrated
    humor: the same thing happens when nature is cumbered with other
    superfluities, so that phantasms relating to the discharge of those
    superfluities are formed in the imagination. Accordingly if this excess of
    humor be due to a sinful cause (for instance excessive eating or drinking),
    nocturnal pollution has the character of sin from its cause: whereas if the
    excess or disintegration of these superfluities be not due to a sinful
    cause, nocturnal pollution is not sinful, neither in itself nor in its
    cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    A second cause of nocturnal pollution is on the part of the soul and the
    inner man: for instance when it happens to the sleeper on account of some
    previous thought. For the thought which preceded while he was awake, is
    sometimes purely speculative, for instance when one thinks about the sins of
    the flesh for the purpose of discussion; while sometimes it is accompanied
    by a certain emotion either of concupiscence or of abhorrence. Now nocturnal
    pollution is more apt to arise from thinking about carnal sins with
    concupiscence for such pleasures, because this leaves its trace and
    inclination in the soul, so that the sleeper is more easily led in his
    imagination to consent to acts productive of pollution. In this sense the
    Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 13) that "in so far as certain movements in some
    degree pass" from the waking state to the state of sleep, "the dreams of
    good men are better than those of any other people": and Augustine says
    (Gen. ad lit. xii, 15) that "even during sleep, the soul may have
    conspicuous merit on account of its good disposition." Thus it is evident
    that nocturnal pollution may be sinful on the part of its cause. on the
    other hand, it may happen that nocturnal pollution ensues after thoughts
    about carnal acts, though they were speculative, or accompanied by
    abhorrence, and then it is not sinful, neither in itself nor in its
    cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The third cause is spiritual and external; for instance when by the work of
    a devil the sleeper's phantasms are disturbed so as to induce the aforesaid
    result. Sometimes this is associated with a previous sin, namely the neglect
    to guard against the wiles of the devil. Hence the words of the hymn at
    even: "Our enemy repress, that so our bodies no uncleanness know"
    [*Translation W. K. Blount].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, this may occur without any fault on man's part, and
    through the wickedness of the devil alone. Thus we read in the Collationes
    Patrum (Coll. xxii, 6) of a man who was ever wont to suffer from nocturnal
    pollution on festivals, and that the devil brought this about in order to
    prevent him from receiving Holy Communion. Hence it is manifest that
    nocturnal pollution is never a sin, but is sometimes the result of a
    previous sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Solomon did not merit to receive wisdom
    from God while he was asleep. He received it in token of his previous
    desire. It is for this reason that his petition is stated to have been
    pleasing to God (3 Kgs. 3:10), as Augustine observes (Gen. ad lit. xii,
    15).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The use of reason is more or less
    hindered in sleep, according as the inner sensitive powers are more or less
    overcome by sleep, on account of the violence or attenuation of the
    evaporations. Nevertheless it is always hindered somewhat, so as to be
    unable to elicit a judgment altogether free, as stated in the FP, Question
    [84], Article [8], ad 2. Therefore what it does then is not imputed to it as
    a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Reason's apprehension is not hindered
    during sleep to the same extent as its judgment, for this is accomplished by
    reason turning to sensible objects, which are the first principles of human
    thought. Hence nothing hinders man's reason during sleep from apprehending
    anew something arising out of the traces left by his previous thoughts and
    phantasms presented to him, or again through Divine revelation, or the
    interference of a good or bad angel.<br />

    Whether seduction should be reckoned a species of lust?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that seduction should not be
    reckoned a species of lust. For seduction denotes the unlawful violation of
    a virgin, according to the Decretals (XXXVI, qu. 1) [*Append. Grat. ad can.
    Lex illa]. But this may occur between an unmarried man and an unmarried
    woman, which pertains to fornication. Therefore seduction should not be
    reckoned a species of lust, distinct from fornication.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Ambrose says (De Patriarch. [*De Abraham
    i, 4]): "Let no man be deluded by human laws: all seduction is adultery."
    Now a species is not contained under another that is differentiated in
    opposition to it. Therefore since adultery is a species of lust, it seems
    that seduction should not be reckoned a species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to do a person an injury would seem to
    pertain to injustice rather than to lust. Now the seducer does an injury to
    another, namely the violated maiden's father, who "can take the injury as
    personal to himself" [*Gratian, ad can. Lex illa], and sue the seducer for
    damages. Therefore seduction should not be reckoned a species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Seduction consists properly in the venereal
    act whereby a virgin is violated. Therefore, since lust is properly about
    venereal actions, it would seem that seduction is a species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> When the matter of a vice has a special
    deformity, we must reckon it to be a determinate species of that vice. Now
    lust is a sin concerned with venereal matter, as stated above (<a
      href="SS153.html#SSQ153OUTP1"
      >Question [153]</a
    >, <a href="SS153.html#SSQ153A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). And a special
    deformity attaches to the violation of a virgin who is under her father's
    care: both on the part of the maid, who through being violated without any
    previous compact of marriage is both hindered from contracting a lawful
    marriage and is put on the road to a wanton life from which she was withheld
    lest she should lose the seal of virginity: and on the part of the father,
    who is her guardian, according to Ecclus. 42:11, "Keep a sure watch over a
    shameless daughter, lest at any time she make thee become a laughing-stock
    to thy enemies." Therefore it is evident that seduction which denotes the
    unlawful violation of a virgin, while still under the guardianship of her
    parents, is a determinate species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although a virgin is free from the bond
    of marriage, she is not free from her father's power. Moreover, the seal of
    virginity is a special obstacle to the intercourse of fornication, in that
    it should be removed by marriage only. Hence seduction is not simple
    fornication, since the latter is intercourse with harlots, women, namely,
    who are no longer virgins, as a gloss observes on 2 Cor. 12:, "And have not
    done penance for the uncleanness and fornication," etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Ambrose here takes seduction in another
    sense, as applicable in a general way to any sin of lust. Wherefore
    seduction, in the words quoted, signifies the intercourse between a married
    man and any woman other than his wife. This is clear from his adding: "Nor
    is it lawful for the husband to do what the wife may not." In this sense,
    too, we are to understand the words of Num. 5:13: "If [Vulg.: 'But'] the
    adultery is secret, and cannot be provided by witnesses, because she was not
    found in adultery [stupro]."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Nothing prevents a sin from having a
    greater deformity through being united to another sin. Now the sin of lust
    obtains a greater deformity from the sin of injustice, because the
    concupiscence would seem to be more inordinate, seeing that it refrains not
    from the pleasurable object so that it may avoid an injustice. In fact a
    twofold injustice attaches to it. One is on the part of the virgin, who,
    though not violated by force, is nevertheless seduced, and thus the seducer
    is bound to compensation. Hence it is written (<a

    him, he shall give money according to the dowry, which virgins are wont to
    receive." The other injury is done to the maid's father: wherefore the
    seducer is bound by the Law to a penalty in his regard. For it is written

    have her to wife, and because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away

    Whether rape is a species of lust, distinct from seduction?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that rape is not a species of lust,
    distinct from seduction. For Isidore says (Etym. v, 26) that "seduction
    [stuprum], or rape, properly speaking, is unlawful intercourse, and takes
    its name from its causing corruption: wherefore he that is guilty of rape is
    a seducer." Therefore it seems that rape should not be reckoned a species of
    lust distinct from seduction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, rape, apparently, implies violence. For
    it is stated in the Decretals (XXXVI, qu. 1 [*Append. Grat. ad can. Lex
    illa]) that "rape is committed when a maid is taken away by force from her
    father's house that after being violated she may be taken to wife." But the
    employment of force is accidental to lust, for this essentially regards the
    pleasure of intercourse. Therefore it seems that rape should not be reckoned
    a determinate species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the sin of lust is curbed by marriage:
    for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7%3A2"
      >1 Cor. 7:2</a
    >): "For fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife." Now rape is
    an obstacle to subsequent marriage, for it was enacted in the council of
    Meaux: "We decree that those who are guilty of rape, or of abducting or
    seducing women, should not have those women in marriage, although they
    should have subsequently married them with the consent of their parents."
    Therefore rape is not a determinate species of lust distinct from
    seduction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a man may have knowledge of his newly
    married wife without committing a sin of lust. Yet he may commit rape if he
    take her away by force from her parents' house, and have carnal knowledge of
    her. Therefore rape should not be reckoned a determinate species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Rape is unlawful sexual intercourse, as
    Isidore states (Etym. v, 26). But this pertains to the sin of lust.
    Therefore rape is a species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Rape, in the sense in which we speak of it now,
    is a species of lust: and sometimes it coincides with seduction; sometimes
    there is rape without seduction, and sometimes seduction without rape.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    They coincide when a man employs force in order unlawfully to violate a
    virgin. This force is employed sometimes both towards the virgin and towards
    her father; and sometimes towards the father and not to the virgin, for
    instance if she allows herself to be taken away by force from her father's
    house. Again, the force employed in rape differs in another way, because
    sometimes a maid is taken away by force from her parents' house, and is
    forcibly violated: while sometimes, though taken away by force, she is not
    forcibly violated, but of her own consent, whether by act of fornication or
    by the act of marriage: for the conditions of rape remain no matter how
    force is employed. There is rape without seduction if a man abduct a widow
    or one who is not a virgin. Hence Pope Symmachus says [*Ep. v ad Caesarium;
    Cf. can. Raptores xxxvi, qu. 2], "We abhor abductors whether of widows or of
    virgins on account of the heinousness of their crime."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    There is seduction without rape when a man, without employing force,
    violates a virgin unlawfully.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since rape frequently coincides with
    seduction, the one is sometimes used to signify the other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The employment of force would seem to
    arise from the greatness of concupiscence, the result being that a man does
    not fear to endanger himself by offering violence.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The rape of a maiden who is promised in
    marriage is to be judged differently from that of one who is not so
    promised. For one who is promised in marriage must be restored to her
    betrothed, who has a right to her in virtue of their betrothal: whereas one
    that is not promised to another must first of all be restored to her
    father's care, and then the abductor may lawfully marry her with her
    parents' consent. Otherwise the marriage is unlawful, since whosoever steals
    a thing he is bound to restore it. Nevertheless rape does not dissolve a
    marriage already contracted, although it is an impediment to its being
    contracted. As to the decree of the council in question, it was made in
    abhorrence of this crime, and has been abrogated. Wherefore Jerome [*The
    quotation is from Can. Tria. xxxvi, qu. 2] declares the contrary: "Three
    kinds of lawful marriage," says he, "are mentioned in Holy Writ. The first
    is that of a chaste maiden given away lawfully in her maidenhood to a man.
    The second is when a man finds a maiden in the city, and by force has carnal
    knowledge of her. If the father be willing, the man shall endow her
    according to the father's estimate, and shall pay the price of her purity
    [*Cf. Dt. 22:23-29]. The third is, when the maiden is taken away from such a
    man, and is given to another at the father's will."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also take this decree to refer to those who are promised to others in
    marriage, especially if the betrothal be expressed by words in the present
    tense.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The man who is just married has, in
    virtue of the betrothal, a certain right in her: wherefore, although he sins
    by using violence, he is not guilty of the crime of rape. Hence Pope
    Gelasius says [*Can. Lex illa, xxvii, qu. 2; xxxvi, qu. 1]: "This law of
    bygone rulers stated that rape was committed when a maiden, with regard to
    whose marriage nothing had so far been decided, was taken away by force."<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether adultery is determinate species of lust, distinct from the other
    species?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that adultery is not a determinate
    species of lust, distinct from the other species. For adultery takes its
    name from a man having intercourse "with a woman who is not his own [ad
    alteram]," according to a gloss [*St. Augustine: Serm. li, 13 de Divers.
    lxiii] on Ex. 20:14. Now a woman who is not one's own may be of various
    conditions, namely either a virgin, or under her father's care, or a harlot,
    or of any other description. Therefore it seems that adultery is not a
    species of lust distinct from the others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Jerome says [*Contra Jovin. i]: "It
    matters not for what reason a man behaves as one demented. Hence Sixtus the
    Pythagorean says in his Maxims: He that is insatiable of his wife is an
    adulterer," and in like manner one who is over enamored of any woman. Now
    every kind of lust includes a too ardent love. Therefore adultery is in
    every kind of lust: and consequently it should not be reckoned a species of
    lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, where there is the same kind of
    deformity, there would seem to be the same species of sin. Now, apparently,
    there is the same kind of deformity in seduction and adultery: since in
    either case a woman is violated who is under another person's authority.
    Therefore adultery is not a determinate species of lust, distinct from the
    others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Leo [*St. Augustine, De Bono Conjug. iv;
    Cf. Append. Grat. ad can. Ille autem. xxxii, qu. 5] says that "adultery is
    sexual intercourse with another man or woman in contravention of the
    marriage compact, whether through the impulse of one's own lust, or with the
    consent of the other party." Now this implies a special deformity of lust.
    Therefore adultery is a determinate species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Adultery, as its name implies, "is access to
    another's marriage-bed [ad alienum torum]" [*Cf. Append. Gratian, ad can.
    Ille autem. xxxii, qu. 1]. By so doing a man is guilty of a twofold offense
    against chastity and the good of human procreation. First, by accession to a
    woman who is not joined to him in marriage, which is contrary to the good of
    the upbringing of his own children. Secondly, by accession to a woman who is
    united to another in marriage, and thus he hinders the good of another's
    children. The same applies to the married woman who is corrupted by
    adultery. Wherefore it is written (Ecclus. 23:32,33): "Every woman... that
    leaveth her husband... shall be guilty of sin. For first she hath been
    unfaithful to the law of the Most High" (since there it is commanded: "Thou
    shalt not commit adultery"); "and secondly, she hath offended against her
    husband," by making it uncertain that the children are his: "thirdly, she
    hath fornicated in adultery, and hath gotten children of another man," which
    is contrary to the good of her offspring. The first of these, however, is
    common to all mortal sins, while the two others belong especially to the
    deformity of adultery. Hence it is manifest that adultery is a determinate
    species of lust, through having a special deformity in venereal acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> If a married man has intercourse with
    another woman, his sin may be denominated either with regard to him, and
    thus it is always adultery, since his action is contrary to the fidelity of
    marriage, or with regard to the woman with whom he has intercourse; and thus
    sometimes it is adultery, as when a married man has intercourse with
    another's wife; and sometimes it has the character of seduction, or of some
    other sin, according to various conditions affecting the woman with whom he
    has intercourse: and it has been stated above (<a
      href="SS154.html#SSQ154A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >) that the species of lust correspond to the various conditions of
    women.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Matrimony is specially ordained for the
    good of human offspring, as stated above (<a href="SS154.html#SSQ154A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). But adultery is specially opposed to matrimony, in the point of breaking
    the marriage faith which is due between husband and wife. And since the man
    who is too ardent a lover of his wife acts counter to the good of marriage
    if he use her indecently, although he be not unfaithful, he may in a sense
    be called an adulterer; and even more so than he that is too ardent a lover
    of another woman.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The wife is under her husband's
    authority, as united to him in marriage: whereas the maid is under her
    father's authority, as one who is to be married by that authority. Hence the
    sin of adultery is contrary to the good of marriage in one way, and the sin
    of seduction in another; wherefore they are reckoned to differ specifically.
    Of other matters concerning adultery we shall speak in the Third Part [*XP,
    Question [59], Article [3]; XP, Questions [60],62], when we treat of
    matrimony.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether incest is a determinate species of lust?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that incest is not a determinate
    species of lust. For incest [*'Incestus' is equivalent to 'in-castus =
    'unchaste'] takes its name from being a privation of chastity. But all kinds
    of lust are opposed to chastity. Therefore it seems that incest is not a
    species of lust, but is lust itself in general.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is stated in the Decretals (XXXVI,
    qu. 1 [*Cf. Append. Grat. ad can. Lex illa]) that "incest is intercourse
    between a man and a woman related by consanguinity or affinity." Now
    affinity differs from consanguinity. Therefore it is not one but several
    species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which does not, of itself, imply a
    deformity, does not constitute a determinate species of vice. But
    intercourse between those who are related by consanguinity or affinity does
    not, of itself, contain any deformity, else it would never have been lawful.
    Therefore incest is not a determinate species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The species of lust are distinguished
    according to the various conditions of women with whom a man has unlawful
    intercourse. Now incest implies a special condition on the part of the
    woman, because it is unlawful intercourse with a woman related by
    consanguinity or affinity as stated (Objection [2]). Therefore incest is a
    determinate species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS154.html#SSQ154ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,6) wherever we find something incompatible with the right use of venereal
    actions, there must needs be a determinate species of lust. Now sexual
    intercourse with women related by consanguinity or affinity is unbecoming to
    venereal union on three counts. First, because man naturally owes a certain
    respect to his parents and therefore to his other blood relations, who are
    descended in near degree from the same parents: so much so indeed that among
    the ancients, as Valerius Maximus relates [*Dict. Fact. Memor. ii, 1], it
    was not deemed right for a son to bathe with his father, lest they should
    see one another naked. Now from what has been said (<a
      href="SS142.html#SSQ142OUTP1"
      >Question [142]</a
    >, <a href="SS142.html#SSQ142A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>:
    <a href="SS151.html#SSQ151OUTP1">Question [151]</a>,
    <a href="SS151.html#SSQ151A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), it is evident that in
    venereal acts there is a certain shamefulness inconsistent with respect,
    wherefore men are ashamed of them. Wherefore it is unseemly that such
    persons should be united in venereal intercourse. This reason seems to be
    indicated (Lev. 18:7) where we read: "She is thy mother, thou shalt not
    uncover her nakedness," and the same is expressed further on with regard to
    others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The second reason is because blood relations must needs live in close touch
    with one another. Wherefore if they were not debarred from venereal union,
    opportunities of venereal intercourse would be very frequent and thus men's
    minds would be enervated by lust. Hence in the Old Law [*Lev. 18] the
    prohibition was apparently directed specially to those persons who must
    needs live together.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The third reason is, because this would hinder a man from having many
    friends: since through a man taking a stranger to wife, all his wife's
    relations are united to him by a special kind of friendship, as though they
    were of the same blood as himself. Wherefore Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xv,
    16): "The demands of charity are most perfectly satisfied by men uniting
    together in the bonds that the various ties of friendship require, so that
    they may live together in a useful and becoming amity; nor should one man
    have many relationships in one, but each should have one."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Aristotle adds another reason (2 Polit. ii): for since it is natural that a
    man should have a liking for a woman of his kindred, if to this be added the
    love that has its origin in venereal intercourse, his love would be too
    ardent and would become a very great incentive to lust: and this is contrary
    to chastity. Hence it is evident that incest is a determinate species of
    lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Unlawful intercourse between persons
    related to one another would be most prejudicial to chastity, both on
    account of the opportunities it affords, and because of the excessive ardor
    of love, as stated in the Article. Wherefore the unlawful intercourse
    between such persons is called "incest" antonomastically.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Persons are related by affinity through
    one who is related by consanguinity: and therefore since the one depends on
    the other, consanguinity and affinity entail the same kind of
    unbecomingness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There is something essentially
    unbecoming and contrary to natural reason in sexual intercourse between
    persons related by blood, for instance between parents and children who are
    directly and immediately related to one another, since children naturally
    owe their parents honor. Hence the Philosopher instances a horse (De Animal.
    ix, 47) which covered its own mother by mistake and threw itself over a
    precipice as though horrified at what it had done, because some animals even
    have a natural respect for those that have begotten them. There is not the
    same essential unbecomingness attaching to other persons who are related to
    one another not directly but through their parents: and, as to this,
    becomingness or unbecomingness varies according to custom, and human or
    Divine law: because, as stated above (<a href="SS154.html#SSQ154A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), sexual intercourse, being directed to the common good, is subject to
    law. Wherefore, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xv, 16), whereas the union of
    brothers and sisters goes back to olden times, it became all the more worthy
    of condemnation when religion forbade it.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether sacrilege can be a species of lust?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sacrilege cannot be a species
    of lust. For the same species is not contained under different genera that
    are not subalternated to one another. Now sacrilege is a species of
    irreligion, as stated above (<a href="SS099.html#SSQ99OUTP1"
      >Question [99]</a
    >, <a href="SS099.html#SSQ99A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore sacrilege
    cannot be reckoned a species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Decretals (XXXVI, qu. 1 [*Append.
    Grat. ad can. Lex illa]), do not place sacrilege among other sins which are
    reckoned species of lust. Therefore it would seem not to be a species of
    lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, something derogatory to a sacred thing
    may be done by the other kinds of vice, as well as by lust. But sacrilege is
    not reckoned a species of gluttony, or of any other similar vice. Therefore
    neither should it be reckoned a species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xv, 16) that "if
    it is wicked, through covetousness, to go beyond one's earthly bounds, how
    much more wicked is it through venereal lust to transgress the bounds of
    morals!" Now to go beyond one's earthly bounds in sacred matters is a sin of
    sacrilege. Therefore it is likewise a sin of sacrilege to overthrow the
    bounds of morals through venereal desire in sacred matters. But venereal
    desire pertains to lust. Therefore sacrilege is a species of lust.<br />

    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18ATHEP1">Articles [6]</a>,7), the act of a
    virtue or vice, that is directed to the end of another virtue or vice,
    assumes the latter's species: thus, theft committed for the sake of
    adultery, passes into the species of adultery. Now it is evident that as
    Augustine states (De Virgin. 8), the observance of chastity, by being
    directed to the worship of God, becomes an act of religion, as in the case
    of those who vow and keep chastity. Wherefore it is manifest that lust also,
    by violating something pertaining to the worship of God, belongs to the
    species of sacrilege: and in this way sacrilege may be accounted a species
    of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Lust, by being directed to another vice
    as its end, becomes a species of that vice: and so a species of lust may be
    also a species of irreligion, as of a higher genus.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The enumeration referred to, includes
    those sins which are species of lust by their very nature: whereas sacrilege
    is a species of lust in so far as it is directed to another vice as its end,
    and may coincide with the various species of lust. For unlawful intercourse
    between persons mutually united by spiritual relationship, is a sacrilege
    after the manner of incest. Intercourse with a virgin consecrated to God,
    inasmuch as she is the spouse of Christ, is sacrilege resembling adultery.
    If the maiden be under her father's authority, it will be spiritual
    seduction; and if force be employed it will be spiritual rape, which kind of
    rape even the civil law punishes more severely than others. Thus the Emperor
    Justinian says [*Cod. i, iii de Episc. et Cler. 5]: "If any man dare, I will
    not say to rape, but even to tempt a consecrated virgin with a view to
    marriage, he shall be liable to capital punishment."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sacrilege is committed on a consecrated
    thing. Now a consecrated thing is either a consecrated person, who is
    desired for sexual intercourse, and thus it is a kind of lust, or it is
    desired for possession, and thus it is a kind of injustice. Sacrilege may
    also come under the head of anger, for instance, if through anger an injury
    be done to a consecrated person. Again, one may commit a sacrilege by
    partaking gluttonously of sacred food. Nevertheless, sacrilege is ascribed
    more specially to lust which is opposed to chastity for the observance of
    which certain persons are specially consecrated.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the unnatural vice is a species of lust?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the unnatural vice is not a
    species of lust. For no mention of the vice against nature is made in the
    enumeration given above (<a href="SS154.html#SSQ154A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>,
    Objection [1]). Therefore it is not a species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, lust is contrary to virtue; and so it is
    comprised under vice. But the unnatural vice is comprised not under vice,
    but under bestiality, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 5).
    Therefore the unnatural vice is not a species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, lust regards acts directed to human
    generation, as stated above (<a href="SS153.html#SSQ153OUTP1"
      >Question [153]</a
    >, <a href="SS153.html#SSQ153A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>): Whereas the
    unnatural vice concerns acts from which generation cannot follow. Therefore
    the unnatural vice is not a species of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is reckoned together with the other
    species of lust (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++12%3A21"
      >2 Cor. 12:21</a
    >) where we read: "And have not done penance for the uncleanness, and
    fornication, and lasciviousness," where a gloss says: "Lasciviousness, i.e.,
    unnatural lust."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS154.html#SSQ154ATHEP1"
      >Articles [6]</a
    >,9) wherever there occurs a special kind of deformity whereby the venereal
    act is rendered unbecoming, there is a determinate species of lust. This may
    occur in two ways: First, through being contrary to right reason, and this
    is common to all lustful vices; secondly, because, in addition, it is
    contrary to the natural order of the venereal act as becoming to the human
    race: and this is called "the unnatural vice." This may happen in several
    ways. First, by procuring pollution, without any copulation, for the sake of
    venereal pleasure: this pertains to the sin of "uncleanness" which some call
    "effeminacy." Secondly, by copulation with a thing of undue species, and
    this is called "bestiality." Thirdly, by copulation with an undue sex, male
    with male, or female with female, as the Apostle states (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++1%3A27"
      >Rm. 1:27</a
    >): and this is called the "vice of sodomy." Fourthly, by not observing the
    natural manner of copulation, either as to undue means, or as to other
    monstrous and bestial manners of copulation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There we enumerated the species of lust
    that are not contrary to human nature: wherefore the unnatural vice was
    omitted.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Bestiality differs from vice, for the
    latter is opposed to human virtue by a certain excess in the same matter as
    the virtue, and therefore is reducible to the same genus.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The lustful man intends not human
    generation but venereal pleasures. It is possible to have this without those
    acts from which human generation follows: and it is that which is sought in
    the unnatural vice.<br />

    Whether the unnatural vice is the greatest sin among the species of lust?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the unnatural vice is not the
    greatest sin among the species of lust. For the more a sin is contrary to
    charity the graver it is. Now adultery, seduction and rape which are
    injurious to our neighbor are seemingly more contrary to the love of our
    neighbor, than unnatural sins, by which no other person is injured.
    Therefore the unnatural sin is not the greatest among the species of
    lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sins committed against God would seem to
    be the most grievous. Now sacrilege is committed directly against God, since
    it is injurious to the Divine worship. Therefore sacrilege is a graver sin
    than the unnatural vice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, seemingly, a sin is all the more
    grievous according as we owe a greater love to the person against whom that
    sin is committed. Now the order of charity requires that a man love more
    those persons who are united to him---and such are those whom he defiles by
    incest---than persons who are not connected with him, and whom in certain
    cases he defiles by the unnatural vice. Therefore incest is a graver sin
    than the unnatural vice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if the unnatural vice is most grievous,
    the more it is against nature the graver it would seem to be. Now the sin of
    uncleanness or effeminacy would seem to be most contrary to nature, since it
    would seem especially in accord with nature that agent and patient should be
    distinct from one another. Hence it would follow that uncleanness is the
    gravest of unnatural vices. But this is not true. Therefore unnatural vices
    are not the most grievous among sins of lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De adult. conjug. [*The
    quotation is from Cap. Adulterii xxxii, qu. 7. Cf. Augustine, De Bono
    Conjugali, viii.]) that "of all these," namely the sins belonging to lust,
    "that which is against nature is the worst."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In every genus, worst of all is the corruption
    of the principle on which the rest depend. Now the principles of reason are
    those things that are according to nature, because reason presupposes things
    as determined by nature, before disposing of other things according as it is
    fitting. This may be observed both in speculative and in practical matters.
    Wherefore just as in speculative matters the most grievous and shameful
    error is that which is about things the knowledge of which is naturally
    bestowed on man, so in matters of action it is most grave and shameful to
    act against things as determined by nature. Therefore, since by the
    unnatural vices man transgresses that which has been determined by nature
    with regard to the use of venereal actions, it follows that in this matter
    this sin is gravest of all. After it comes incest, which, as stated above
    (<a href="SS154.html#SSQ154A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>), is contrary to the
    natural respect which we owe persons related to us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    With regard to the other species of lust they imply a transgression merely
    of that which is determined by right reason, on the presupposition, however,
    of natural principles. Now it is more against reason to make use of the
    venereal act not only with prejudice to the future offspring, but also so as
    to injure another person besides. Wherefore simple fornication, which is
    committed without injustice to another person, is the least grave among the
    species of lust. Then, it is a greater injustice to have intercourse with a
    woman who is subject to another's authority as regards the act of
    generation, than as regards merely her guardianship. Wherefore adultery is
    more grievous than seduction. And both of these are aggravated by the use of
    violence. Hence rape of a virgin is graver than seduction, and rape of a
    wife than adultery. And all these are aggravated by coming under the head of
    sacrilege, as stated above (<a href="SS154.html#SSQ154A10THEP1"
      >Article [10]</a
    >, ad 2).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as the ordering of right reason
    proceeds from man, so the order of nature is from God Himself: wherefore in
    sins contrary to nature, whereby the very order of nature is violated, an
    injury is done to God, the Author of nature. Hence Augustine says (Confess.
    iii, 8): "Those foul offenses that are against nature should be everywhere
    and at all times detested and punished, such as were those of the people of
    Sodom, which should all nations commit, they should all stand guilty of the
    same crime, by the law of God which hath not so made men that they should so
    abuse one another. For even that very intercourse which should be between
    God and us is violated, when that same nature, of which He is the Author, is
    polluted by the perversity of lust."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Vices against nature are also against
    God, as stated above (ad 1), and are so much more grievous than the
    depravity of sacrilege, as the order impressed on human nature is prior to
    and more firm than any subsequently established order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The nature of the species is more
    intimately united to each individual, than any other individual is.
    Wherefore sins against the specific nature are more grievous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Gravity of a sin depends more on the
    abuse of a thing than on the omission of the right use. Wherefore among sins
    against nature, the lowest place belongs to the sin of uncleanness, which
    consists in the mere omission of copulation with another. While the most
    grievous is the sin of bestiality, because use of the due species is not
    observed. Hence a gloss on Gn. 37:2, "He accused his brethren of a most
    wicked crime," says that "they copulated with cattle." After this comes the
    sin of sodomy, because use of the right sex is not observed. Lastly comes
    the sin of not observing the right manner of copulation, which is more
    grievous if the abuse regards the "vas" than if it affects the manner of
    copulation in respect of other circumstances.<br />
