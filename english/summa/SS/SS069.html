    OF SINS COMMITTED AGAINST JUSTICE ON THE PART OF THE DEFENDANT (FOUR
    ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider those sins which are committed against justice on the
    part of the defendant. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS069.html#SSQ69A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is a mortal sin to deny
    the truth which would lead to one's condemnation?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS069.html#SSQ69A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is lawful to defend
    oneself with calumnies?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS069.html#SSQ69A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is lawful to escape
    condemnation by appealing?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS069.html#SSQ69A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is lawful for one who
    has been condemned to defend himself by violence if he be able to do so?<br />

    Whether one can, without a mortal sin, deny the truth which would lead to
    one's condemnation?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem one can, without a mortal sin, deny
    the truth which would lead to one's condemnation. For Chrysostom says (Hom.
    xxxi super Ep. ad Heb.): "I do not say that you should lay bare your guilt
    publicly, nor accuse yourself before others." Now if the accused were to
    confess the truth in court, he would lay bare his guilt and be his own
    accuser. Therefore he is not bound to tell the truth: and so he does not sin
    mortally if he tell a lie in court.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as it is an officious lie when one
    tells a lie in order to rescue another man from death, so is it an officious
    lie when one tells a lie in order to free oneself from death, since one is
    more bound towards oneself than towards another. Now an officious lie is
    considered not a mortal but a venial sin. Therefore if the accused denies
    the truth in court, in order to escape death, he does not sin mortally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every mortal sin is contrary to charity,
    as stated above (<a href="SS024.html#SSQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>,
    <a href="SS024.html#SSQ24A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>). But that the accused
    lie by denying himself to be guilty of the crime laid to his charge is not
    contrary to charity, neither as regards the love we owe God, nor as to the
    love due to our neighbor. Therefore such a lie is not a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Whatever is opposed to the glory of God is a
    mortal sin, because we are bound by precept to "do all to the glory of God"
    (1 Cor. 10:31). Now it is to the glory of God that the accused confess that
    which is alleged against him, as appears from the words of Josue to Achan,
    "My son, give glory to the Lord God of Israel, and confess and tell me what
    thou hast done, hide it not" (Joshua 7:19). Therefore it is a mortal sin to
    lie in order to cover one's guilt.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Whoever acts against the due order of justice,
    sins mortally, as stated above (<a href="SS059.html#SSQ59OUTP1"
      >Question [59]</a
    >, <a href="SS059.html#SSQ59A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now it belongs to the
    order of justice that a man should obey his superior in those matters to
    which the rights of his authority extend. Again, the judge, as stated above
    (<a href="SS067.html#SSQ67OUTP1">Question [67]</a>,
    <a href="SS067.html#SSQ67A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), is the superior in
    relation to the person whom he judges. Therefore the accused is in duty
    bound to tell the judge the truth which the latter exacts from him according
    to the form of law. Hence if he refuse to tell the truth which he is under
    obligation to tell, or if he mendaciously deny it, he sins mortally. If, on
    the other hand, the judge asks of him that which he cannot ask in accordance
    with the order of justice, the accused is not bound to satisfy him, and he
    may lawfully escape by appealing or otherwise: but it is not lawful for him
    to lie.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When a man is examined by the judge
    according to the order of justice, he does not lay bare his own guilt, but
    his guilt is unmasked by another, since the obligation of answering is
    imposed on him by one whom he is bound to obey.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To lie, with injury to another person,
    in order to rescue a man from death is not a purely officious lie, for it
    has an admixture of the pernicious lie: and when a man lies in court in
    order to exculpate himself, he does an injury to one whom he is bound to
    obey, since he refuses him his due, namely an avowal of the truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He who lies in court by denying his
    guilt, acts both against the love of God to whom judgment belongs, and
    against the love of his neighbor, and this not only as regards the judge, to
    whom he refuses his due, but also as regards his accuser, who is punished if
    he fail to prove his accusation. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++140%3A4"
      >Ps. 140:4</a
    >): "Incline not my heart to evil words, to make excuses in sins": on which
    words a gloss says: "Shameless men are wont by lying to deny their guilt
    when they have been found out." And Gregory in expounding Job 31:33, "If as
    a man I have hid my sin," says (Moral. xxii, 15): "It is a common vice of
    mankind to sin in secret, by lying to hide the sin that has been committed,
    and when convicted to aggravate the sin by defending oneself."<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether it is lawful for the accused to defend himself with calumnies?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem lawful for the accused to defend
    himself with calumnies. Because, according to civil law (Cod. II, iv, De
    transact. 18), when a man is on trial for his life it is lawful for him to
    bribe his adversary. Now this is done chiefly by defending oneself with
    calumnies. Therefore the accused who is on trial for his life does not sin
    if he defend himself with calumnies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, an accuser who is guilty of collusion
    with the accused, is punishable by law (Decret. II, qu. iii, can. Si quem
    poenit.). Yet no punishment is imposed on the accused for collusion with the
    accuser. Therefore it would seem lawful for the accused to defend himself
    with calumnies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++14%3A16"
      >Prov. 14:16</a
    >): "A wise man feareth and declineth from evil, the fool leapeth over and
    is confident." Now what is done wisely is no sin. Therefore no matter how a
    man declines from evil, he does not sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> In criminal cases an oath has to be taken
    against calumnious allegations (Extra, De juramento calumniae, cap.
    Inhaerentes): and this would not be the case if it were lawful to defend
    oneself with calumnies. Therefore it is not lawful for the accused to defend
    himself with calumnies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is one thing to withhold the truth, and
    another to utter a falsehood. The former is lawful sometimes, for a man is
    not bound to divulge all truth, but only such as the judge can and must
    require of him according to the order of justice; as, for instance, when the
    accused is already disgraced through the commission of some crime, or
    certain indications of his guilt have already been discovered, or again when
    his guilt is already more or less proven. On the other hand it is never
    lawful to make a false declaration.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As regards what he may do lawfully, a man can employ either lawful means,
    and such as are adapted to the end in view, which belongs to prudence; or he
    can use unlawful means, unsuitable to the proposed end, and this belongs to
    craftiness, which is exercised by fraud and guile, as shown above (<a
      href="SS055.html#SSQ55OUTP1"
      >Question [55]</a
    >, <a href="SS055.html#SSQ55ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>, seqq.). His conduct in
    the former case is praiseworthy, in the latter sinful. Accordingly it is
    lawful for the accused to defend himself by withholding the truth that he is
    not bound to avow, by suitable means, for instance by not answering such
    questions as he is not bound to answer. This is not to defend himself with
    calumnies, but to escape prudently. But it is unlawful for him, either to
    utter a falsehood, or to withhold a truth that he is bound to avow, or to
    employ guile or fraud, because fraud and guile have the force of a lie, and
    so to use them would be to defend oneself with calumnies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Human laws leave many things unpunished,
    which according to the Divine judgment are sins, as, for example, simple
    fornication; because human law does not exact perfect virtue from man, for
    such virtue belongs to few and cannot be found in so great a number of
    people as human law has to direct. That a man is sometimes unwilling to
    commit a sin in order to escape from the death of the body, the danger of
    which threatens the accused who is on trial for his life, is an act of
    perfect virtue, since "death is the most fearful of all temporal things"
    (Ethic. iii, 6). Wherefore if the accused, who is on trial for his life,
    bribes his adversary, he sins indeed by inducing him to do what is unlawful,
    yet the civil law does not punish this sin, and in this sense it is said to
    be lawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If the accuser is guilty of collusion
    with the accused and the latter is guilty, he incurs punishment, and so it
    is evident that he sins. Wherefore, since it is a sin to induce a man to
    sin, or to take part in a sin in any way---for the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++1%3A32"
      >Rm. 1:32</a
    >), that "they... are worthy of death... that consent" to those who sin---it
    is evident that the accused also sins if he is guilty of collusion with his
    adversary. Nevertheless according to human laws no punishment is inflicted
    on him, for the reason given above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The wise man hides himself not by
    slandering others but by exercising prudence.<br />

    Whether it is lawful for the accused to escape judgment by appealing?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful for the accused to escape
    judgment by appealing. The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++13%3A1"
      >Rm. 13:1</a
    >): "Let every soul be subject to the higher powers." Now the accused by
    appealing refuses to be subject to a higher power, viz. the judge. Therefore
    he commits a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, ordinary authority is more binding than
    that which we choose for ourselves. Now according to the Decretals (II, qu.
    vi, cap. A judicibus) it is unlawful to appeal from the judges chosen by
    common consent. Much less therefore is it lawful to appeal from ordinary
    judges.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever is lawful once is always
    lawful. But it is not lawful to appeal after the tenth day [*Can.
    Anteriorum, caus. ii, qu. 6], nor a third time on the same point [*Can. Si
    autem, caus. ii, qu. 6]. Therefore it would seem that an appeal is unlawful
    in itself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Paul appealed to Caesar (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+25"
      >Acts 25</a
    >).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There are two motives for which a man appeals.
    First through confidence in the justice of his cause, seeing that he is
    unjustly oppressed by the judge, and then it is lawful for him to appeal,
    because this is a prudent means of escape. Hence it is laid down (Decret.
    II, qu. vi, can. Omnis oppressus): "All those who are oppressed are free, if
    they so wish, to appeal to the judgment of the priests, and no man may stand
    in their way." Secondly, a man appeals in order to cause a delay, lest a
    just sentence be pronounced against him. This is to defend oneself
    calumniously, and is unlawful as stated above (<a
      href="SS069.html#SSQ69A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). For he inflicts an injury both on the judge, whom he hinders in the
    exercise of his office, and on his adversary, whose justice he disturbs as
    far as he is able. Hence it is laid down (II, qu. vi, can. Omnino
    puniendus): "Without doubt a man should be punished if his appeal be
    declared unjust."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A man should submit to the lower
    authority in so far as the latter observes the order of the higher
    authority. If the lower authority departs from the order of the higher, we
    ought not to submit to it, for instance "if the proconsul order one thing
    and the emperor another," according to a gloss on Rm. 13:2. Now when a judge
    oppresses anyone unjustly, in this respect he departs from the order of the
    higher authority, whereby he is obliged to judge justly. Hence it is lawful
    for a man who is oppressed unjustly, to have recourse to the authority of
    the higher power, by appealing either before or after sentence has been
    pronounced. And since it is to be presumed that there is no rectitude where
    true faith is lacking, it is unlawful for a Catholic to appeal to an
    unbelieving judge, according to Decretals II, qu. vi, can. Catholicus: "The
    Catholic who appeals to the decision of a judge of another faith shall be
    excommunicated, whether his case be just or unjust." Hence the Apostle also
    rebuked those who went to law before unbelievers (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++6%3A6"
      >1 Cor. 6:6</a
    >).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is due to a man's own fault or
    neglect that, of his own accord, he submits to the judgment of one in whose
    justice he has no confidence. Moreover it would seem to point to levity of
    mind for a man not to abide by what he has once approved of. Hence it is
    with reason that the law refuses us the faculty of appealing from the
    decision of judges of our own choice, who have no power save by virtue of
    the consent of the litigants. On the other hand the authority of an ordinary
    judge depends, not on the consent of those who are subject to his judgment,
    but on the authority of the king or prince who appointed him. Hence, as a
    remedy against his unjust oppression, the law allows one to have recourse to
    appeal, so that even if the judge be at the same time ordinary and chosen by
    the litigants, it is lawful to appeal from his decision, since seemingly his
    ordinary authority occasioned his being chosen as arbitrator. Nor is it to
    be imputed as a fault to the man who consented to his being arbitrator,
    without adverting to the fact that he was appointed ordinary judge by the
    prince.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The equity of the law so guards the
    interests of the one party that the other is not oppressed. Thus it allows
    ten days for appeal to be made, this being considered sufficient time for
    deliberating on the expediency of an appeal. If on the other hand there were
    no fixed time limit for appealing, the certainty of judgment would ever be
    in suspense, so that the other party would suffer an injury. The reason why
    it is not allowed to appeal a third time on the same point, is that it is
    not probable that the judges would fail to judge justly so many times.<br />

    Whether a man who is condemned to death may lawfully defend himself if he
    can?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man who is condemned to
    death may lawfully defend himself if he can. For it is always lawful to do
    that to which nature inclines us, as being of natural right, so to speak.
    Now, to resist corruption is an inclination of nature not only in men and
    animals but also in things devoid of sense. Therefore if he can do so, the
    accused, after condemnation, may lawfully resist being put to death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as a man, by resistance, escapes
    the death to which he has been condemned, so does he by flight. Now it is
    lawful seemingly to escape death by flight, according to Ecclus. 9:18, "Keep
    thee far from the man that hath power to kill [and not to quicken]" [*The
    words in the brackets are not in the Vulgate]. Therefore it is also lawful
    for the accused to resist.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++24%3A11"
      >Prov. 24:11</a
    >): "Deliver them that are led to death: and those that are drawn to death
    forbear not to deliver." Now a man is under greater obligation to himself
    than to another. Therefore it is lawful for a condemned man to defend
    himself from being put to death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++13%3A2"
      >Rm. 13:2</a
    >): "He that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they
    that resist, purchase to themselves damnation." Now a condemned man, by
    defending himself, resists the power in the point of its being ordained by
    God "for the punishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of the good" [*1
    Pt. 2:14]. Therefore he sins in defending himself.<br />

    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A man may be condemned to death in two ways.
    First justly, and then it is not lawful for the condemned to defend himself,
    because it is lawful for the judge to combat his resistance by force, so
    that on his part the fight is unjust, and consequently without any doubt he
    sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly a man is condemned unjustly: and such a sentence is like the
    violence of robbers, according to Ezech. 22:21, "Her princes in the midst of
    her are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood." Wherefore even as it
    is lawful to resist robbers, so is it lawful, in a like case, to resist
    wicked princes; except perhaps in order to avoid scandal, whence some grave
    disturbance might be feared to arise.<br />
  </p>

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Reason was given to man that he might
    ensue those things to which his nature inclines, not in all cases, but in
    accordance with the order of reason. Hence not all self-defense is lawful,
    but only such as is accomplished with due moderation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When a man is condemned to death, he has
    not to kill himself, but to suffer death: wherefore he is not bound to do
    anything from which death would result, such as to stay in the place whence
    he would be led to execution. But he may not resist those who lead him to
    death, in order that he may not suffer what is just for him to suffer. Even
    so, if a man were condemned to die of hunger, he does not sin if he partakes
    of food brought to him secretly, because to refrain from taking it would be
    to kill himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This saying of the wise man does not
    direct that one should deliver a man from death in opposition to the order
    of justice: wherefore neither should a man deliver himself from death by
    resisting against justice.<br />
