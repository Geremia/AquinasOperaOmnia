<br>
OF THE INJUSTICE OF A JUDGE, IN JUDGING (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider those vices opposed to commutative justice, that 
consist in words injurious to our neighbors. We shall consider (1) those 
which are connected with judicial proceedings, and (2) injurious words 
uttered extra-judicially.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] Out. Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head five points occur for our consideration: (1) The 
injustice of a judge in judging; (2) The injustice of the prosecutor in 
accusing; (3) The injustice of the defendant in defending himself; (4) 
The injustice of the witnesses in giving evidence; (5) The injustice of 
the advocate in defending.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] Out. Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS067.html#SSQ67A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a man can justly judge one who is not his subject?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS067.html#SSQ67A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is lawful for a judge, on account of the evidence, to 
deliver judgment in opposition to the truth which is known to him?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS067.html#SSQ67A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether a judge can justly sentence a man who is not accused?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS067.html#SSQ67A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether he can justly remit the punishment?

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man can justly judge one who is not subject to his jurisdiction?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man can justly judge one who is not subject 
to his jurisdiction. For it is stated (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dan++13">Dan. 13</a>) that Daniel sentenced the 
ancients who were convicted of bearing false witness. But these ancients 
were not subject to Daniel; indeed they were judges of the people. 
Therefore a man may lawfully judge one that is not subject to his 
jurisdiction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ was no man's subject, indeed He was "King of 
kings and Lord of lords" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rev+++19%3A16">Apoc. 19:16</a>). Yet He submitted to the judgment 
of a man. Therefore it seems that a man may lawfully judge one that is 
not subject to his jurisdiction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to the law [*Cap. Licet ratione, de Foro 
Comp.] a man is tried in this or that court according to his kind of 
offense. Now sometimes the defendant is not the subject of the man whose 
business it is to judge in that particular place, for instance when the 
defendant belongs to another diocese or is exempt. Therefore it seems 
that a man may judge one that is not his subject.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory [*Regist. xi, epist. 64] in commenting on Dt. 
23:25, "If thou go into thy friend's corn," etc. says: "Thou mayest not 
put the sickle of judgment to the corn that is entrusted to another."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A judge's sentence is like a particular law regarding 
some particular fact. Wherefore just as a general law should have 
coercive power, as the Philosopher states (Ethic. x, 9), so too the 
sentence of a judge should have coercive power, whereby either party is 
compelled to comply with the judge's sentence; else the judgment would be 
of no effect. Now coercive power is not exercised in human affairs, save 
by those who hold public authority: and those who have this authority are 
accounted the superiors of those over whom they preside whether by 
ordinary or by delegated authority. Hence it is evident that no man can 
judge others than his subjects and this in virtue either of delegated or 
of ordinary authority.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In judging those ancients Daniel exercised an authority 
delegated to him by Divine instinct. This is indicated where it is said 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dan++13%3A45">Dan. 13:45</a>) that "the Lord raised up the . . . spirit of a young boy."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In human affairs a man may submit of his own accord to the 
judgment of others although these be not his superiors, an example of 
which is when parties agree to a settlement by arbitrators. Wherefore it 
is necessary that the arbitrator should be upheld by a penalty, since the 
arbitrators through not exercising authority in the case, have not of 
themselves full power of coercion. Accordingly in this way did Christ of 
his own accord submit to human judgment: and thus too did Pope Leo [*Leo 
IV] submit to the judgment of the emperor [*Can. Nos si incompetenter, 
caus. ii, qu. 7].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The bishop of the defendant's diocese becomes the latter's 
superior as regards the fault committed, even though he be exempt: unless 
perchance the defendant offend in a matter exempt from the bishop's 
authority, for instance in administering the property of an exempt 
monastery. But if an exempt person commits a theft, or a murder or the 
like, he may be justly condemned by the ordinary.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is lawful for a judge to pronounce judgment against the truth that he knows, on account of evidence to the contrary?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful for a judge to pronounce judgment against 
the truth that he knows, on account of evidence to the contrary. For it 
is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++17%3A9">Dt. 17:9</a>): "Thou shalt come to the priests of the Levitical 
race, and to the judge that shall be at that time; and thou shalt ask of 
them, and they shall show thee the truth of the judgment." Now sometimes 
certain things are alleged against the truth, as when something is proved 
by means of false witnesses. Therefore it is unlawful for a judge to 
pronounce  judgment according to what is alleged and proved in opposition 
to the truth which he knows.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in pronouncing judgment a man should conform to the 
Divine judgment, since "it is the judgment of God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++1%3A17">Dt. 1:17</a>). Now "the 
judgment of God is according to the truth" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++2%3A2">Rm. 2:2</a>), and it was foretold 
of Christ (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++11%3A3,4">Is. 11:3,4</a>): "He shall not judge according to the sight of the 
eyes, nor reprove according to the hearing of the ears. But He shall 
judge the poor with justice, and shall reprove with equity for the meek 
of the earth." Therefore the judge ought not to pronounce judgment 
according to the evidence before him if it be contrary to what he knows 
himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the reason why evidence is required in a court of law, 
is that the judge may have a faithful record of the truth of the matter, 
wherefore in matters of common knowledge there is no need of judicial 
procedure, according to 1 Tim. 5:24, "Some men's sins are manifest, going 
before to judgment." Consequently, if the judge by his personal knowledge 
is aware of the truth, he should pay no heed to the evidence, but should 
pronounce sentence according to the truth which he knows.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the word "conscience" denotes application of knowledge 
to a matter of action as stated in the FP, Question [79], Article [13]. Now it is a sin 
to act contrary to one's knowledge. Therefore a judge sins if he 
pronounces sentence according to the evidence but against his conscience 
of the truth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine [*Ambrose, Super Ps. 118, serm. 20] says in 
his commentary on the Psalter: "A good judge does nothing according to 
his private opinion but pronounces sentence according to the law and the 
right." Now this is to pronounce judgment according to what is alleged 
and proved in court. Therefore a judge ought to pronounce judgment in 
accordance with these things, and not according to his private opinion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS067.html#SSQ67A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="SS060.html#SSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>, <A Href="SS060.html#SSQ60ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,6) it is the duty of 
a judge to pronounce judgment in as much as he exercises public 
authority, wherefore his judgment should be based on information acquired 
by him, not from his knowledge as a private individual, but from what he 
knows as a public person. Now the latter knowledge comes to him both in 
general and in particular ---in general through the public laws, whether 
Divine or human, and he should admit no evidence that conflicts 
therewith---in some particular matter, through documents and witnesses, 
and other legal means of information, which in pronouncing his sentence, 
he ought to follow rather than the information he has acquired as a 
private individual. And yet this same information may be of use to him, 
so that he can more rigorously sift the evidence brought forward, and 
discover its weak points. If, however, he is unable to reject that 
evidence juridically, he must, as stated above, follow it in pronouncing 
sentence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The reason why, in the passage quoted, it is  stated that 
the judges should first of all be asked their reasons, is to make it 
clear that the judges ought to judge the truth in accordance with the 
evidence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To judge belongs to God in virtue of His own power: 
wherefore His judgment is based on the truth which He Himself knows, and 
not on knowledge imparted by others: the same is to be said of Christ, 
Who is true God and true man: whereas other judges do not judge in virtue 
of their own power, so that there is no comparison.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Apostle refers to the case where something is well 
known not to the judge alone, but both to him and to others, so that the 
guilty party can by no means deny his guilt (as in the case of notorious 
criminals), and is convicted at once from the evidence of the fact. If, 
on the other hand, it be well known to the judge, but not to others, or 
to others, but not to the judge, then it is necessary for the judge to 
sift the evidence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In matters touching his own person, a man must form his 
conscience from his own knowledge, but in matters concerning the public 
authority, he must form his conscience in accordance with the knowledge 
attainable in the public judicial procedure.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a judge may condemn a man who is not accused?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a judge may pass sentence on a man who is not 
accused. For human justice is derived from Divine justice. Now God judges 
the sinner even though there be no accuser. Therefore it seems that a man 
may pass sentence of condemnation on a man even though there be no 
accuser.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, an accuser is required in judicial procedure in order 
that he may relate the crime to the judge. Now sometimes the crime may 
come to the judge's knowledge otherwise than by accusation; for instance, 
by denunciation, or by evil report, or through the judge himself being an 
eye-witness. Therefore a judge may condemn a man without there being an 
accuser.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the deeds of holy persons are related in Holy Writ, as 
models of human conduct. Now Daniel was at the same time the accuser and 
the judge of the wicked ancients (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dan++13">Dan. 13</a>). Therefore it is not contrary 
to justice for a man to condemn anyone as judge while being at the same 
time his accuser.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose in his commentary on 1 Cor. 5:2, expounding the 
Apostle's sentence on the fornicator, says that "a judge should not 
condemn without an accuser, since our Lord did not banish Judas, who was 
a thief, yet was not accused."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A judge is an interpreter of justice. Wherefore, as the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 4), "men have  recourse to a judge as to one 
who is the personification of justice." Now, as stated above (<A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), justice is not between a man and himself but between one man and 
another. Hence a judge must needs judge between two parties, which is the 
case when one is the prosecutor, and the other the defendant. Therefore 
in criminal cases the judge cannot sentence a man unless the latter has 
an accuser, according to Acts 25:16: "It is not the custom of the Romans 
to condemn any man, before that he who is accused have his accusers 
present, and have liberty to make his answer, to clear himself of the 
crimes" of which he is accused.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God, in judging man, takes the sinner's conscience as his 
accuser, according to Rm. 2:15, "Their thoughts between themselves 
accusing, or also defending one another"; or again, He takes the evidence 
of the fact as regards the deed itself, according to Gn. 4:10, "The voice 
of thy brother's blood crieth to Me from the earth."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Public disgrace takes the place of an accuser. Hence a 
gloss on Gn. 4:10, "The voice of thy brother's blood," etc. says: "There 
is no need of an accuser when the crime committed is notorious." In a 
case of denunciation, as stated above (<A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS033.html#SSQ33OUTP1">Question [33]</a>, <A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS033.html#SSQ33A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), the amendment, not 
the punishment, of the sinner is intended: wherefore when a man is 
denounced for a sin, nothing is done against him, but for him, so that no 
accuser is required. The punishment that is inflicted is on account of 
his rebellion against the Church, and since this rebellion is manifest, 
it stands instead of an accuser. The fact that the judge himself was an 
eye-witness, does not authorize him to proceed to pass sentence, except 
according to the order of judicial procedure.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God, in judging man, proceeds from His own knowledge of the 
truth, whereas man does not, as stated above (<A Href="SS067.html#SSQ67A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Hence a man cannot 
be accuser, witness and judge at the same time, as God is. Daniel was at 
once accuser and judge, because he was the executor of the sentence of 
God, by whose instinct he was moved, as stated above (<A Href="SS067.html#SSQ67A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the judge can lawfully remit the punishment?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the judge can lawfully remit the punishment. 
For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+2%3A13">James 2:13</a>): "Judgment without mercy" shall be done 
"to him that hath not done mercy." Now no man is punished for not doing 
what he cannot do lawfully. Therefore any judge can lawfully do mercy by 
remitting the punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, human judgment should imitate the Divine judgment. Now 
God remits the punishment to sinners, because He desires not the death of 
the sinner, according to Ezech. 18:23. Therefore a human judge also may 
lawfully remit the punishment to one who repents.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is lawful for anyone to do what is  profitable to 
some one and harmful to none. Now the remission of his punishment profits 
the guilty man and harms nobody. Therefore the judge can lawfully loose a 
guilty man from his punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++13%3A8,9">Dt. 13:8,9</a>) concerning anyone who would 
persuade a man to serve strange gods: "Neither let thy eye spare him to 
pity and conceal him, but thou shalt presently put him to death": and of 
the murderer it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++19%3A12,13">Dt. 19:12,13</a>): "He shall die. Thou shalt not 
pity him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[67] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As may be gathered from what has been said (<A Href="SS067.html#SSQ67ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3), 
with regard to the question in point, two things may be observed in 
connection with a judge. One is that he has to judge between accuser and 
defendant, while the other is that he pronounces the judicial sentence, 
in virtue of his power, not as a private individual but as a public 
person. Accordingly on two counts a judge is hindered from loosing a 
guilty person from his punishment. First on the part of the accuser, 
whose right it sometimes is that the guilty party should be 
punished---for instance on account of some injury committed against the 
accuser---because it is not in the power of a judge to remit such 
punishment, since every judge is bound to give each man his right. 
Secondly, he finds a hindrance on the part of the commonwealth, whose 
power he exercises, and to whose good it belongs that evil-doers should 
be punished.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless in this respect there is a difference between judges of 
lower degree and the supreme judge, i.e. the sovereign, to whom the 
entire public authority is entrusted. For the inferior judge has no power 
to exempt a guilty man from punishment against the laws imposed on him by 
his superior. Wherefore Augustine in commenting on John 19:11, "Thou 
shouldst not have any power against Me," says (Tract. cxvi in Joan.): 
"The power which God gave Pilate was such that he was under the power of 
Caesar, so that he was by no means free to acquit the person accused." On 
the other hand the sovereign who has full authority in the commonwealth, 
can lawfully remit the punishment to a guilty person, provided the 
injured party consent to the remission, and that this do not seem 
detrimental to the public good.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There is a place for the judge's mercy in matters that are 
left to the judge's discretion, because in like matters a good man is 
slow to punish as the Philosopher states (Ethic. v, 10). But in matters 
that are determined in accordance with Divine or human laws, it is not 
left to him to show mercy.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God has supreme power of judging, and it concerns Him 
whatever is done sinfully against anyone. Therefore He is free to remit 
the punishment, especially since punishment is due to sin chiefly because 
it is done against Him. He does not, however, remit the punishment, 
except in so far as it becomes His goodness, which is the source of all 
laws.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If the judge were to remit punishment  inordinately, he 
would inflict an injury on the community, for whose good it behooves 
ill-deeds to be punished, in order that. men may avoid sin. Hence the 
text, after appointing the punishment of the seducer, adds (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++13%3A11">Dt. 13:11</a>): 
"That all Israel hearing may fear, and may do no more anything like 
this." He would also inflict harm on the injured person; who is 
compensated by having his honor restored in the punishment of the man who 
has injured him.<br>
