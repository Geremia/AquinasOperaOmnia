<br>
OF HOPE, CONSIDERED IN ITSELF (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After treating of faith, we must consider hope and (1) hope itself; (2) 
the gift of fear; (3) the contrary vices; (4) the corresponding precepts. 
The first of these points gives rise to a twofold consideration: (1) 
hope, considered in itself; (2) its subject.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether hope is a virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether its object is eternal happiness?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether, by the virtue of hope, one man may hope for another's 
happiness?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether a man may lawfully hope in man?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether hope is a theological virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A6THEP1">(6)</a> Of its distinction from the other theological virtues?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A7THEP1">(7)</a> Of its relation to faith; 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A8THEP1">(8)</a> Of its relation to charity.

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that hope is not a virtue. For "no man makes ill 
use of a virtue," as Augustine states (De Lib. Arb. ii, 18). But one may 
make ill use of hope, since the passion of hope, like the other passions, 
is subject to a mean and extremes. Therefore hope is not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no virtue results from merits, since "God works virtue 
in us without us," as Augustine states (De Grat. et Lib. Arb. xvii). But 
hope is caused by grace and merits, according to the Master (Sent. iii, 
D, 26). Therefore hope is not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "virtue is the disposition of a perfect thing" (Phys. 
vii, text. 17,18). But hope is the disposition of an imperfect thing, of 
one, namely, that lacks what it hopes to have. Therefore hope is not a 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. i, 33) that the three daughters of 
Job signify these three virtues, faith, hope and charity. Therefore hope 
is a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 6) "the virtue 
of a thing is that which makes its subject good, and its work good 
likewise." Consequently wherever we find a good human act, it must 
correspond to some human virtue. Now in all things measured and ruled, 
the good is that which attains its proper rule: thus we say that a coat 
is good if it neither exceeds nor falls short of its proper measurement. 
But, as we stated above (<A Href="SS008.html#SSQ8OUTP1">Question [8]</a>, <A Href="SS008.html#SSQ8A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 3) human acts have a twofold 
measure; one is proximate and homogeneous, viz. the reason, while the 
other is remote and excelling, viz. God: wherefore every human act is 
good, which attains reason or God Himself. Now the act of hope, whereof 
we speak now, attains God. For, as we have already stated (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), when we were treating of the passion of hope, the object of hope 
is a future good, difficult but possible to obtain. Now a thing is 
possible to us in two ways: first, by ourselves; secondly, by means of 
others, as stated in Ethic. iii. Wherefore, in so far as we hope for 
anything as being possible to us by means of the Divine assistance, our 
hope attains God Himself, on Whose help it leans. It is therefore evident 
that hope is a virtue, since it causes a human act to be good and to 
attain its due rule.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the passions, the mean of virtue depends on right reason 
being attained, wherein also consists the essence of virtue. Wherefore in 
hope too, the good of virtue depends on a man's attaining, by hoping, the 
due rule, viz. God. Consequently man cannot make ill use of hope which 
attains God, as neither can he make ill use of moral virtue which attains 
the reason, because to attain thus is to make good use of virtue. 
Nevertheless, the hope of which we speak now, is not a passion but a 
habit of the  mind, as we shall show further on (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="SS018.html#SSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="SS018.html#SSQ18A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Hope is said to arise from merits, as regards the thing 
hoped for, in so far as we hope to obtain happiness by means of grace and 
merits; or as regards the act of living hope. The habit itself of hope, 
whereby we hope to obtain happiness, does not flow from our merits, but 
from grace alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He who hopes is indeed imperfect in relation to that which 
he hopes to obtain, but has not as yet; yet he is perfect, in so far as 
he already attains his proper rule, viz. God, on Whose help he leans.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether eternal happiness is the proper object of hope?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that eternal happiness is not the proper object of 
hope. For a man does not hope for that which surpasses every movement of 
the soul, since hope itself is a movement of the soul. Now eternal 
happiness surpasses every movement of the human soul, for the Apostle 
says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++2:9">1 Cor. 2:9</a>) that it hath not "entered into the heart of man." 
Therefore happiness is not the proper object of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prayer is an expression of hope, for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++36:5">Ps. 36:5</a>): "Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in Him, and He will do it." 
Now it is lawful for man to pray God not only for eternal happiness, but 
also for the goods, both temporal and spiritual, of the present life, 
and, as evidenced by the Lord's Prayer, to be delivered from evils which 
will no longer be in eternal happiness. Therefore eternal happiness is 
not the proper object of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the object of hope is something difficult. Now many 
things besides eternal happiness are difficult to man. Therefore eternal 
happiness is not the proper object of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++6:19">Heb. 6:19</a>) that we have hope "which 
entereth in," i.e. maketh us to enter . . . "within the veil," i.e. into 
the happiness of heaven, according to the interpretation of a gloss on 
these words. Therefore the object of hope is eternal happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the hope of which we speak now, 
attains God by leaning on His help in order to obtain the hoped for good. 
Now an effect must be proportionate to its cause. Wherefore the good 
which we ought to hope for from God properly and chiefly is the infinite 
good, which is proportionate to the power of our divine helper, since it 
belongs to an infinite power to lead anyone to an infinite good. Such a 
good is eternal life, which consists in the enjoyment of God Himself. For 
we should hope from Him for nothing less than Himself, since His 
goodness, whereby He imparts good things to His creature, is no less than 
His Essence. Therefore the proper and principal object of hope is  
eternal happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Eternal happiness does not enter into the heart of man 
perfectly, i.e. so that it be possible for a wayfarer to know its nature 
and quality; yet, under the general notion of the perfect good, it is 
possible for it to be apprehended by a man, and it is in this way that 
the movement of hope towards it arises. Hence the Apostle says pointedly 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++6:19">Heb. 6:19</a>) that hope "enters in, even within the veil," because that 
which we hope for is as yet veiled, so to speak.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> We ought not to pray God for any other goods, except in 
reference to eternal happiness. Hence hope regards eternal happiness 
chiefly, and other things, for which we pray God, it regards secondarily 
and as referred to eternal happiness: just as faith regards God 
principally, and, secondarily, those things which are referred to God, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To him that longs for something great, all lesser things 
seem small; wherefore to him that hopes for eternal happiness, nothing 
else appears arduous, as compared with that hope; although, as compared 
with the capability of the man who hopes, other things besides may be 
arduous to him, so that he may have hope for such things in reference to 
its principal object.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one may hope for another's eternal happiness. 
For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++1:6">Phil. 1:6</a>): "Being confident of this very thing, 
that He Who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it unto the day 
of Jesus Christ." Now the perfection of that day will be eternal 
happiness. Therefore one man may hope for another's eternal happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever we ask of God, we hope to obtain from Him. But 
we ask God to bring others to eternal happiness, according to James 5:16: 
"Pray for one another that you may be saved." Therefore we can hope for 
another's eternal happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, hope and despair are about the same object. Now it is 
possible to despair of another's eternal happiness, else Augustine would 
have no reason for saying (De Verb. Dom., Serm. lxxi) that we should not 
despair of anyone so long as he lives. Therefore one can also hope for 
another's eternal salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Enchiridion viii) that "hope is only of 
such things as belong to him who is supposed to hope for them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We can hope for something in two ways: first, absolutely, 
and thus the object of hope is always something arduous and pertaining to 
the person who hopes. Secondly, we can hope for something, through 
something else being presupposed, and in this  way its object can be 
something pertaining to someone else. In order to explain this we must 
observe that love and hope differ in this, that love denotes union 
between lover and beloved, while hope denotes a movement or a stretching 
forth of the appetite towards an arduous good. Now union is of things 
that are distinct, wherefore love can directly regard the other whom a 
man unites to himself by love, looking upon him as his other self: 
whereas movement is always towards its own term which is proportionate to 
the subject moved. Therefore hope regards directly one's own good, and 
not that which pertains to another. Yet if we presuppose the union of 
love with another, a man can hope for and desire something for another 
man, as for himself; and, accordingly, he can hope for another eternal's 
life, inasmuch as he is united to him by love, and just as it is the same 
virtue of charity whereby a man loves God, himself, and his neighbor, so 
too it is the same virtue of hope, whereby a man hopes for himself and 
for another.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It wold seem that one may lawfully hope in man. For the object of 
hope is eternal happiness. Now we are helped to obtain eternal happiness 
by the patronage of the saints, for Gregory says (Dial. i, 8) that 
"predestination is furthered by the saints' prayers." Therefore one may 
hope in man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if a man may not hope in another man, it ought not to be 
reckoned a sin in a man, that one should not be able to hope in him. Yet 
this is reckoned a vice in some, as appears from Jer. 9:4: "Let every man 
take heed of his neighbor, and let him not trust in any brother of his." 
Therefore it is lawful to trust in a man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, prayer is the expression of hope, as stated above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, Objection [2]). But it is lawful to pray to a man for something. Therefore it is 
lawful to trust in him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++17:5">Jer. 17:5</a>): "Cursed be the man that 
trusteth in man."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Hope, as stated above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), regards 
two things, viz. the good which it intends to obtain, and the help by 
which that good is obtained. Now the good which a man hopes to obtain, 
has the aspect of a final cause, while the help by which one hopes to 
obtain that good, has the character of an efficient cause. Now in each of 
these kinds of cause we find a principal and a secondary cause. For the 
principal end is the last end, while the secondary end is that which is 
referred to an end. In like manner the principal efficient cause is the 
first agent, while the secondary efficient cause is the secondary and 
instrumental agent. Now hope regards eternal happiness as its last end, 
and the Divine assistance as the first cause leading to  happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, just as it is not lawful to hope for any good save 
happiness, as one's last end, but only as something referred to final 
happiness, so too, it is unlawful to hope in any man, or any creature, as 
though it were the first cause of movement towards happiness. It is, 
however, lawful to hope in a man or a creature as being the secondary and 
instrumental agent through whom one is helped to obtain any goods that 
are ordained to happiness. It is in this way that we turn to the saints, 
and that we ask men also for certain things; and for this reason some are 
blamed in that they cannot be trusted to give help.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, expectation belongs to longanimity which is a species of 
fortitude. Since, then, hope is a kind of expectation, it seems that hope 
is not a theological, but a moral virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[5] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the object of hope is something arduous. But it belongs 
to magnanimity, which is a moral virtue, to tend to the arduous. 
Therefore hope is a moral, and not a theological virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Hope is enumerated (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13">1 Cor. 13</a>) together with faith and 
charity, which are theological virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since specific differences, by their very nature, divide 
a genus, in order to decide under what division we must place hope, we 
must observe whence it derives its character of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it has been stated above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that hope has the character of 
virtue from the fact that it attains the supreme rule of human actions: 
and this it attains both as its first efficient cause, in as much as it 
leans on its assistance, and as its last final cause, in as much as it 
expects happiness in the enjoyment thereof. Hence it is evident that God 
is the principal object of hope, considered as a virtue. Since, then, the 
very idea of a theological virtue is one that has God for its object, as 
stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it is evident that hope is a theological 
virtue. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Whatever else hope expects to obtain, it hopes for it in 
reference to God as the last end, or as the first efficient cause, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In things measured and ruled the mean consists in the 
measure or rule being attained; if we go beyond the rule, there is 
excess, if we fall short of the rule, there is deficiency. But in the 
rule or measure itself there is no such thing as a mean or extremes. Now 
a moral virtue is concerned with things ruled by reason, and these things 
are its proper object; wherefore it is proper to it to follow the mean as 
regards its proper object. On the other hand, a theological virtue is 
concerned with the First Rule not ruled by another rule, and that Rule is 
its proper object. Wherefore it is not proper for a theological virtue, 
with regard to its proper object, to follow the mean, although this may 
happen to it accidentally with regard to something that is referred to 
its principal object. Thus faith can have no mean or extremes in the 
point of trusting to the First Truth, in which it is impossible to trust 
too much; whereas on the part of the things believed, it may have a mean 
and extremes; for instance one truth is a mean between two falsehoods. So 
too, hope has no mean or extremes, as regards its principal object, since 
it is impossible to trust too much in the Divine assistance; yet it may 
have a mean and extremes, as regards those things a man trusts to obtain, 
in so far as he either presumes above his capability, or despairs of 
things of which he is capable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The expectation which is mentioned in the definition of 
hope does not imply delay, as does the expectation which belongs to 
longanimity. It implies a reference to the Divine assistance, whether 
that which we hope for be delayed or not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Magnanimity tends to something arduous in the hope of 
obtaining something that is within one's power, wherefore its proper 
object is the doing of great things. On the other hand hope, as a 
theological virtue, regards something arduous, to be obtained by 
another's help, as stated above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that hope is not distinct from the other 
theological virtues. For habits are distinguished by their objects, as 
stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54OUTP1">Question [54]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now the object of hope is the same as of 
the other theological virtues. Therefore hope is not distinct from the 
other theological virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the symbol of faith, whereby we make profession of 
faith, we say: "I expect the resurrection of the dead and the life of the 
world to come." Now expectation of future happiness belongs to hope, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore hope is not distinct from faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by hope man tends to God. But this belongs properly to 
charity. Therefore hope is not distinct from charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> There cannot be number without distinction. Now hope is 
numbered with the other theological virtues: for Gregory says (Moral. i, 
16) that the three virtues are faith, hope, and charity. Therefore hope 
is distinct from the theological virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A virtue is said to be theological from having God for 
the object to which it adheres. Now one may adhere to a thing in two 
ways: first, for its own sake; secondly, because something else is 
attained thereby. Accordingly charity makes us adhere to God for His own 
sake, uniting our minds to God by the emotion of love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, hope and faith make man adhere to God as to a 
principle wherefrom certain things accrue to us. Now we derive from God 
both knowledge of truth and the attainment of perfect goodness. 
Accordingly faith makes us adhere to God, as the source whence we derive 
the knowledge of truth, since we believe that what God tells us is true: 
while hope makes us adhere to God, as the source whence we derive perfect 
goodness, i.e. in so far as, by hope, we trust to the Divine assistance 
for obtaining happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God is the object of these virtues under different aspects, 
as stated above: and a different aspect of the object suffices for the 
distinction of habits, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54OUTP1">Question [54]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Expectation is mentioned in the symbol of faith, not as 
though it were the proper act of faith, but because the act of hope 
presupposes the act of faith, as we shall state further on (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Hence 
an act of faith is expressed in the act of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Hope makes us tend to God, as to a good to be obtained 
finally, and as to a helper strong to assist: whereas charity, properly 
speaking, makes us tend to God, by uniting our affections to Him, so that 
we live, not for ourselves, but for God.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that hope precedes faith. Because a gloss on Ps. 
36:3, "Trust in the Lord, and do good," says: "Hope is the entrance to 
faith and the beginning of salvation." But salvation is by faith whereby 
we are justified. Therefore hope precedes faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which is included in a definition should precede 
the thing defined and be more known. But hope is included in the 
definition of faith (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++11:1">Heb. 11:1</a>): "Faith is the substance of things to be 
hoped for." Therefore hope precedes faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, hope precedes a meritorious act, for the  Apostle says 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++9:10">1 Cor. 9:10</a>): "He that plougheth should plough in hope . . . to receive 
fruit." But the act of faith is meritorious. Therefore hope precedes 
faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++1:2">Mt. 1:2</a>): "Abraham begot Isaac," i.e. 
"Faith begot hope," according to a gloss.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Absolutely speaking, faith precedes hope. For the object 
of hope is a future good, arduous but possible to obtain. In order, 
therefore, that we may hope, it is necessary for the object of hope to be 
proposed to us as possible. Now the object of hope is, in one way, 
eternal happiness, and in another way, the Divine assistance, as 
explained above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A2A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 3): and both of these are proposed to us 
by faith, whereby we come to know that we are able to obtain eternal 
life, and that for this purpose the Divine assistance is ready for us, 
according to Heb. 11:6: "He that cometh to God, must believe that He is, 
and is a rewarder to them that seek Him." Therefore it is evident that 
faith precedes hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As the same gloss observes further on, "hope" is called 
"the entrance" to faith, i.e. of the thing believed, because by hope we 
enter in to see what we believe. Or we may reply that it is called the 
"entrance to faith," because thereby man begins to be established and 
perfected in faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The thing to be hoped for is included in the definition of 
faith, because the proper object of faith, is something not apparent in 
itself. Hence it was necessary to express it in a circumlocution by 
something resulting from faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Hope does not precede every meritorious act; but it 
suffices for it to accompany or follow it.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether charity precedes hope?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity precedes hope. For Ambrose says on Lk. 
27:6, "If you had faith like to a grain of mustard seed," etc.: "Charity 
flows from faith, and hope from charity." But faith precedes charity. 
Therefore charity precedes hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 9) that "good emotions 
and affections proceed from love and holy charity." Now to hope, 
considered as an act of hope, is a good emotion of the soul. Therefore it 
flows from charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Master says (Sent. iii, D, 26) that hope proceeds 
from merits, which precede not only the thing hoped for, but also hope 
itself, which, in the order of nature, is preceded by charity. Therefore 
charity precedes hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++1:5">1 Tim. 1:5</a>): "The end of the 
commandment is charity from a pure heart, and a good conscience," i.e. 
"from hope," according to a gloss. Therefore hope  precedes charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[8] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Order is twofold. One is the order of generation and of 
matter, in respect of which the imperfect precedes the perfect: the other 
is the order of perfection and form, in respect of which the perfect 
naturally precedes the imperfect. In respect of the first order hope 
precedes charity: and this is clear from the fact that hope and all 
movements of the appetite flow from love, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS027.html#FSQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS027.html#FSQ27A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS028.html#FSQ28OUTP1">Question [28]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS028.html#FSQ28A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 2; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>) in the treatise on the 
passions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[8] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now there is a perfect, and an imperfect love. Perfect love is that 
whereby a man is loved in himself, as when someone wishes a person some 
good for his own sake; thus a man loves his friend. Imperfect love is 
that whereby a man love something, not for its own sake, but that he may 
obtain that good for himself; thus a man loves what he desires. The first 
love of God pertains to charity, which adheres to God for His own sake; 
while hope pertains to the second love, since he that hopes, intends to 
obtain possession of something for himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[8] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence in the order of generation, hope precedes charity. For just as a 
man is led to love God, through fear of being punished by Him for his 
sins, as Augustine states (In primam canon. Joan. Tract. ix), so too, 
hope leads to charity, in as much as a man through hoping to be rewarded 
by God, is encouraged to love God and obey His commandments. On the other 
hand, in the order of perfection charity naturally precedes hope, 
wherefore, with the advent of charity, hope is made more perfect, because 
we hope chiefly in our friends. It is in this sense that Ambrose states 
(Objection [1]) that charity flows from hope: so that this suffices for the 
Reply to the First Objection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Hope and every movement of the appetite proceed from some 
kind of love, whereby the expected good is loved. But not every kind of 
hope proceeds from charity, but only the movement of living hope, viz. 
that whereby man hopes to obtain good from God, as from a friend.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[17] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Master is speaking of living hope, which is naturally 
preceded by charity and the merits caused by charity.<br>
