    Whether virginity consists in integrity of the flesh?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that virginity does not consist in
    integrity of the flesh. For Augustine says (De Nup. et Concup.) [*The
    quotation is from De Sancta Virgin. xiii] that "virginity is the continual
    meditation on incorruption in a corruptible flesh." But meditation does not
    concern the flesh. Therefore virginity is not situated in the flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, virginity denotes a kind of purity. Now
    Augustine says (De Civ. Dei i, 18) that "purity dwells in the soul."
    Therefore virginity is not incorruption of the flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the integrity of the flesh would seem to
    consist in the seal of virginal purity. Yet sometimes the seal is broken
    without loss of virginity. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei i, 18) that
    "those organs may be injured through being wounded by mischance. Physicians,
    too, sometimes do for the sake of health that which makes one shudder to
    see: and a midwife has been known to destroy by touch the proof of virginity
    that she sought." And he adds: "Nobody, I think, would be so foolish as to
    deem this maiden to have forfeited even bodily sanctity, though she lost the
    integrity of that organ." Therefore virginity does not consist in
    incorruption of the flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, corruption of the flesh consists chiefly
    in resolution of the semen: and this may take place without copulation,
    whether one be asleep or awake. Yet seemingly virginity is not lost without
    copulation: for Augustine says (De Virgin. xiii) that "virginal integrity
    and holy continency that refrains from all sexual intercourse is the portion
    of angels." Therefore virginity does not consist in incorruption of the
    flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Virgin. viii) that
    "virginity is continence whereby integrity of the flesh is vowed,
    consecrated and observed in honor of the Creator of both soul and flesh."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Virginity takes its name apparently from
    "viror" [freshness], and just as a thing is described as fresh and retaining
    its freshness, so long as it is not parched by excessive heat, so too,
    virginity denotes that the person possessed thereof is unseared by the heat
    of concupiscence which is experienced in achieving the greatest bodily
    pleasure which is that of sexual intercourse. Hence, Ambrose says (De
    Virgin. i, 5) that "virginal chastity is integrity free of pollution."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now venereal pleasures offer three points for consideration. The first is on
    the part of the body, viz. the violation of the seal of virginity. The
    second is the link between that which concerns the soul and that which
    concerns the body, and this is the resolution of the semen, causing sensible
    pleasure. The third is entirely on the part of the soul, namely the purpose
    of attaining this pleasure. Of these three the first is accidental to the
    moral act, which as such must be considered in reference to the soul. The
    second stands in the relation of matter to the moral act, since the sensible
    passions are the matters of moral acts. But the third stands in the position
    of form and complement, because the essence of morality is perfected in that
    which concerns the reason. Since then virginity consists in freedom from the
    aforesaid corruption, it follows that the integrity of the bodily organ is
    accidental to virginity; while freedom from pleasure in resolution of the
    semen is related thereto materially; and the purpose of perpetually
    abstaining from this pleasure is the formal and completive element in
    virginity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This definition of Augustine's expresses
    directly that which is formal in virginity. For "meditation" denotes
    reason's purpose; and the addition "perpetual" does not imply that a virgin
    must always retain this meditation actually, but that she should bear in
    mind the purpose of always persevering therein. The material element is
    expressed indirectly by the words "on incorruption in a corruptible body."
    This is added to show the difficulty of virginity: for if the flesh were
    incorruptible, it would not be difficult to maintain a perpetual meditation
    on incorruption.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is true that purity, as to its
    essence, is in the soul; but as to its matter, it is in the body: and it is
    the same with virginity. Wherefore Augustine says (De Virgin. viii) that
    "although virginity resides in the flesh," and for this reason is a bodily
    quality, "yet it is a spiritual thing, which a holy continency fosters and
    preserves."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above, the integrity of a
    bodily organ is accidental to virginity, in so far as a person, through
    purposely abstaining from venereal pleasure, retains the integrity of a
    bodily organ. Hence if the organ lose its integrity by chance in some other
    way, this is no more prejudicial to virginity than being deprived of a hand
    or foot.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Pleasure resulting from resolution of
    semen may arise in two ways. If this be the result of the mind's purpose, it
    destroys virginity, whether copulation takes place or not. Augustine,
    however, mentions copulation, because such like resolution is the ordinary
    and natural result thereof. In another way this may happen beside the
    purpose of the mind, either during sleep, or through violence and without
    the mind's consent, although the flesh derives pleasure from it, or again
    through weakness of nature, as in the case of those who are subject to a
    flow of semen. In such cases virginity is not forfeit, because such like
    pollution is not the result of impurity which excludes virginity.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether virginity is unlawful?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that virginity is unlawful. For
    whatever is contrary to a precept of the natural law is unlawful. Now just
    as the words of Gn. 2:16, "Of every tree" that is in "paradise, thou shalt
    eat," indicate a precept of the natural law, in reference to the
    preservation of the individual, so also the words of Gn. 1:28, "Increase and
    multiply, and fill the earth," express a precept of the natural law, in
    reference to the preservation of the species. Therefore just as it would be
    a sin to abstain from all food, as this would be to act counter to the good
    of the individual, so too it is a sin to abstain altogether from the act of
    procreation, for this is to act against the good of the species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever declines from the mean of
    virtue is apparently sinful. Now virginity declines from the mean of virtue,
    since it abstains from all venereal pleasures: for the Philosopher says
    (Ethic. ii, 2), that "he who revels in every pleasure, and abstains from not
    even one, is intemperate: but he who refrains from all is loutish and
    insensible." Therefore virginity is something sinful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, punishment is not due save for a vice.
    Now in olden times those were punished who led a celibate life, as Valerius
    Maximus asserts [*Dict. Fact. Mem. ii, 9]. Hence according to Augustine (De
    Vera Relig. iii) Plato "is said to have sacrificed to nature, in order that
    he might atone for his perpetual continency as though it were a sin."
    Therefore virginity is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> No sin is a matter of direct counsel. But
    virginity is a matter of direct counsel: for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7%3A25"
      >1 Cor. 7:25</a
    >): "Concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give
    counsel." Therefore virginity is not an unlawful thing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In human acts, those are sinful which are
    against right reason. Now right reason requires that things directed to an
    end should be used in a measure proportionate to that end. Again, man's good
    is threefold as stated in Ethic. i, 8; one consisting in external things,
    for instance riches; another, consisting in bodily goods; the third,
    consisting in the goods of the soul among which the goods of the
    contemplative life take precedence of the goods of the active life, as the
    Philosopher shows (Ethic. x, 7), and as our Lord declared (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++10%3A42"
      >Lk. 10:42</a
    >), "Mary hath chosen the better part." Of these goods those that are
    external are directed to those which belong to the body, and those which
    belong to the body are directed to those which belong to the soul; and
    furthermore those which belong to the active life are directed to those
    which belong to the life of contemplation. Accordingly, right reason
    dictates that one use external goods in a measure proportionate to the body,
    and in like manner as regards the rest. Wherefore if a man refrain from
    possessing certain things (which otherwise it were good for him to possess),
    for the sake of his body's good, or of the contemplation of truth, this is
    not sinful, but in accord /with right reason. In like manner if a man
    abstain from bodily pleasures, in order more freely to give himself to the
    contemplation of truth, this is in accordance with the rectitude of reason.
    Now holy virginity refrains from all venereal pleasure in order more freely
    to have leisure for Divine contemplation: for the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7%3A34"
      >1 Cor. 7:34</a
    >): "The unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord:
    that she may be holy in both body and in spirit. But she that is married
    thinketh on the things of the world, how she may please her husband."
    Therefore it follows that virginity instead of being sinful is worthy of
    praise.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A precept implies a duty, as stated
    above (<a href="SS122.html#SSQ122OUTP1">Question [122]</a>,
    <a href="SS122.html#SSQ122A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now there are two kinds
    of duty. There is the duty that has to be fulfilled by one person; and a
    duty of this kind cannot be set aside without sin. The other duty has to be
    fulfilled by the multitude, and the fulfilment of this kind of duty is not
    binding on each one of the multitude. For the multitude has many obligations
    which cannot be discharged by the individual; but are fulfilled by one
    person doing this, and another doing that. Accordingly the precept of
    natural law which binds man to eat must needs be fulfilled by each
    individual, otherwise the individual cannot be sustained. On the other hand,
    the precept of procreation regards the whole multitude of men, which needs
    not only to multiply in body, but also to advance spiritually. Wherefore
    sufficient provision is made for the human multitude, if some betake
    themselves to carnal procreation, while others abstaining from this betake
    themselves to the contemplation of Divine things, for the beauty and welfare
    of the whole human race. Thus too in an army, some take sentry duty, others
    are standard-bearers, and others fight with the sword: yet all these things
    are necessary for the multitude, although they cannot be done by one
    person.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The person who, beside the dictate of
    right reason, abstains from all pleasures through aversion, as it were, for
    pleasure as such, is insensible as a country lout. But a virgin does not
    refrain from every pleasure, but only from that which is venereal: and
    abstains therefrom according to right reason, as stated above. Now the mean
    of virtue is fixed with reference, not to quantity but to right reason, as
    stated in Ethic. ii, 6: wherefore it is said of the magnanimous (Ethic. iv,
    3) that "in point of quantity he goes to the extreme, but in point of
    becomingness he follows the mean."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Laws are framed according to what occurs
    more frequently. Now it seldom happened in olden times that anyone refrained
    from all venereal pleasure through love of the contemplation of truth: as
    Plato alone is related to have done. Hence it was not through thinking this
    a sin, that he offered sacrifice, but "because he yielded to the false
    opinion of his fellow countrymen," as Augustine remarks (De Vera Relig.
    iii).<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether virginity is a virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that virginity is not a virtue. For
    "no virtue is in us by nature," as the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 1). Now
    virginity is in us by nature, since all are virgins when born. Therefore
    virginity is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever has one virtue has all virtues,
    as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Yet some have
    other virtues without having virginity: else, since none can go to the
    heavenly kingdom without virtue, no one could go there without virginity,
    which would involve the condemnation of marriage. Therefore virginity is not
    a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every virtue is recovered by penance.
    But virginity is not recovered by penance: wherefore Jerome says [*Ep. xxii
    ad Eustoch.]: "Other things God can do, but He cannot restore the virgin
    after her downfall." Therefore seemingly virginity is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, no virtue is lost without sin. Yet
    virginity is lost without sin, namely by marriage. Therefore virginity is
    not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, virginity is condivided with widowhood
    and conjugal purity. But neither of these is a virtue. Therefore virginity
    is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Virgin. i, 3): "Love of
    virginity moves us to say something about virginity, lest by passing it over
    we should seem to cast a slight on what is a virtue of high degree."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS152.html#SSQ152A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), the formal and completive element in virginity is the purpose of
    abstaining from venereal pleasure, which purpose is rendered praiseworthy by
    its end, in so far, to wit, as this is done in order to have leisure for
    Divine things: while the material element in virginity is integrity of the
    flesh free of all experience of venereal pleasure. Now it is manifest that
    where a good action has a special matter through having a special
    excellence, there is a special kind of virtue: for example, magnificence
    which is about great expenditure is for this reason a special virtue
    distinct from liberality, which is about all uses of money in general. Now
    to keep oneself free from the experience of venereal pleasure has an
    excellence of its own deserving of greater praise than keeping oneself free
    from inordinate venereal pleasure. Wherefore virginity is a special virtue
    being related to chastity as magnificence to liberality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Men have from their birth that which is
    material in virginity, namely integrity of the flesh and freedom from
    venereal experience. But they have not that which is formal in virginity,
    namely the purpose of safeguarding this integrity for God's sake, which
    purpose gives virginity its character of virtue. Hence Augustine says (De
    Virgin. xi): "Nor do we praise virgins for being virgins, but, because their
    virginity is consecrated to God by holy continency."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Virtues are connected together by reason
    of that which is formal in them, namely charity, or by reason of prudence,
    as stated above (<a href="SS129.html#SSQ129OUTP1">Question [129]</a>,
    <a href="SS129.html#SSQ129A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2), but not by reason
    of that which is material in them. For nothing hinders a virtuous man from
    providing the matter of one virtue, and not the matter of another virtue:
    thus a poor man has the matter of temperance, but not that of magnificence.
    It is in this way that one who has the other virtues lacks the matter of
    virginity, namely the aforesaid integrity of the flesh: nevertheless he can
    have that which is formal in virginity, his mind being so prepared that he
    has the purpose of safeguarding this same integrity of the flesh, should it
    be fitting for him to do so: even as a poor man may be so prepared in mind
    as to have the purpose of being magnificent in his expenditure, were he in a
    position to do so: or again as a prosperous man is so prepared in mind as to
    purpose bearing misfortune with equanimity: without which preparedness of
    the mind no man can be virtuous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Virtue can be recovered by penance as
    regards that which is formal in virtue, but not as to that which is material
    therein. For if a magnificent man has squandered all his wealth he does not
    recover his riches by repenting of his sin. In like manner a person who has
    lost virginity by sin, recovers by repenting, not the matter of virginity
    but the purpose of virginity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As regards the matter of virginity there is that which can be miraculously
    restored by God, namely the integrity of the organ, which we hold to be
    accidental to virginity: while there is something else which cannot be
    restored even by miracle, to wit, that one who has experienced venereal lust
    should cease to have had that experience. For God cannot make that which is
    done not to have been done, as stated in the FP, Question [25], Article
    [4].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Virginity as a virtue denotes the
    purpose, confirmed by vow, of observing perpetual integrity. For Augustine
    says (De Virgin. viii) that "by virginity, integrity of the flesh is vowed,
    consecrated and observed in honor of the Creator of both soul and flesh."
    Hence virginity, as a virtue, is never lost without sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Conjugal chastity is deserving of praise
    merely because it abstains from unlawful pleasures: hence no excellence
    attaches to it above that of chastity in general. Widowhood, however, adds
    something to chastity in general; but it does not attain to that which is
    perfect in this matter, namely to entire freedom from venereal pleasure;
    virginity alone achieves this. Wherefore virginity alone is accounted a
    virtue above chastity, even as magnificence is reckoned above liberality.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether virginity is more excellent than marriage?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that virginity is not more
    excellent than marriage. For Augustine says (De Bono Conjug. xxi):
    "Continence was equally meritorious in John who remained unmarried and
    Abraham who begot children." Now a greater virtue has greater merit.
    Therefore virginity is not a greater virtue than conjugal chastity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the praise accorded a virtuous man
    depends on his virtue. If, then, virginity were preferable to conjugal
    continence, it would seem to follow that every virgin is to be praised more
    than any married woman. But this is untrue. Therefore virginity is not
    preferable to marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the common good takes precedence of the
    private good, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. i, 2). Now marriage is
    directed to the common good: for Augustine says (De Bono Conjug. xvi): "What
    food is to a man's wellbeing, such is sexual intercourse to the welfare of
    the human race." On the other hand, virginity is ordered to the individual
    good, namely in order to avoid what the Apostle calls the "tribulation of
    the flesh," to which married people are subject (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7%3A28"
      >1 Cor. 7:28</a
    >). Therefore virginity is not greater than conjugal continence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Virgin. xix): "Both solid
    reason and the authority of Holy Writ show that neither is marriage sinful,
    nor is it to be equaled to the good of virginal continence or even to that
    of widowhood."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to Jerome (Contra Jovin. i) the error
    of Jovinian consisted in holding virginity not to be preferable to marriage.
    This error is refuted above all by the example of Christ Who both chose a
    virgin for His mother, and remained Himself a virgin, and by the teaching of
    the Apostle who (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7"
      >1 Cor. 7</a
    >) counsels virginity as the greater good. It is also refuted by reason,
    both because a Divine good takes precedence of a human good, and because the
    good of the soul is preferable to the good of the body, and again because
    the good of the contemplative life is better than that of the active life.
    Now virginity is directed to the good of the soul in respect of the
    contemplative life, which consists in thinking "on the things of God"
    [Vulg.: 'the Lord'], whereas marriage is directed to the good of the body,
    namely the bodily increase of the human race, and belongs to the active
    life, since the man and woman who embrace the married life have to think "on
    the things of the world," as the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7%3A34"
      >1 Cor. 7:34</a
    >). Without doubt therefore virginity is preferable to conjugal
    continence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Merit is measured not only by the kind
    of action, but still more by the mind of the agent. Now Abraham had a mind
    so disposed, that he was prepared to observe virginity, if it were in
    keeping with the times for him to do so. Wherefore in him conjugal
    continence was equally meritorious with the virginal continence of John, as
    regards the essential reward, but not as regards the accidental reward.
    Hence Augustine says (De Bono Conjug. xxi) that both "the celibacy of John
    and the marriage of Abraham fought Christ's battle in keeping with the
    difference of the times: but John was continent even in deed, whereas
    Abraham was continent only in habit."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Though virginity is better than conjugal
    continence, a married person may be better than a virgin for two reasons.
    First, on the part of chastity itself; if to wit, the married person is more
    prepared in mind to observe virginity, if it should be expedient, than the
    one who is actually a virgin. Hence Augustine (De Bono Conjug. xxii) charges
    the virgin to say: "I am no better than Abraham, although the chastity of
    celibacy is better than the chastity of marriage." Further on he gives the
    reason for this: "For what I do now, he would have done better, if it were
    fitting for him to do it then; and what they did I would even do now if it
    behooved me now to do it." Secondly, because perhaps the person who is not a
    virgin has some more excellent virtue. Wherefore Augustine says (De Virgin.
    xliv): "Whence does a virgin know the things that belong to the Lord,
    however solicitous she be about them, if perchance on account of some mental
    fault she be not yet ripe for martyrdom, whereas this woman to whom she
    delighted in preferring herself is already able to drink the chalice of the
    Lord?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The common good takes precedence of the
    private good, if it be of the same genus: but it may be that the private
    good is better generically. It is thus that the virginity that is
    consecrated to God is preferable to carnal fruitfulness. Hence Augustine
    says (De Virgin. ix): "It must be confessed that the fruitfulness of the
    flesh, even of those women who in these times seek naught else from marriage
    but children in order to make them servants of Christ, cannot compensate for
    lost virginity."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether virginity is the greatest of virtues?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that virginity is the greatest of
    virtues. For Cyprian says (De Virgin. [*De Habitu Virg.]): "We address
    ourselves now to the virgins. Sublime is their glory, but no less exalted is
    their vocation. They are a flower of the Church's sowing, the pride and
    ornament of spiritual grace, the most honored portion of Christ's flock."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a greater reward is due to the greater
    virtue. Now the greatest reward is due to virginity, namely the hundredfold
    fruit, according to a gloss on Mt. 13:23. Therefore virginity is the
    greatest of the virtues.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the more a virtue conforms us to Christ,
    the greater it is. Now virginity above all conforms us to Christ; for it is
    declared in the Apocalypse 14:4 that virgins "follow the Lamb whithersoever
    He goeth," and (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++14%3A3"
      >Apoc. 14:3</a
    >) that they sing "a new canticle," which "no" other "man" could say.
    Therefore virginity is the greatest of the virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Virgin. xlvi): "No one,
    methinks, would dare prefer virginity to martyrdom," and (De Virgin. xlv):
    "The authority of the Church informs the faithful in no uncertain manner, so
    that they know in what place the martyrs and the holy virgins who have
    departed this life are commemorated in the Sacrament of the Altar." By this
    we are given to understand that martyrdom, and also the monastic state, are
    preferable to virginity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing may excel all others in two ways.
    First, in some particular genus: and thus virginity is most excellent,
    namely in the genus of chastity, since it surpasses the chastity both of
    widowhood and of marriage. And because comeliness is ascribed to chastity
    antonomastically, it follows that surpassing beauty is ascribed to chastity.
    Wherefore Ambrose says (De Virgin. i, 7): "Can anyone esteem any beauty
    greater than a virgin's, since she is beloved of her King, approved by her
    Judge, dedicated to her Lord, consecrated to her God?" Secondly, a thing may
    be most excellent simply, and in this way virginity is not the most
    excellent of the virtues. Because the end always excels that which is
    directed to the end; and the more effectively a thing is directed to the
    end, the better it is. Now the end which renders virginity praiseworthy is
    that one may have leisure for Divine things, as stated above (<a
      href="SS152.html#SSQ152A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >). Wherefore the theological virtues as well as the virtue of religion, the
    acts of which consist in being occupied about Divine things, are preferable
    to virginity. Moreover, martyrs work more mightily in order to cleave to
    God---since for this end they hold their own life in contempt; and those who
    dwell in monasteries---since for this end they give up their own will and
    all that they may possess---than virgins who renounce venereal pleasure for
    that same purpose. Therefore virginity is not simply the greatest of
    virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Virgins are "the more honored portion of
    Christ's flock," and "their glory more sublime" in comparison with widows
    and married women.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The hundredfold fruit is ascribed to
    virginity, according to Jerome [*Ep. cxxiii ad Ageruch.], on account of its
    superiority to widowhood, to which the sixtyfold fruit is ascribed, and to
    marriage, to which is ascribed the thirtyfold fruit. But according to
    Augustine (De Questions. Evang. i, 9), "the hundredfold fruit is given to
    martyrs, the sixtyfold to virgins, and the thirtyfold to married persons."
    Wherefore it does not follow that virginity is simply the greatest of
    virtues, but only in comparison with other degrees of chastity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Virgins "follow the Lamb whithersoever
    He goeth," because they imitate Christ, by integrity not only of the mind
    but also of the flesh, as Augustine says (De Virgin. xxvii). Wherefore they
    follow the Lamb in more ways, but this does not imply that they follow more
    closely, because other virtues make us cleave to God more closely by
    imitation of the mind. The "new hymn" which virgins alone sing, is their joy
    at having preserved integrity of the flesh.<br />
