  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether one man is bound to obey another?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that one man is not bound to obey
    another. For nothing should be done contrary to the divine ordinance. Now
    God has so ordered that man is ruled by his own counsel, according to
    Ecclus. 15:14, "God made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of
    his own counsel." Therefore one man is not bound to obey another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if one man were bound to obey another,
    he would have to look upon the will of the person commanding him, as being
    his rule of conduct. Now God's will alone, which is always right, is a rule
    of human conduct. Therefore man is bound to obey none but God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the more gratuitous the service the more
    is it acceptable. Now what a man does out of duty is not gratuitous.
    Therefore if a man were bound in duty to obey others in doing good deeds,
    for this very reason his good deeds would be rendered less acceptable
    through being done out of obedience. Therefore one man is not bound to obey
    another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is prescribed (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++13%3A17"
      >Heb. 13:17</a
    >): "Obey your prelates and be subject to them."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Just as the actions of natural things proceed
    from natural powers, so do human actions proceed from the human will. In
    natural things it behooved the higher to move the lower to their actions by
    the excellence of the natural power bestowed on them by God: and so in human
    affairs also the higher must move the lower by their will in virtue of a
    divinely established authority. Now to move by reason and will is to
    command. Wherefore just as in virtue of the divinely established natural
    order the lower natural things need to be subject to the movement of the
    higher, so too in human affairs, in virtue of the order of natural and
    divine law, inferiors are bound to obey their superiors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God left man in the hand of his own
    counsel, not as though it were lawful to him to do whatever he will, but
    because, unlike irrational creatures, he is not compelled by natural
    necessity to do what he ought to do, but is left the free choice proceeding
    from his own counsel. And just as he has to proceed on his own counsel in
    doing other things, so too has he in the point of obeying his superiors. For
    Gregory says (Moral. xxxv), "When we humbly give way to another's voice, we
    overcome ourselves in our own hearts."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The will of God is the first rule
    whereby all rational wills are regulated: and to this rule one will
    approaches more than another, according to a divinely appointed order. Hence
    the will of the one man who issues a command may be as a second rule to the
    will of this other man who obeys him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A thing may be deemed gratuitous in two
    ways. In one way on the part of the deed itself, because, to wit, one is not
    bound to do it; in another way, on the part of the doer, because he does it
    of his own free will. Now a deed is rendered virtuous, praiseworthy and
    meritorious, chiefly according as it proceeds from the will. Wherefore
    although obedience be a duty, if one obey with a prompt will, one's merit is
    not for that reason diminished, especially before God, Who sees not only the
    outward deed, but also the inward will.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether obedience is a special virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that obedience is not a special virtue.
    For disobedience is contrary to obedience. But disobedience is a general
    sin, because Ambrose says (De Parad. viii) that "sin is to disobey the
    divine law." Therefore obedience is not a special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every special virtue is either
    theological or moral. But obedience is not a theological virtue, since it is
    not comprised under faith, hope or charity. Nor is it a moral virtue, since
    it does not hold the mean between excess and deficiency, for the more
    obedient one is the more is one praised. Therefore obedience is not a
    special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. xxxv) that
    "obedience is the more meritorious and praiseworthy, the less it holds its
    own." But every special virtue is the more to be praised the more it holds
    its own, since virtue requires a man to exercise his will and choice, as
    stated in Ethic. ii, 4. Therefore obedience is not a special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, virtues differ in species according to
    their objects. Now the object of obedience would seem to be the command of a
    superior, of which, apparently, there are as many kinds as there are degrees
    of superiority. Therefore obedience is a general virtue, comprising many
    special virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> obedience is reckoned by some to be a part of
    justice, as stated above (<a href="SS080.html#SSQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A special virtue is assigned to all good deeds
    that have a special reason of praise: for it belongs properly to virtue to
    render a deed good. Now obedience to a superior is due in accordance with
    the divinely established order of things, as shown above (<a
      href="SS104.html#SSQ104A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), and therefore it is a good, since good consists in mode, species and
    order, as Augustine states (De Natura Boni iii) [*Cf. FP,
    <a href="SS005.html#SSQ5OUTP1">Question [5]</a>,
    <a href="SS005.html#SSQ5A5THEP1">Article [5]</a> ]. Again, this act has a
    special aspect of praiseworthiness by reason of its object. For while
    subjects have many obligations towards their superiors, this one, that they
    are bound to obey their commands, stands out as special among the rest.
    Wherefore obedience is a special virtue, and its specific object is a
    command tacit or express, because the superior's will, however it become
    known, is a tacit precept, and a man's obedience seems to be all the more
    prompt, forasmuch as by obeying he forestalls the express command as soon as
    he understands his superior's will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Nothing prevents the one same material
    object from admitting two special aspects to which two special virtues
    correspond: thus a soldier, by defending his king's fortress, fulfils both
    an act of fortitude, by facing the danger of death for a good end, and an
    act of justice, by rendering due service to his lord. Accordingly the aspect
    of precept, which obedience considers, occurs in acts of all virtues, but
    not in all acts of virtue, since not all acts of virtue are a matter of
    precept, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS096.html#FSQ96OUTP1">Question [96]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS096.html#FSQ96A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Moreover, certain
    things are sometimes a matter of precept, and pertain to no other virtue,
    such things for instance as are not evil except because they are forbidden.
    Wherefore, if obedience be taken in its proper sense, as considering
    formally and intentionally the aspect of precept, it will be a special
    virtue, and disobedience a special sin: because in this way it is requisite
    for obedience that one perform an act of justice or of some other virtue
    with the intention of fulfilling a precept; and for disobedience that one
    treat the precept with actual contempt. On the other hand, if obedience be
    taken in a wide sense for the performance of any action that may be a matter
    of precept, and disobedience for the omission of that action through any
    intention whatever, then obedience will be a general virtue, and
    disobedience a general sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Obedience is not a theological virtue,
    for its direct object is not God, but the precept of any superior, whether
    expressed or inferred, namely, a simple word of the superior, indicating his
    will, and which the obedient subject obeys promptly, according to Titus 3:1,
    "Admonish them to be subject to princes, and to obey at a word," etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It is, however, a moral virtue, since it is a part of justice, and it
    observes the mean between excess and deficiency. Excess thereof is measured
    in respect, not of quantity, but of other circumstances, in so far as a man
    obeys either whom he ought not, or in matters wherein he ought not to obey,
    as we have stated above regarding religion (<a href="SS092.html#SSQ92OUTP1"
      >Question [92]</a
    >, <a href="SS092.html#SSQ92A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). We may also reply
    that as in justice, excess is in the person who retains another's property,
    and deficiency in the person who does not receive his due, according to the
    Philosopher (Ethic. v, 4), so too obedience observes the mean between excess
    on the part of him who fails to pay due obedience to his superior, since he
    exceeds in fulfilling his own will, and deficiency on the part of the
    superior, who does not receive obedience. Wherefore in this way obedience
    will be a mean between two forms of wickedness, as was stated above
    concerning justice (<a href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>,
    <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Obedience, like every virtue requires
    the will to be prompt towards its proper object, but not towards that which
    is repugnant to it. Now the proper object of obedience is a precept, and
    this proceeds from another's will. Wherefore obedience make a man's will
    prompt in fulfilling the will of another, the maker, namely, of the precept.
    If that which is prescribed to him is willed by him for its own sake apart
    from its being prescribed, as happens in agreeable matters, he tends towards
    it at once by his own will and seems to comply, not on account of the
    precept, but on account of his own will. But if that which is prescribed is
    nowise willed for its own sake, but, considered in itself, repugnant to his
    own will, as happens in disagreeable matters, then it is quite evident that
    it is not fulfilled except on account of the precept. Hence Gregory says
    (Moral. xxxv) that "obedience perishes or diminishes when it holds its own
    in agreeable matters," because, to wit, one's own will seems to tend
    principally, not to the accomplishment of the precept, but to the fulfilment
    of one's own desire; but that "it increases in disagreeable or difficult
    matters," because there one's own will tends to nothing beside the precept.
    Yet this must be understood as regards outward appearances: for, on the
    other hand, according to the judgment of God, Who searches the heart, it may
    happen that even in agreeable matters obedience, while holding its own, is
    nonetheless praiseworthy, provided the will of him that obeys tend no less
    devotedly [*Cf. Question [82], Article [2]] to the fulfilment of the
    precept.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Reverence regards directly the person
    that excels: wherefore it admits a various species according to the various
    aspects of excellence. Obedience, on the other hand, regards the precept of
    the person that excels, and therefore admits of only one aspect. And since
    obedience is due to a person's precept on account of reverence to him, it
    follows that obedience to a man is of one species, though the causes from
    which it proceeds differ specifically.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether obedience is the greatest of the virtues?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that obedience is the greatest of the
    virtues. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Sam++15%3A22"
      >1 Kgs. 15:22</a
    >): "Obedience is better than sacrifices." Now the offering of sacrifices
    belongs to religion, which is the greatest of all moral virtues, as shown
    above (<a href="SS081.html#SSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>,
    <a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Therefore obedience is
    the greatest of all virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. xxxv) that
    "obedience is the only virtue that ingrafts virtues in the soul and protects
    them when ingrafted." Now the cause is greater than the effect. Therefore
    obedience is greater than all the virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. xxxv) that "evil
    should never be done out of obedience: yet sometimes for the sake of
    obedience we should lay aside the good we are doing." Now one does not lay
    aside a thing except for something better. Therefore obedience, for whose
    sake the good of other virtues is set aside, is better than other
    virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> obedience deserves praise because it proceeds
    from charity: for Gregory says (Moral. xxxv) that "obedience should be
    practiced, not out of servile fear, but from a sense of charity, not through
    fear of punishment, but through love of justice." Therefore charity is a
    greater virtue than obedience.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Just as sin consists in man contemning God and
    adhering to mutable things, so the merit of a virtuous act consists in man
    contemning created goods and adhering to God as his end. Now the end is
    greater than that which is directed to the end. Therefore if a man condemns
    created goods in order that he may adhere to God, his virtue derives greater
    praise from his adhering to God than from his contemning earthly things. And
    so those, namely the theological, virtues whereby he adheres to God in
    Himself, are greater than the moral virtues, whereby he holds in contempt
    some earthly thing in order to adhere to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Among the moral virtues, the greater the thing which a man condemns that he
    may adhere to God, the greater the virtue. Now there are three kinds of
    human goods that man may contemn for God's sake. The lowest of these are
    external goods, the goods of the body take the middle place, and the highest
    are the goods of the soul; and among these the chief, in a way, is the will,
    in so far as, by his will, man makes use of all other goods. Therefore,
    properly speaking, the virtue of obedience, whereby we contemn our own will
    for God's sake, is more praiseworthy than the other moral virtues, which
    contemn other goods for the sake of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence Gregory says (Moral. xxxv) that "obedience is rightly preferred to
    sacrifices, because by sacrifices another's body is slain whereas by
    obedience we slay our own will." Wherefore even any other acts of virtue are
    meritorious before God through being performed out of obedience to God's
    will. For were one to suffer even martyrdom, or to give all one's goods to
    the poor, unless one directed these things to the fulfilment of the divine
    will, which pertains directly to obedience, they could not be meritorious:
    as neither would they be if they were done without charity, which cannot
    exist apart from obedience. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++2%3A4,5"
      >1 Jn. 2:4,5</a
    >): "He who saith that he knoweth God, and keepeth not His commandments, is
    a liar... but he that keepeth His word, in him in very deed the charity of
    God is perfected": and this because friends have the same likes and
    dislikes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Obedience proceeds from reverence, which
    pays worship and honor to a superior, and in this respect it is contained
    under different virtues, although considered in itself, as regarding the
    aspect of precept, it is one special virtue. Accordingly, in so far as it
    proceeds from reverence for a superior, it is contained, in a way, under
    observance; while in so far as it proceeds from reverence for one's parents,
    it is contained under piety; and in so far as it proceeds from reverence for
    God, it comes under religion, and pertains to devotion, which is the
    principal act of religion. Wherefore from this point of view it is more
    praiseworthy to obey God than to offer sacrifice, as well as because, "in a
    sacrifice we slay another's body, whereas by obedience we slay our own
    will," as Gregory says (Moral. xxxv). As to the special case in which Samuel
    spoke, it would have been better for Saul to obey God than to offer in
    sacrifice the fat animals of the Amalekites against the commandment of
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All acts of virtue, in so far as they
    come under a precept, belong to obedience. Wherefore according as acts of
    virtue act causally or dispositively towards their generation and
    preservation, obedience is said to ingraft and protect all virtues. And yet
    it does not follow that obedience takes precedence of all virtues
    absolutely, for two reasons. First, because though an act of virtue come
    under a precept, one may nevertheless perform that act of virtue without
    considering the aspect of precept. Consequently, if there be any virtue,
    whose object is naturally prior to the precept, that virtue is said to be
    naturally prior to obedience. Such a virtue is faith, whereby we come to
    know the sublime nature of divine authority, by reason of which the power to
    command is competent to God. Secondly, because infusion of grace and virtues
    may precede, even in point of time, all virtuous acts: and in this way
    obedience is not prior to all virtues, neither in point of time nor by
    nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There are two kinds of good. There is
    that to which we are bound of necessity, for instance to love God, and so
    forth: and by no means may such a good be set aside on account of obedience.
    But there is another good to which man is not bound of necessity, and this
    good we ought sometimes to set aside for the sake of obedience to which we
    are bound of necessity, since we ought not to do good by falling into sin.
    Yet as Gregory remarks (Moral. xxxv), "he who forbids his subjects any
    single good, must needs allow them many others, lest the souls of those who
    obey perish utterly from starvation, through being deprived of every good."
    Thus the loss of one good may be compensated by obedience and other
    goods.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether God ought to be obeyed in all things?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that God need not be obeyed in all
    things. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++9%3A30,31"
      >Mt. 9:30,31</a
    >) that our Lord after healing the two blind men commanded them, saying:
    "See that no man know this. But they going out spread His fame abroad in all
    that country." Yet they are not blamed for so doing. Therefore it seems that
    we are not bound to obey God in all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one is bound to do anything contrary
    to virtue. Now we find that God commanded certain things contrary to virtue:
    thus He commanded Abraham to slay his innocent son (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++22"
      >Gn. 22</a
    >); and the Jews to steal the property of the Egyptians (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++11"
      >Ex. 11</a
    >), which things are contrary to justice; and Hosea to take to himself a
    woman who was an adulteress (Hosea 3), and this is contrary to chastity.
    Therefore God is not to be obeyed in all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whoever obeys God conforms his will to
    the divine will even as to the thing willed. But we are not bound in all
    things to conform our will to the divine will as to the thing willed, as
    stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS019.html#FSQ19A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>). Therefore man is
    not bound to obey God in all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++24%3A7"
      >Ex. 24:7</a
    >): "All things that the Lord hath spoken we will do, and we will be
    obedient."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS104.html#SSQ104A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), he who obeys is moved by the command of the person he obeys, just as
    natural things are moved by their motive causes. Now just a God is the first
    mover of all things that are moved naturally, so too is He the first mover
    of all wills, as shown above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Therefore just as
    all natural things are subject to the divine motion by a natural necessity
    so too all wills, by a kind of necessity of justice, are bound to obey the
    divine command.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Our Lord in telling the blind men to
    conceal the miracle had no intention of binding them with the force of a
    divine precept, but, as Gregory says (Moral. xix), "gave an example to His
    servants who follow Him that they might wish to hide their virtue and yet
    that it should be proclaimed against their will, in order that others might
    profit by their example."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even as God does nothing contrary to
    nature (since "the nature of a thing is what God does therein," according to
    a gloss on Rm. 11), and yet does certain things contrary to the wonted
    course of nature; so to God can command nothing contrary to virtue since
    virtue and rectitude of human will consist chiefly in conformity with God's
    will and obedience to His command, although it be contrary to the wonted
    mode of virtue. Accordingly, then, the command given to Abraham to slay his
    innocent son was not contrary to justice, since God is the author of life
    and death. Nor again was it contrary to justice that He commanded the Jews
    to take things belonging to the Egyptians, because all things are His, and
    He gives them to whom He will. Nor was it contrary to chastity that Hosea
    was commanded to take an adulteress, because God Himself is the ordainer of
    human generation, and the right manner of intercourse with woman is that
    which He appoints. Hence it is evident that the persons aforesaid did not
    sin, either by obeying God or by willing to obey Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Though man is not always bound to will
    what God wills, yet he is always bound to will what God wills him to will.
    This comes to man's knowledge chiefly through God's command, wherefore man
    is bound to obey God's commands in all things.<br />

    Whether subjects are bound to obey their superiors in all things?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that subjects are bound to obey their
    superiors in all things. For the Apostle says (Col. 3:20): "Children, obey
    your parents in all things," and farther on (Col. 3:22): "Servants, obey in
    all things your masters according to the flesh." Therefore in like manner
    other subjects are bound to obey their superiors in all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, superiors stand between God and their
    subjects, according to Dt. 5:5, "I was the mediator and stood between the
    Lord and you at that time, to show you His words." Now there is no going
    from extreme to extreme, except through that which stands between. Therefore
    the commands of a superior must be esteemed the commands of God, wherefore
    the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++4%3A14"
      >Gal. 4:14</a
    >): "You... received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus" and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Thess++2%3A13"
      >1 Thess. 2:13</a
    >): "When you had received of us the word of the hearing of God, you
    received it, not as the word of men, but, as it is indeed, the word of God."
    Therefore as man is bound to obey God in all things, so is he bound to obey
    his superiors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as religious in making their
    profession take vows of chastity and poverty, so do they also vow obedience.
    Now a religious is bound to observe chastity and poverty in all things.
    Therefore he is also bound to obey in all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+5%3A29"
      >Acts 5:29</a
    >): "We ought to obey God rather than men." Now sometimes the things
    commanded by a superior are against God. Therefore superiors are not to be
    obeyed in all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS104.html#SSQ104ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,4), he who obeys is moved at the bidding of the person who commands him,
    by a certain necessity of justice, even as a natural thing is moved through
    the power of its mover by a natural necessity. That a natural thing be not
    moved by its mover, may happen in two ways. First, on account of a hindrance
    arising from the stronger power of some other mover; thus wood is not burnt
    by fire if a stronger force of water intervene. Secondly, through lack of
    order in the movable with regard to its mover, since, though it is subject
    to the latter's action in one respect, yet it is not subject thereto in
    every respect. Thus, a humor is sometimes subject to the action of heat, as
    regards being heated, but not as regards being dried up or consumed. In like
    manner there are two reasons, for which a subject may not be bound to obey
    his superior in all things. First on account of the command of a higher
    power. For as a gloss says on Rm. 13:2, "They that resist [Vulg.: 'He that
    resisteth'] the power, resist the ordinance of God" (cf. St. Augustine, De
    Verb. Dom. viii). "If a commissioner issue an order, are you to comply, if
    it is contrary to the bidding of the proconsul? Again if the proconsul
    command one thing, and the emperor another, will you hesitate, to disregard
    the former and serve the latter? Therefore if the emperor commands one thing
    and God another, you must disregard the former and obey God." Secondly, a
    subject is not bound to obey his superior if the latter command him to do
    something wherein he is not subject to him. For Seneca says (De Beneficiis
    iii): "It is wrong to suppose that slavery falls upon the whole man: for the
    better part of him is excepted." His body is subjected and assigned to his
    master but his soul is his own. Consequently in matters touching the
    internal movement of the will man is not bound to obey his fellow-man, but
    God alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless man is bound to obey his fellow-man in things that have to be
    done externally by means of the body: and yet, since by nature all men are
    equal, he is not bound to obey another man in matters touching the nature of
    the body, for instance in those relating to the support of his body or the
    begetting of his children. Wherefore servants are not bound to obey their
    masters, nor children their parents, in the question of contracting marriage
    or of remaining in the state of virginity or the like. But in matters
    concerning the disposal of actions and human affairs, a subject is bound to
    obey his superior within the sphere of his authority; for instance a soldier
    must obey his general in matters relating to war, a servant his master in
    matters touching the execution of the duties of his service, a son his
    father in matters relating to the conduct of his life and the care of the
    household; and so forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When the Apostle says "in all things,"
    he refers to matters within the sphere of a father's or master's
    authority.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man is subject to God simply as regards
    all things, both internal and external, wherefore he is bound to obey Him in
    all things. On the other hand, inferiors are not subject to their superiors
    in all things, but only in certain things and in a particular way, in
    respect of which the superior stands between God and his subjects, whereas
    in respect of other matters the subject is immediately under God, by Whom he
    is taught either by the natural or by the written law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Religious profess obedience as to the
    regular mode of life, in respect of which they are subject to their
    superiors: wherefore they are bound to obey in those matters only which may
    belong to the regular mode of life, and this obedience suffices for
    salvation. If they be willing to obey even in other matters, this will
    belong to the superabundance of perfection; provided, however, such things
    be not contrary to God or to the rule they profess, for obedience in this
    case would be unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly we may distinguish a threefold obedience; one, sufficient for
    salvation, and consisting in obeying when one is bound to obey: secondly,
    perfect obedience, which obeys in all things lawful: thirdly, indiscreet
    obedience, which obeys even in matters unlawful.<br />

    Whether Christians are bound to obey the secular powers?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Christians are not bound to obey
    the secular power. For a gloss on Mt. 17:25, "Then the children are free,"
    says: "If in every kingdom the children of the king who holds sway over that
    kingdom are free, then the children of that King, under Whose sway are all
    kingdoms, should be free in every kingdom." Now Christians, by their faith
    in Christ, are made children of God, according to Jn. 1:12: "He gave them
    power to be made the sons of God, to them that believe in His name."
    Therefore they are not bound to obey the secular power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7%3A4"
      >Rm. 7:4</a
    >): "You... are become dead to the law by the body of Christ," and the law
    mentioned here is the divine law of the Old Testament. Now human law whereby
    men are subject to the secular power is of less account than the divine law
    of the Old Testament. Much more, therefore, since they have become members
    of Christ's body, are men freed from the law of subjection, whereby they
    were under the power of secular princes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, men are not bound to obey robbers, who
    oppress them with violence. Now, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei iv): "Without
    justice, what else is a kingdom but a huge robbery?" Since therefore the
    authority of secular princes is frequently exercised with injustice, or owes
    its origin to some unjust usurpation, it seems that Christians ought not to
    obey secular princes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Titus+3%3A1"
      >Titus 3:1</a
    >): "Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers," and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Pt++2%3A13,14"
      >1 Pt. 2:13,14</a
    >): "Be ye subject... to every human creature for God's sake: whether it be
    to the king as excelling, or to governors as sent by him."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Faith in Christ is the origin and cause of
    justice, according to Rm. 3:22, "The justice of God by faith of Jesus
    Christ:" wherefore faith in Christ does not void the order of justice, but
    strengthens it." Now the order of justice requires that subjects obey their
    superiors, else the stability of human affairs would cease. Hence faith in
    Christ does not excuse the faithful from the obligation of obeying secular
    princes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS104.html#SSQ104A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >), subjection whereby one man is bound to another regards the body; not the
    soul, which retains its liberty. Now, in this state of life we are freed by
    the grace of Christ from defects of the soul, but not from defects of the
    body, as the Apostle declares by saying of himself (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7%3A23"
      >Rm. 7:23</a
    >) that in his mind he served the law of God, but in his flesh the law of
    sin. Wherefore those that are made children of God by grace are free from
    the spiritual bondage of sin, but not from the bodily bondage, whereby they
    are held bound to earthly masters, as a gloss observes on 1 Tim. 6:1,
    "Whosoever are servants under the yoke," etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Old Law was a figure of the New
    Testament, and therefore it had to cease on the advent of truth. And the
    comparison with human law does not stand because thereby one man is subject
    to another. Yet man is bound by divine law to obey his fellow-man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man is bound to obey secular princes in
    so far as this is required by order of justice. Wherefore if the prince's
    authority is not just but usurped, or if he commands what is unjust, his
    subjects are not bound to obey him, except perhaps accidentally, in order to
    avoid scandal or danger.<br />
