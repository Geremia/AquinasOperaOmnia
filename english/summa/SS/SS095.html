  <h3 align="left">Whether divination is a sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that divination is not a sin.
    Divination is derived from something "divine": and things that are divine
    pertain to holiness rather than to sin. Therefore it seems that divination
    is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. i, 1): "Who
    dares to say that learning is an evil?" and again: "I could nowise admit
    that intelligence can be an evil." But some arts are divinatory, as the
    Philosopher states (De Memor. i): and divination itself would seem to
    pertain to a certain intelligence of the truth. Therefore it seems that
    divination is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there is no natural inclination to evil;
    because nature inclines only to its like. But men by natural inclination
    seek to foreknow future events; and this belongs to divination. Therefore
    divination is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++18%3A10,11"
      >Dt. 18:10,11</a
    >): "Neither let there be found among you... any one that consulteth
    pythonic spirits, or fortune tellers": and it is stated in the Decretals
    (26, qu. v, can. Qui divinationes): "Those who seek for divinations shall be
    liable to a penance of five years' duration, according to the fixed grades
    of penance."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Divination denotes a foretelling of the future.
    The future may be foreknown in two ways: first in its causes, secondly in
    itself. Now the causes of the future are threefold: for some produce their
    effects, of necessity and always; and such like future effects can be
    foreknown and foretold with certainty, from considering their causes, even
    as astrologers foretell a coming eclipse. Other causes produce their
    effects, not of necessity and always, but for the most part, yet they rarely
    fail: and from such like causes their future effects can be foreknown, not
    indeed with certainty, but by a kind of conjecture, even as astrologers by
    considering the stars can foreknow and foretell things concerning rains and
    droughts, and physicians, concerning health and death. Again, other causes,
    considered in themselves, are indifferent; and this is chiefly the case in
    the rational powers, which stand in relation to opposites, according to the
    Philosopher [*Metaph. viii, 2,5,8]. Such like effects, as also those which
    ensue from natural causes by chance and in the minority of instances, cannot
    be foreknown from a consideration of their causes, because these causes have
    no determinate inclination to produce these effects. Consequently such like
    effects cannot be foreknown unless they be considered in themselves. Now man
    cannot consider these effects in themselves except when they are present, as
    when he sees Socrates running or walking: the consideration of such things
    in themselves before they occur is proper to God, Who alone in His eternity
    sees the future as though it were present, as stated in the FP, Question
    [14], Article [13]; FP, Question [57], Article [3]; FP, Question [86],
    Article [4]. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++41%3A23"
      >Is. 41:23</a
    >): "Show the things that are to come hereafter, and we shall know that ye
    are gods." Therefore if anyone presume to foreknow or foretell such like
    future things by any means whatever, except by divine revelation, he
    manifestly usurps what belongs to God. It is for this reason that certain
    men are called divines: wherefore Isidore says (Etym. viii, 9): "They are
    called divines, as though they were full of God. For they pretend to be
    filled with the Godhead, and by a deceitful fraud they forecast the future
    to men."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly it is not called divination, if a man foretells things that
    happen of necessity, or in the majority of instances, for the like can be
    foreknown by human reason: nor again if anyone knows other contingent future
    things, through divine revelation: for then he does not divine, i.e. cause
    something divine, but rather receives something divine. Then only is a man
    said to divine, when he usurps to himself, in an undue manner, the
    foretelling of future events: and this is manifestly a sin. Consequently
    divination is always a sin; and for this reason Jerome says in his
    commentary on Mich. 3:9, seqq. that "divination is always taken in an evil
    sense."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Divination takes its name not from a
    rightly ordered share of something divine, but from an undue usurpation
    thereof, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There are certain arts for the
    foreknowledge of future events that occur of necessity or frequently, and
    these do not pertain to divination. But there are no true arts or sciences
    for the knowledge of other future events, but only vain inventions of the
    devil's deceit, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 8).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man has a natural inclination to know
    the future by human means, but not by the undue means of divination.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether divination is a species of superstition?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that divination is not a species of
    superstition. The same thing cannot be a species of diverse genera. Now
    divination is apparently a species of curiosity, according to Augustine (De
    Vera Relig. xxxviii) [*Cf. De Doctr. Christ. ii, 23,24; De Divin. Daem. 3].
    Therefore it is not, seemingly, a species of superstition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as religion is due worship, so is
    superstition undue worship. But divination does not seem to pertain to undue
    worship. Therefore it does not pertain to superstition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, superstition is opposed to religion. But
    in true religion nothing is to be found corresponding as a contrary to
    divination. Therefore divination is not a species of superstition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Origen says in his Peri Archon [*The
    quotation is from his sixteenth homily on the Book of Numbers]: "There is an
    operation of the demons in the administering of foreknowledge, comprised,
    seemingly, under the head of certain arts exercised by those who have
    enslaved themselves to the demons, by means of lots, omens, or the
    observance of shadows. I doubt not that all these things are done by the
    operation of the demons." Now, according to Augustine (De Doctr. Christ. ii,
    20,23), "whatever results from fellowship between demons and men is
    superstitious." Therefore divination is a species of superstition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS095.html#SSQ95A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >; <a href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [92]</a>,94), superstition
    denotes undue divine worship. Now a thing pertains to the worship of God in
    two ways: in one way, it is something offered to God; as a sacrifice, an
    oblation, or something of the kind: in another way, it is something divine
    that is assumed, as stated above with regard to an oath (<a
      href="SS089.html#SSQ89OUTP1"
      >Question [89]</a
    >, <a href="SS089.html#SSQ89A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 2). Wherefore
    superstition includes not only idolatrous sacrifices offered to demons, but
    also recourse to the help of the demons for the purpose of doing or knowing
    something. But all divination results from the demons' operation, either
    because the demons are expressly invoked that the future may be made known,
    or because the demons thrust themselves into futile searchings of the
    future, in order to entangle men's minds with vain conceits. Of this kind of
    vanity it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++39%3A5"
      >Ps. 39:5</a
    >): "Who hath not regard to vanities and lying follies." Now it is vain to
    seek knowledge of the future, when one tries to get it from a source whence
    it cannot be foreknown. Therefore it is manifest that divination is a
    species of superstition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Divination is a kind of curiosity with
    regard to the end in view, which is foreknowledge of the future; but it is a
    kind of superstition as regards the mode of operation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This kind of divination pertains to the
    worship of the demons, inasmuch as one enters into a compact, tacit or
    express with the demons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the New Law man's mind is restrained
    from solicitude about temporal things: wherefore the New Law contains no
    institution for the foreknowledge of future events in temporal matters. On
    the other hand in the Old Law, which contained earthly promises, there were
    consultations about the future in connection with religious matters. Hence
    where it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++8%3A19"
      >Is. 8:19</a
    >): "And when they shall say to you: Seek of pythons and of diviners, who
    mutter in their enchantments," it is added by way of answer: "Should not the
    people seek of their God, a vision for the living and the dead? [*Vulg.:
    'seek of their God, for the living of the dead?']"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the New Testament, however, there were some possessed of the spirit of
    prophecy, who foretold many things about future events.<br />

    Whether we ought to distinguish several species of divination?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we should not distinguish
    several species of divination. Where the formality of sin is the same, there
    are not seemingly several species of sin. Now there is one formality of sin
    in all divinations, since they consist in entering into compact with the
    demons in order to know the future. Therefore there are not several species
    of divination.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a human act takes it species from its
    end, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). But all divination
    is directed to one end, namely, the foretelling of the future. Therefore all
    divinations are of one species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, signs do not vary the species of a sin,
    for whether one detracts by word writing or gestures, it is the same species
    of sin. Now divinations seem to differ merely according to the various signs
    whence the foreknowledge of the future is derived. Therefore there are not
    several species of divination.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore enumerates various species of
    divination (Etym. viii, 9).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS095.html#SSQ95A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), all divinations seek to acquire foreknowledge of future events, by means
    of some counsel and help of a demon, who is either expressly called upon to
    give his help, or else thrusts himself in secretly, in order to foretell
    certain future things unknown to men, but known to him in such manners as
    have been explained in the FP, Question [57], Article [3]. When demons are
    expressly invoked, they are wont to foretell the future in many ways.
    Sometimes they offer themselves to human sight and hearing by mock
    apparitions in order to foretell the future: and this species is called
    "prestigiation" because man's eyes are blindfolded [praestringuntur].
    Sometimes they make use of dreams, and this is called "divination by
    dreams": sometimes they employ apparitions or utterances of the dead, and
    this species is called "necromancy," for as Isidore observes (Etym. viii) in
    Greek, {nekron} "means dead and {manteia} divination, because after certain
    incantations and the sprinkling of blood, the dead seem to come to life, to
    divine and to answer questions." Sometimes they foretell the future through
    living men, as in the case of those who are possessed: this is divination by
    "pythons," of whom Isidore says that "pythons are so called from Pythius
    Apollo, who was said to be the inventor of divination." Sometimes they
    foretell the future by means of shapes or signs which appear in inanimate
    beings. If these signs appear in some earthly body such as wood, iron or
    polished stone, it is called "geomancy," if in water "hydromancy," if in the
    air "aeromancy," if in fire "pyromancy," if in the entrails of animals
    sacrificed on the altars of demons, "aruspicy."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The divination which is practiced without express invocation of the demons
    is of two kinds. The first is when, with a view to obtain knowledge of the
    future, we take observations in the disposition of certain things. If one
    endeavor to know the future by observing the position and movements of the
    stars, this belongs to "astrologers," who are also called "genethliacs,"
    because they take note of the days on which people are born. If one observe
    the movements and cries of birds or of any animals, or the sneezing of men,
    or the sudden movements of limbs, this belongs in general to "augury," which
    is so called from the chattering of birds [avium garritu], just as "auspice"
    is derived from watching birds [avium inspectione]. These are chiefly wont
    to be observed in birds, the former by the ear, the latter by the eye. If,
    however, these observations have for their object men's words uttered
    unintentionally, which someone twist so as to apply to the future that he
    wishes to foreknow, then it is called an "omen": and as Valerius Maximus
    [*De Dict. Fact. Memor. i, 5] remarks, "the observing of omens has a touch
    of religion mingled with it, for it is believed to be founded not on a
    chance movement, but on divine providence. It was thus that when the Romans
    were deliberating whether they would change their position, a centurion
    happened to exclaim at the time: 'Standard-bearer, fix the banner, we had
    best stand here': and on hearing these words they took them as an omen, and
    abandoned their intention of advancing further." If, however, the
    observation regards the dispositions, that occur to the eye, of figures in
    certain bodies, there will be another species of divination: for the
    divination that is taken from observing the lines of the hand is called
    "chiromancy," i.e. divination of the hand (because {cheir} is the Greek for
    hand): while the divination which is taken from signs appearing in the
    shoulder-blades of an animal is called "spatulamancy."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    To this second species of divination, which is without express invocation of
    the demons, belongs that which is practiced by observing certain things done
    seriously by men in the research of the occult, whether by drawing lots,
    which is called "geomancy"; or by observing the shapes resulting from molten
    lead poured into water; or by observing which of several sheets of paper,
    with or without writing upon them, a person may happen to draw; or by
    holding out several unequal sticks and noting who takes the greater or the
    lesser. or by throwing dice, and observing who throws the highest score; or
    by observing what catches the eye when one opens a book, all of which are
    named "sortilege."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly it is clear that there are three kinds of divination. The first
    is when the demons are invoked openly, this comes under the head of
    "necromancy"; the second is merely an observation of the disposition or
    movement of some other being, and this belongs to "augury"; while the third
    consists in doing something in order to discover the occult; and this
    belongs to "sortilege." Under each of these many others are contained, as
    explained above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In all the aforesaid there is the same
    general, but not the same special, character of sin: for it is much more
    grievous to invoke the demons than to do things that deserve the demons'
    interference.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Knowledge of the future or of the occult
    is the ultimate end whence divination takes its general formality. But the
    various species are distinguished by their proper objects or matters,
    according as the knowledge of the occult is sought in various things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The things observed by diviners are
    considered by them, not as signs expressing what they already know, as
    happens in detraction, but as principles of knowledge. Now it is evident
    that diversity of principles diversifies the species, even in demonstrative
    sciences.<br />

    Whether divination practiced by invoking the demons is unlawful?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that divination practiced by
    invoking the demons is not unlawful. Christ did nothing unlawful, according
    to 1 Pt. 2:22, "Who did no sin." Yet our Lord asked the demon: "What is thy
    name?" and the latter replied: "My name is Legion, for we are many" (Mk.
    5:9). Therefore it seems lawful to question the demons about the occult.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the souls of the saints do not encourage
    those who ask unlawfully. Yet Samuel appeared to Saul when the latter
    inquired of the woman that had a divining spirit, concerning the issue of
    the coming war (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Sam++28%3A8,+sqq+"
      >1 Kgs. 28:8, sqq.</a
    >). Therefore the divination that consists in questioning demons is not
    unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it seems lawful to seek the truth from
    one who knows, if it be useful to know it. But it is sometimes useful to
    know what is hidden from us, and can be known through the demons, as in the
    discovery of thefts. Therefore divination by questioning demons is not
    unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++18%3A10,11"
      >Dt. 18:10,11</a
    >): "Neither let there be found among you... anyone that consulteth
    soothsayers... nor... that consulteth pythonic spirits."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> All divination by invoking demons is unlawful
    for two reasons. The first is gathered from the principle of divination,
    which is a compact made expressly with a demon by the very fact of invoking
    him. This is altogether unlawful; wherefore it is written against certain
    persons (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++28%3A15"
      >Is. 28:15</a
    >): "You have said: We have entered into a league with death, and we have
    made a covenant with hell." And still more grievous would it be if sacrifice
    were offered or reverence paid to the demon invoked. The second reason is
    gathered from the result. For the demon who intends man's perdition
    endeavors, by his answers, even though he sometimes tells the truth, to
    accustom men to believe him, and so to lead him on to something prejudicial
    to the salvation of mankind. Hence Athanasius, commenting on the words of
    Lk. 4:35, "He rebuked him, saying: Hold thy peace," says: "Although the
    demon confessed the truth, Christ put a stop to his speech, lest together
    with the truth he should publish his wickedness and accustom us to care
    little for such things, however much he may seem to speak the truth. For it
    is wicked, while we have the divine Scriptures, to seek knowledge from the
    demons."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to Bede's commentary on Lk.
    8:30, "Our Lord inquired, not through ignorance, but in order that the
    disease, which he tolerated, being made public, the power of the Healer
    might shine forth more graciously." Now it is one thing to question a demon
    who comes to us of his own accord (and it is lawful to do so at times for
    the good of others, especially when he can be compelled, by the power of
    God, to tell the truth) and another to invoke a demon in order to gain from
    him knowledge of things hidden from us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to Augustine (Ad Simplic. ii,
    3), "there is nothing absurd in believing that the spirit of the just man,
    being about to smite the king with the divine sentence, was permitted to
    appear to him, not by the sway of magic art or power, but by some occult
    dispensation of which neither the witch nor Saul was aware. Or else the
    spirit of Samuel was not in reality aroused from his rest, but some phantom
    or mock apparition formed by the machinations of the devil, and styled by
    Scripture under the name of Samuel, just as the images of things are wont to
    be called by the names of those things."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> No temporal utility can compare with the
    harm to spiritual health that results from the research of the unknown by
    invoking the demon.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether divination by the stars is unlawful?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that divination by the stars is not
    unlawful. It is lawful to foretell effects by observing their causes: thus a
    physician foretells death from the disposition of the disease. Now the
    heavenly bodies are the cause of what takes place in the world, according to
    Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore divination by the stars is not
    unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, human science originates from
    experiments, according to the Philosopher (Metaph. i, 1). Now it has been
    discovered through many experiments that the observation of the stars is a
    means whereby some future events may be known beforehand. Therefore it would
    seem not unlawful to make use of this kind of divination.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, divination is declared to be unlawful in
    so far as it is based on a compact made with the demons. But divination by
    the stars contains nothing of the kind, but merely an observation of God's
    creatures. Therefore it would seem that this species of divination is not
    unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Confess. iv, 3): "Those
    astrologers whom they call mathematicians, I consulted without scruple;
    because they seemed to use no sacrifice, nor to pray to any spirit for their
    divinations which art, however, Christian and true piety rejects and
    condemns."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS095.html#SSQ95ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,2), the operation of the demon thrusts itself into those divinations which
    are based on false and vain opinions, in order that man's mind may become
    entangled in vanity and falsehood. Now one makes use of a vain and false
    opinion if, by observing the stars, one desires to foreknow the future that
    cannot be forecast by their means. Wherefore we must consider what things
    can be foreknown by observing the stars: and it is evident that those things
    which happen of necessity can be foreknown by this mean,: even so
    astrologers forecast a future eclipse.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    However, with regard to the foreknowledge of future events acquired by
    observing the stars there have been various opinions. For some have stated
    that the stars signify rather than cause the things foretold by means of
    their observation. But this is an unreasonable statement: since every
    corporeal sign is either the effect of that for which it stands (thus smoke
    signifies fire whereby it is caused), or it proceeds from the same cause, so
    that by signifying the cause, in consequence it signifies the effect (thus a
    rainbow is sometimes a sign of fair weather, in so far as its cause is the
    cause of fair weather). Now it cannot be said that the dispositions and
    movements of the heavenly bodies are the effect of future events; nor again
    can they be ascribed to some common higher cause of a corporeal nature,
    although they are referable to a common higher cause, which is divine
    providence. on the contrary the appointment of the movements and positions
    of the heavenly bodies by divine providence is on a different principle from
    the appointment of the occurrence of future contingencies, because the
    former are appointed on a principle of necessity, so that they always occur
    in the same way, whereas the latter are appointed on a principle of
    contingency, so that the manner of their occurrence is variable.
    Consequently it is impossible to acquire foreknowledge of the future from an
    observation of the stars, except in so far as effects can be foreknown from
    their causes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now two kinds of effects escape the causality of heavenly bodies. In the
    first place all effects that occur accidentally, whether in human affairs or
    in the natural order, since, as it is proved in Metaph. vi [*Ed. Did. v, 3],
    an accidental being has no cause, least of all a natural cause, such as is
    the power of a heavenly body, because what occurs accidentally, neither is a
    "being" properly speaking, nor is "one"---for instance, that an earthquake
    occur when a stone falls, or that a treasure be discovered when a man digs a
    grave---for these and like occurrences are not one thing, but are simply
    several things. Whereas the operation of nature has always some one thing
    for its term, just as it proceeds from some one principle, which is the form
    of a natural thing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the second place, acts of the free-will, which is the faculty of will and
    reason, escape the causality of heavenly bodies. For the intellect or reason
    is not a body, nor the act of a bodily organ, and consequently neither is
    the will, since it is in the reason, as the Philosopher shows (De Anima iii,
    4,9). Now no body can make an impression on an incorporeal body. Wherefore
    it is impossible for heavenly bodies to make a direct impression on the
    intellect and will: for this would be to deny the difference between
    intellect and sense, with which position Aristotle reproaches (De Anima iii,
    3) those who held that "such is the will of man, as is the day which the
    father of men and of gods," i.e. the sun or the heavens, "brings on"
    [*Odyssey xviii, 135].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence the heavenly bodies cannot be the direct cause of the free-will's
    operations. Nevertheless they can be a dispositive cause of an inclination
    to those operations, in so far as they make an impression on the human body,
    and consequently on the sensitive powers which are acts of bodily organs
    having an inclination for human acts. Since, however, the sensitive powers
    obey reason, as the Philosopher shows (De Anima iii, 11; Ethic. i, 13), this
    does not impose any necessity on the free-will, and man is able, by his
    reason, to act counter to the inclination of the heavenly bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly if anyone take observation of the stars in order to foreknow
    casual or fortuitous future events, or to know with certitude future human
    actions, his conduct is based on a false and vain opinion; and so the
    operation of the demon introduces itself therein, wherefore it will be a
    superstitious and unlawful divination. On the other hand if one were to
    apply the observation of the stars in order to foreknow those future things
    that are caused by heavenly bodies, for instance, drought or rain and so
    forth, it will be neither an unlawful nor a superstitious divination.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Wherefore the Reply to the First Objection is evident.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That astrologers not unfrequently
    forecast the truth by observing the stars may be explained in two ways.
    First, because a great number of men follow their bodily passions, so that
    their actions are for the most part disposed in accordance with the
    inclination of the heavenly bodies: while there are few, namely, the wise
    alone, who moderate these inclinations by their reason. The result is that
    astrologers in many cases foretell the truth, especially in public
    occurrences which depend on the multitude. Secondly, because of the
    interference of the demons. Hence Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 17):
    "When astrologers tell the truth, it must be allowed that this is due to an
    instinct that, unknown to man, lies hidden in his mind. And since this
    happens through the action of unclean and lying spirits who desire to
    deceive man for they are permitted to know certain things about temporal
    affairs." Wherefore he concludes: "Thus a good Christian should beware of
    astrologers, and of all impious diviners, especially of those who tell the
    truth, lest his soul become the dupe of the demons and by making a compact
    of partnership with them enmesh itself in their fellowship."<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the Third Objection.</p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether divination by dreams is unlawful?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that divination by dreams is not
    unlawful. It is not unlawful to make use of divine instruction. Now men are
    instructed by God in dreams, for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+33%3A15,16"
      >Job 33:15,16</a
    >): "By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, and
    they are sleeping in their beds, then He," God to wit, "openeth the ears of
    men, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn." Therefore it
    is not unlawful to make use of divination by dreams.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those who interpret dreams, properly
    speaking, make use of divination by dreams. Now we read of holy men
    interpreting dreams: thus Joseph interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh's butler
    and of his chief baker (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++40"
      >Gn. 40</a
    >), and Daniel interpreted the dream of the king of Babylon (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++2,4"
      >Dan. 2,4</a
    >). Therefore divination by dreams is not unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is unreasonable to deny the common
    experiences of men. Now it is the experience of all that dreams are
    significative of the future. Therefore it is useless to deny the efficacy of
    dreams for the purpose of divination, and it is lawful to listen to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++18%3A10"
      >Dt. 18:10</a
    >): "Neither let there be found among you any one that... observeth
    dreams."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS095.html#SSQ95ATHEP1"
      >Articles [2]</a
    >,6), divination is superstitious and unlawful when it is based on a false
    opinion. Wherefore we must consider what is true in the matter of
    foreknowing the future from dreams. Now dreams are sometimes the cause of
    future occurrences; for instance, when a person's mind becomes anxious
    through what it has seen in a dream and is thereby led to do something or
    avoid something: while sometimes dreams are signs of future happenings, in
    so far as they are referable to some common cause of both dreams and future
    occurrences, and in this way the future is frequently known from dreams. We
    must, then, consider what is the cause of dreams, and whether it can be the
    cause of future occurrences, or be cognizant of them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly it is to be observed that the cause of dreams is sometimes in us
    and sometimes outside us. The inward cause of dreams is twofold: one regards
    the soul, in so far as those things which have occupied a man's thoughts and
    affections while awake recur to his imagination while asleep. A such like
    cause of dreams is not a cause of future occurrences, so that dreams of this
    kind are related accidentally to future occurrences, and if at any time they
    concur it will be by chance. But sometimes the inward cause of dreams
    regards the body: because the inward disposition of the body leads to the
    formation of a movement in the imagination consistent with that disposition;
    thus a man in whom there is abundance of cold humors dreams that he is in
    the water or snow: and for this reason physicians say that we should take
    note of dreams in order to discover internal dispositions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In like manner the outward cause of dreams is twofold, corporal and
    spiritual. It is corporal in so far as the sleeper's imagination is affected
    either by the surrounding air, or through an impression of a heavenly body,
    so that certain images appear to the sleeper, in keeping with the
    disposition of the heavenly bodies. The spiritual cause is sometimes
    referable to God, Who reveals certain things to men in their dreams by the
    ministry of the angels, according Num. 12:6, "If there be among you a
    prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to
    him in a dream." Sometimes, however, it is due to the action of the demons
    that certain images appear to persons in their sleep, and by this means
    they, at times, reveal certain future things to those who have entered into
    an unlawful compact with them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly we must say that there is no unlawful divination in making use
    of dreams for the foreknowledge of the future, so long as those dreams are
    due to divine revelation, or to some natural cause inward or outward, and so
    far as the efficacy of that cause extends. But it will be an unlawful and
    superstitious divination if it be caused by a revelation of the demons, with
    whom a compact has been made, whether explicit, through their being invoked
    for the purpose, or implicit, through the divination extending beyond its
    possible limits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.</p>

    Whether divination by auguries, omens, and by like observations of external
    things is unlawful?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that divination by auguries, omens,
    and by like observations of external things is not unlawful. If it were
    unlawful holy men would not make use thereof. Now we read of Joseph that he
    paid attention to auguries, for it is related (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++44%3A5"
      >Gn. 44:5</a
    >) that Joseph's steward said: "The cup which you have stolen is that in
    which my lord drinketh and in which he is wont to divine [augurari]": and he
    himself afterwards said to his brethren (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++44%3A15"
      >Gn. 44:15</a
    >): "Know you not that there is no one like me in the science of divining?"
    Therefore it is not unlawful to make use of this kind of divination.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, birds naturally know certain things
    regarding future occurrences of the seasons, according to Jer. 8:7, "The
    kite in the air hath known her time; the turtle, the swallow, and the stork
    have observed the time of their coming." Now natural knowledge is infallible
    and comes from God. Therefore it seems not unlawful to make use of the
    birds' knowledge in order to know the future, and this is divination by
    augury.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gedeon is numbered among the saints (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A32"
      >Heb. 11:32</a
    >). Yet Gedeon made use of an omen, when he listened to the relation and
    interpreting of a dream (Judges 7:15): and Eliezer, Abraham's servant, acted
    in like manner (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++24"
      >Gn. 24</a
    >). Therefore it seems that this kind of divination is not unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++18%3A10"
      >Dt. 18:10</a
    >): "Neither let there be found among you anyone... that observeth
    omens."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The movements or cries of birds, and whatever
    dispositions one may consider in such things, are manifestly not the cause
    of future events: wherefore the future cannot be known therefrom as from its
    cause. It follows therefore that if anything future can be known from them,
    it will be because the causes from which they proceed are also the causes of
    future occurrences or are cognizant of them. Now the cause of dumb animals'
    actions is a certain instinct whereby they are inclined by a natural
    movement, for they are not masters of their actions. This instinct may
    proceed from a twofold cause. In the first place it may be due to a bodily
    cause. For since dumb animals have naught but a sensitive soul, every power
    of which is the act of a bodily organ, their soul is subject to the
    disposition of surrounding bodies, and primarily to that of the heavenly
    bodies. Hence nothing prevents some of their actions from being signs of the
    future, in so far as they are conformed to the dispositions of the heavenly
    bodies and of the surrounding air, to which certain future events are due.
    Yet in this matter we must observe two things: first, that such observations
    must not be applied to the foreknowledge of future things other than those
    which can be foreknown from the movements of heavenly bodies, as stated
    above (<a href="SS095.html#SSQ95ATHEP1">Articles [5]</a>,6): secondly, that
    they be not applied to other matters than those which in some way may have
    reference to these animals (since they acquire through the heavenly bodies a
    certain natural knowledge and instinct about things necessary for their
    life---such as changes resulting from rain and wind and so forth).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the second place, this instinct is produced by a spiritual cause, namely,
    either by God, as may be seen in the dove that descended upon Christ, the
    raven that fed Elias, and the whale that swallowed and vomited Jonas, or by
    demons, who make use of these actions of dumb animals in order to entangle
    our minds with vain opinions. This seems to be true of all such like things;
    except omens, because human words which are taken for an omen are not
    subject to the disposition of the stars, yet are they ordered according to
    divine providence and sometimes according to the action of the demons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly we must say that all such like divinations are superstitious and
    unlawful, if they be extended beyond the limits set according to the order
    of nature or of divine providence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to Augustine [*Questions. in
    Genes., qu. cxlv], when Joseph said that there was no one like him in the
    science of divining, he spoke in joke and not seriously, referring perhaps
    to the common opinion about him: in this sense also spoke his steward.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The passage quoted refers to the
    knowledge that birds have about things concerning them; and in order to know
    these things it is not unlawful to observe their cries and movements: thus
    from the frequent cawing of crows one might say that it will rain soon.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Gedeon listened to the recital and
    interpretation of a dream, seeing therein an omen, ordered by divine
    providence for his instruction. In like manner Eliezer listened to the
    damsel's words, having previously prayed to God.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether divination by drawing lots is unlawful?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that divination by drawing lots is
    not unlawful, because a gloss of Augustine on Ps. 30:16, "My lots are in Thy
    hands," says: "It is not wrong to cast lots, for it is a means of
    ascertaining the divine will when a man is in doubt."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> There is, seemingly, nothing unlawful in the
    observances which the Scriptures relate as being practiced by holy men. Now
    both in the Old and in the New Testament we find holy men practicing the
    casting of lots. For it is related (Jos. 7:14, sqq.) that Josue, at the
    Lord's command, pronounced sentence by lot on Achan who had stolen of the
    anathema. Again Saul, by drawing lots, found that his son Jonathan had eaten
    honey (1 Kgs. 14:58, sqq.): Jonas, when fleeing from the face of the Lord,
    was discovered and thrown into the sea (Jonas 1:7, sqq.): Zacharias was
    chosen by lot to offer incense (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++1%3A9"
      >Lk. 1:9</a
    >): and the apostles by drawing lots elected Matthias to the apostleship (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+1%3A26"
      >Acts 1:26</a
    >). Therefore it would seem that divination by lots is not unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fighting with the fists, or "monomachy,"
    i.e. single combat as it is called, and trial by fire and water, which are
    called "popular" trials, seem to come under the head of sortilege, because
    something unknown is sought by their means. Yet these practices seem to be
    lawful, because David is related to have engaged in single combat with the
    Philistine (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Sam++17%3A32,+sqq+"
      >1 Kgs. 17:32, sqq.</a
    >). Therefore it would seem that divination by lot is not unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written in the Decretals (XXVI, qu. v,
    can. Sortes): "We decree that the casting of lots, by which means you make
    up your mind in all your undertakings, and which the Fathers have condemned,
    is nothing but divination and witchcraft. For which reason we wish them to
    be condemned altogether, and henceforth not to be mentioned among
    Christians, and we forbid the practice thereof under pain of anathema."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS095.html#SSQ95A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), sortilege consists, properly speaking, in doing something, that by
    observing the result one may come to the knowledge of something unknown. If
    by casting lots one seeks to know what is to be given to whom, whether it be
    a possession, an honor, a dignity, a punishment, or some action or other, it
    is called "sortilege of allotment"; if one seeks to know what ought to be
    done, it is called "sortilege of consultation"; if one seeks to know what is
    going to happen, it is called "sortilege of divination." Now the actions of
    man that are required for sortilege and their results are not subject to the
    dispositions of the stars. Wherefore if anyone practicing sortilege is so
    minded as though the human acts requisite for sortilege depended for their
    result on the dispositions of the stars, his opinion is vain and false, and
    consequently is not free from the interference of the demons, so that a
    divination of this kind is superstitious and unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from this cause, however, the result of sortilegious acts must needs
    be ascribed to chance, or to some directing spiritual cause. If we ascribe
    it to chance, and this can only take place in "sortilege of allotment," it
    does not seem to imply any vice other than vanity, as in the case of persons
    who, being unable to agree upon the division of something or other, are
    willing to draw lots for its division, thus leaving to chance what portion
    each is to receive.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, on the other hand, the decision by lot be left to a spiritual cause, it
    is sometimes ascribed to demons. Thus we read (Ezech. 21:21) that "the king
    of Babylon stood in the highway, at the head of two ways, seeking
    divination, shuffling arrows; he inquired of the idols, and consulted
    entrails": sortilege of this kind is unlawful, and forbidden by the
    canons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes, however, the decision is left to God, according to Prov. 16:33,
    "Lots are cast into the lap, but they are disposed of by the Lord":
    sortilege of this kind is not wrong in itself, as Augustine declares
    [*Enarr. ii in Ps. xxx, serm. 2; cf. Objection [1]].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet this may happen to be sinful in four ways. First, if one have recourse
    to lots without any necessity: for this would seem to amount to tempting
    God. Hence Ambrose, commenting on the words of Lk. 1:8, says: "He that is
    chosen by lot is not bound by the judgment of men." Secondly, if even in a
    case of necessity one were to have recourse to lots without reverence.
    Hence, on the Acts of the Apostles, Bede says (Super Act. Apost. i): "But if
    anyone, compelled by necessity, thinks that he ought, after the apostles'
    example, to consult God by casting lots, let him take note that the apostles
    themselves did not do so, except after calling together the assembly of the
    brethren and pouring forth prayer to God." Thirdly, if the Divine oracles be
    misapplied to earthly business. Hence Augustine says (ad inquisit. Januar.
    ii; Ep. lv): "Those who tell fortunes from the Gospel pages, though it is to
    be hoped that they do so rather than have recourse to consulting the demons,
    yet does this custom also displease me, that anyone should wish to apply the
    Divine oracles to worldly matters and to the vain things of this life."
    Fourthly, if anyone resort to the drawing of lots in ecclesiastical
    elections, which should be carried out by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
    Wherefore, as Bede says (Super Act. Apost. i): "Before Pentecost the
    ordination of Matthias was decided by lot," because as yet the fulness of
    the Holy Ghost was not yet poured forth into the Church: "whereas the same
    deacons were ordained not by lot but by the choice of the disciples." It is
    different with earthly honors, which are directed to the disposal of earthly
    things: in elections of this kind men frequently have recourse to lots, even
    as in the distribution of earthly possessions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, there be urgent necessity it is lawful to seek the divine
    judgment by casting lots, provided due reverence be observed. Hence
    Augustine says (Ep. ad Honor. ccxxviii), "If, at a time of persecution, the
    ministers of God do not agree as to which of them is to remain at his post
    lest all should flee, and which of them is to flee, lest all die and the
    Church be forsaken, should there be no other means of coming to an
    agreement, so far as I can see, they must be chosen by lot." Again he says
    (De Doctr. Christ. xxviii): "If thou aboundest in that which it behooves
    thee to give to him who hath not, and which cannot be given to two; should
    two come to you, neither of whom surpasses the other either in need or in
    some claim on thee, thou couldst not act more justly than in choosing by lot
    to whom thou shalt give that which thou canst not give to both."<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the First and Second Objections.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The trial by hot iron or boiling water
    is directed to the investigation of someone's hidden sin, by means of
    something done by a man, and in this it agrees with the drawing of lots. But
    in so far as a miraculous result is expected from God, it surpasses the
    common generality of sortilege. Hence this kind of trial is rendered
    unlawful, both because it is directed to the judgment of the occult, which
    is reserved to the divine judgment, and because such like trials are not
    sanctioned by divine authority. Hence we read in a decree of Pope Stephen V
    [*II, qu. v., can. Consuluist i]: "The sacred canons do not approve of
    extorting a confession from anyone by means of the trial by hot iron or
    boiling water, and no one must presume, by a superstitious innovation, to
    practice what is not sanctioned by the teaching of the holy fathers. For it
    is allowable that public crimes should be judged by our authority, after the
    culprit has made spontaneous confession, or when witnesses have been
    approved, with due regard to the fear of God; but hidden and unknown crimes
    must be left to Him Who alone knows the hearts of the children of men." The
    same would seem to apply to the law concerning duels, save that it
    approaches nearer to the common kind of sortilege, since no miraculous
    effect is expected thereupon, unless the combatants be very unequal in
    strength or skill.<br />
