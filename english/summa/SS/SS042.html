<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider sedition, under which head there are two points of 
inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS042.html#SSQ42A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is a special sin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS042.html#SSQ42A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a mortal sin?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sedition is not a special sin distinct from 
other sins. For, according to Isidore (Etym. x), "a seditious man is one 
who sows dissent among minds, and begets discord." Now, by provoking the 
commission of a sin, a man sins by no other kind of sin than that which 
he provoked. Therefore it seems that sedition is not a special sin 
distinct from discord.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sedition denotes a kind of division. Now schism takes 
its name from scission, as stated above (<A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS039.html#SSQ39OUTP1">Question [39]</a>, <A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS039.html#SSQ39A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore, 
seemingly, the sin of sedition is not distinct from that of schism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every special sin that is distinct from other sins, is 
either a capital vice, or arises from some capital vice. Now sedition is 
reckoned neither among the capital vices, nor among those vices which 
arise from them, as appears from Moral. xxxi, 45, where both kinds of 
vice are enumerated. Therefore sedition is not a special sin, distinct 
from other sins. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Seditions are mentioned as distinct from other sins (2 
Cor. 12:20).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sedition is a special sin, having something in common 
with war and strife, and differing somewhat from them. It has something 
in common with them, in so far as it implies a certain antagonism, and it 
differs from them in two points. First, because war and strife denote 
actual aggression on either side, whereas sedition may be said to denote 
either actual aggression, or the preparation for such aggression. Hence a 
gloss on 2 Cor. 12:20 says that "seditions are tumults tending to fight," 
when, to wit, a number of people make preparations with the intention of 
fighting. Secondly, they differ in that war is, properly speaking, 
carried on against external foes, being as it were between one people and 
another, whereas strife is between one individual and another, or between 
few people on one side and few on the other side, while sedition, in its 
proper sense, is between mutually dissentient parts of one people, as 
when one part of the state rises in tumult against another part. 
Wherefore, since sedition is opposed to a special kind of good, namely 
the unity and peace of a people, it is a special kind of sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A seditious man is one who incites others to sedition, and 
since sedition denotes a kind of discord, it follows that a seditious man 
is one who creates discord, not of any kind, but between the parts of a 
multitude. And the sin of sedition is not only in him who sows discord, 
but also in those who dissent from one another inordinately.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sedition differs from schism in two respects. First, 
because schism is opposed to the spiritual unity of the multitude, viz. 
ecclesiastical unity, whereas sedition is contrary to the temporal or 
secular unity of the multitude, for instance of a city or kingdom. 
Secondly, schism does not imply any preparation for a material fight as 
sedition does, but only for a spiritual dissent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sedition, like schism, is contained under discord, since 
each is a kind of discord, not between individuals, but between the parts 
of a multitude.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether sedition is always a mortal sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sedition is not always a mortal sin. For 
sedition denotes "a tumult tending to fight," according to the gloss 
quoted above (<A Href="SS042.html#SSQ42A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But fighting is not always a mortal sin, indeed it 
is sometimes just and lawful, as stated above (<A Href="SS040.html#SSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="SS040.html#SSQ40A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Much more, 
therefore, can sedition be without a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sedition is a kind of discord, as stated above (<A Href="SS042.html#SSQ42A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3). Now discord can be without mortal sin, and sometimes without any sin 
at all. Therefore sedition can be also. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is praiseworthy to deliver a multitude from a 
tyrannical rule. Yet this cannot easily be done without some dissension 
in the multitude, if one part of the multitude seeks to retain the 
tyrant, while the rest strive to dethrone him. Therefore there can be 
sedition without mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle forbids seditions together with other 
things that are mortal sins (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Cor++12:20">2 Cor. 12:20</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS042.html#SSQ42A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), sedition is contrary to the 
unity of the multitude, viz. the people of a city or kingdom. Now 
Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ii, 21) that "wise men understand the word 
people to designate not any crowd of persons, but the assembly of those 
who are united together in fellowship recognized by law and for the 
common good." Wherefore it is evident that the unity to which sedition is 
opposed is the unity of law and common good: whence it follows manifestly 
that sedition is opposed to justice and the common good. Therefore by 
reason of its genus it is a mortal sin, and its gravity will be all the 
greater according as the common good which it assails surpasses the 
private good which is assailed by strife.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly the sin of sedition is first and chiefly in its authors, who 
sin most grievously; and secondly it is in those who are led by them to 
disturb the common good. Those, however, who defend the common good, and 
withstand the seditious party, are not themselves seditious, even as 
neither is a man to be called quarrelsome because he defends himself, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS041.html#SSQ41OUTP1">Question [41]</a>, <A Href="SS041.html#SSQ41A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is lawful to fight, provided it be for the common good, 
as stated above (<A Href="SS040.html#SSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="SS040.html#SSQ40A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But sedition runs counter to the common 
good of the multitude, so that it is always a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Discord from what is not evidently good, may be without 
sin, but discord from what is evidently good, cannot be without sin: and 
sedition is discord of this kind, for it is contrary to the unity of the 
multitude, which is a manifest good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[42] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A tyrannical government is not just, because it is 
directed, not to the common good, but to the private good of the ruler, 
as the Philosopher states (Polit. iii, 5; Ethic. viii, 10). Consequently 
there is no sedition in disturbing a government of this kind, unless 
indeed the tyrant's rule be disturbed so inordinately, that his subjects 
suffer greater harm from the consequent disturbance than from the 
tyrant's government. Indeed it is the tyrant rather that is guilty of 
sedition, since he encourages discord and sedition among his subjects, 
that he may lord over them more securely; for this is tyranny, being 
conducive to the private good of the ruler, and to the injury of the 
multitude.<br>
