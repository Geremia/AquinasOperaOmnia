  <h3 align="left">Whether disobedience is a mortal sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that disobedience is not a mortal sin.
    For every sin is a disobedience, as appears from Ambrose's definition given
    above (<a href="SS104.html#SSQ104OUTP1">Question [104]</a>,
    <a href="SS104.html#SSQ104A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, Objection [1]).
    Therefore if disobedience were a mortal sin, every sin would be mortal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. xxxi) that
    disobedience is born of vainglory. But vainglory is not a mortal sin.
    Neither therefore is disobedience.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a person is said to be disobedient when
    he does not fulfil a superior's command. But superiors often issue so many
    commands that it is seldom, if ever, possible to fulfil them. Therefore if
    disobedience were a mortal sin, it would follow that man cannot avoid mortal
    sin, which is absurd. Wherefore disobedience is not a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The sin of disobedience to parents is
    reckoned (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++1%3A30;+2+Tim++3:2"
      >Rm. 1:30; 2 Tim. 3:2</a
    >) among other mortal sins.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS024.html#SSQ24OUTP1"
      >Question [24]</a
    >, <a href="SS024.html#SSQ24A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>, Question [88], Article [1]), a mortal sin is
    one that is contrary to charity which is the cause of spiritual life. Now by
    charity we love God and our neighbor. The charity of God requires that we
    obey His commandments, as stated above (<a href="SS024.html#SSQ24OUTP1"
      >Question [24]</a
    >, <a href="SS024.html#SSQ24A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>). Therefore to be
    disobedient to the commandments of God is a mortal sin, because it is
    contrary to the love of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, the commandments of God contain the precept of obedience to
    superiors. Wherefore also disobedience to the commands of a superior is a
    mortal sin, as being contrary to the love of God, according to Rm. 13:2, "He
    that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God." It is also
    contrary to the love of our neighbor, as it withdraws from the superior who
    is our neighbor the obedience that is his due.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The definition given by Ambrose refers
    to mortal sin, which has the character of perfect sin. Venial sin is not
    disobedience, because it is not contrary to a precept, but beside it. Nor
    again is every mortal sin disobedience, properly and essentially, but only
    when one condemns a precept, since moral acts take their species from the
    end. And when a thing is done contrary to a precept, not in contempt of the
    precept, but with some other purpose, it is not a sin of disobedience except
    materially, and belongs formally to another species of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Vainglory desires display of excellence.
    And since it seems to point to a certain excellence that one be not subject
    to another's command, it follows that disobedience arises from vainglory.
    But there is nothing to hinder mortal sin from arising out of venial sin,
    since venial sin is a disposition to mortal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> No one is bound to do the impossible:
    wherefore if a superior makes a heap of precepts and lays them upon his
    subjects, so that they are unable to fulfil them, they are excused from sin.
    Wherefore superiors should refrain from making a multitude of precepts.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether disobedience is the most grievous of sins?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that disobedience is the most grievous
    of sins. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Sam++15%3A23"
      >1 Kgs. 15:23</a
    >): "It is like the sin of witchcraft to rebel, and like the crime of
    idolatry to refuse to obey." But idolatry is the most grievous of sins, as
    stated above (<a href="SS094.html#SSQ94OUTP1">Question [94]</a>,
    <a href="SS094.html#SSQ94A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore disobedience
    is the most grievous of sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sin against the Holy Ghost is one
    that removes the obstacles of sin, as stated above (<a
      href="SS014.html#SSQ14OUTP1"
      >Question [14]</a
    >, <a href="SS014.html#SSQ14A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now disobedience
    makes a man contemn a precept which, more than anything, prevents a man from
    sinning. Therefore disobedience is a sin against the Holy Ghost, and
    consequently is the most grievous of sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A19"
      >Rm. 5:19</a
    >) that "by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners." Now the
    cause is seemingly greater than its effect. Therefore disobedience seems to
    be a more grievous sin than the others that are caused thereby.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Contempt of the commander is a more grievous
    sin than contempt of his command. Now some sins are against the very person
    of the commander, such as blasphemy and murder. Therefore disobedience is
    not the most grievous of sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Not every disobedience is equally a sin: for
    one disobedience may be greater than another, in two ways. First, on the
    part of the superior commanding, since, although a man should take every
    care to obey each superior, yet it is a greater duty to obey a higher than a
    lower authority, in sign of which the command of a lower authority is set
    aside if it be contrary to the command of a higher authority. Consequently
    the higher the person who commands, the more grievous is it to disobey him:
    so that it is more grievous to disobey God than man. Secondly, on the part
    of the things commanded. For the person commanding does not equally desire
    the fulfilment of all his commands: since every such person desires above
    all the end, and that which is nearest to the end. Wherefore disobedience is
    the more grievous, according as the unfulfilled commandment is more in the
    intention of the person commanding. As to the commandments of God, it is
    evident that the greater the good commanded, the more grievous the
    disobedience of that commandment, because since God's will is essentially
    directed to the good, the greater the good the more does God wish it to be
    fulfilled. Consequently he that disobeys the commandment of the love of God
    sins more grievously than one who disobeys the commandment of the love of
    our neighbor. On the other hand, man's will is not always directed to the
    greater good: hence, when we are bound by a mere precept of man, a sin is
    more grievous, not through setting aside a greater good, but through setting
    aside that which is more in the intention of the person commanding.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly the various degrees of disobedience must correspond with the
    various degrees of precepts: because the disobedience in which there is
    contempt of God's precept, from the very nature of disobedience is more
    grievous than a sin committed against a man, apart from the latter being a
    disobedience to God. And I say this because whoever sins against his
    neighbor acts also against God's commandment. And if the divine precept be
    contemned in a yet graver matter, the sin is still more grievous. The
    disobedience that contains contempt of a man's precept is less grievous than
    the sin which condemns the man who made the precept, because reverence for
    the person commanding should give rise to reverence for his command. In like
    manner a sin that directly involves contempt of God, such as blasphemy, or
    the like, is more grievous (even if we mentally separate the disobedience
    from the sin) than would be a sin involving contempt of God's commandment
    alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This comparison of Samuel is one, not of
    equality but of likeness, because disobedience redounds to the contempt of
    God just as idolatry does, though the latter does so more.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Not every disobedience is sin against
    the Holy Ghost, but only that which obstinacy is added: for it is not the
    contempt of any obstacle to sin that constitutes sin against the Holy Ghost,
    else the contempt of any good would be a sin against the Holy Ghost, since
    any good may hinder a man from committing sin. The sin against the Holy
    Ghost consists in the contempt of those goods which lead directly to
    repentance and the remission of sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The first sin of our first parent, from
    which sin was transmitted to a men, was not disobedience considered as a
    special sin, but pride, from which then man proceeded to disobey. Hence the
    Apostle in these words seems to take disobedience in its relation to every
    sin.<br />
