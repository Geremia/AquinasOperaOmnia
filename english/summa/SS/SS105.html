<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS105.html#SSQ105A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is a mortal sin?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that disobedience is not a mortal sin. For every sin is 
a disobedience, as appears from Ambrose's definition given above (<A Href="SS104.html#SSQ104OUTP1">Question [104]</a>, <A Href="SS104.html#SSQ104A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, Objection [1]). Therefore if disobedience were a mortal sin, every sin 
would be mortal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. xxxi) that disobedience is born of 
vainglory. But vainglory is not a mortal sin. Neither therefore is 
disobedience.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a person is said to be disobedient when he does not 
fulfil a superior's command. But superiors often issue so many commands 
that it is seldom, if ever, possible to fulfil them. Therefore if 
disobedience were a mortal sin, it would follow that man cannot avoid 
mortal sin, which is absurd. Wherefore disobedience is not a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The sin of disobedience to parents is reckoned (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A30;+2+Tim++3:2">Rm. 1:30; 2 Tim. 3:2</a>) among other mortal sins.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>, <A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>,  
Question [88], Article [1]), a mortal sin is one that is contrary to charity which is 
the cause of spiritual life. Now by charity we love God and our neighbor. 
The charity of God requires that we obey His commandments, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>, <A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>). Therefore to be disobedient to the commandments of 
God is a mortal sin, because it is contrary to the love of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the commandments of God contain the precept of obedience to 
superiors. Wherefore also disobedience to the commands of a superior is a 
mortal sin, as being contrary to the love of God, according to Rm. 13:2, 
"He that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God." It is also 
contrary to the love of our neighbor, as it withdraws from the superior 
who is our neighbor the obedience that is his due.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The definition given by Ambrose refers to mortal sin, which 
has the character of perfect sin. Venial sin is not disobedience, because 
it is not contrary to a precept, but beside it. Nor again is every mortal 
sin disobedience, properly and essentially, but only when one contemns a 
precept, since moral acts take their species from the end. And when a 
thing is done contrary to a precept, not in contempt of the precept, but 
with some other purpose, it is not a sin of disobedience except 
materially, and belongs formally to another species of sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Vainglory desires display of excellence. And since it seems 
to point to a certain excellence that one be not subject to another's 
command, it follows that disobedience arises from vainglory. But there is 
nothing to hinder mortal sin from arising out of venial sin, since venial 
sin is a disposition to mortal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> No one is bound to do the impossible: wherefore if a 
superior makes a heap of precepts and lays them upon his subjects, so 
that they are unable to fulfil them, they are excused from sin. Wherefore 
superiors should refrain from making a multitude of precepts.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether disobedience is the most grievous of sins?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that disobedience is the most grievous of sins. For it 
is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Sam++15%3A23">1 Kgs. 15:23</a>): "It is like the sin of witchcraft to rebel, 
and like the crime of idolatry to refuse to obey." But idolatry is the 
most grievous of sins, as stated above (<A Href="SS094.html#SSQ94OUTP1">Question [94]</a>, <A Href="SS094.html#SSQ94A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore 
disobedience is the most grievous of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sin against the Holy Ghost is one that removes the 
obstacles of sin, as stated above (<A Href="SS014.html#SSQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="SS014.html#SSQ14A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now disobedience makes a 
man contemn a precept which, more than anything, prevents a man from 
sinning. Therefore disobedience is a sin against the Holy Ghost, and 
consequently is the most grievous of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5%3A19">Rm. 5:19</a>) that "by the disobedience of 
one man, many were made sinners." Now the cause is seemingly greater than 
its effect. Therefore disobedience seems to be a more grievous sin than 
the others that are caused thereby.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Contempt of the commander is a more grievous sin than 
contempt of his command. Now some sins are against the very person of the 
commander, such as blasphemy and murder. Therefore disobedience is not 
the most grievous of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Not every disobedience is equally a sin: for one 
disobedience may be greater than another, in two ways. First, on the part 
of the superior commanding, since, although a man should take every care 
to obey each superior, yet it is a greater duty to obey a higher than a 
lower authority, in sign of which the command of a lower authority is set 
aside if it be contrary to the command of a higher authority. 
Consequently the higher the person who commands, the more grievous is it 
to disobey him: so that it is more grievous to disobey God than man. 
Secondly, on the part of the things commanded. For the person commanding 
does not equally desire the fulfilment of all his commands: since every 
such person desires above all the end, and that which is nearest to the 
end. Wherefore disobedience is the more grievous, according as the 
unfulfilled commandment is more in the intention of the person 
commanding. As to the commandments of God, it is evident that the greater 
the good commanded, the more grievous the disobedience of that 
commandment, because since God's will is essentially directed to the 
good, the greater the good the more does God wish it to be fulfilled. 
Consequently he that disobeys the commandment of the love of God sins 
more grievously than one who disobeys the commandment of the love of our 
neighbor. On the other hand, man's will is not always directed to the 
greater good: hence, when we are bound by a mere precept of man, a sin is 
more grievous, not through setting aside a greater good, but through 
setting aside that which is more in the intention of the person 
commanding.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly the various degrees of disobedience must correspond with the 
various degrees of precepts: because the disobedience in which there is 
contempt of God's precept, from the very nature of disobedience is more 
grievous than a sin committed against a man, apart from the latter being 
a disobedience to God. And I say this because whoever sins against his 
neighbor acts also against God's commandment. And if the divine precept 
be contemned in a yet graver matter, the sin is still more grievous. The 
disobedience that contains contempt of a man's precept is less grievous 
than the sin which contemns the man who made the precept, because 
reverence for the person commanding should give rise to reverence for his 
command. In like manner a sin that directly involves contempt of God, 
such as blasphemy, or the like, is more grievous (even if we mentally 
separate the disobedience from the sin) than would be a sin involving 
contempt of God's commandment alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This comparison of Samuel is one, not of equality  but of 
likeness, because disobedience redounds to the contempt of God just as 
idolatry does, though the latter does so more.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Not every disobedience is sin against the Holy Ghost, but 
only that which obstinacy is added: for it is not the contempt of any 
obstacle to sin that constitutes sin against the Holy Ghost, else the 
contempt of any good would be a sin against the Holy Ghost, since any 
good may hinder a man from committing sin. The sin against the Holy Ghost 
consists in the contempt of those goods which lead directly to repentance 
and the remission of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[105] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The first sin of our first parent, from which sin was 
transmitted to a men, was not disobedience considered as a special sin, 
but pride, from which then man proceeded to disobey. Hence the Apostle in 
these words seems to take disobedience in its relation to every sin.<br>
