</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the will is not the subject of  charity. For 
charity is a kind of love. Now, according to the Philosopher (Topic. ii, 
3) love is in the concupiscible part. Therefore charity is also in the 
concupiscible and not in the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, charity is the foremost of the virtues, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). But the reason is the subject of virtue. Therefore it 
seems that charity is in the reason and not in the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity extends to all human acts, according to 1 Cor. 
16:14: "Let all your things be done in charity." Now the principle of 
human acts is the free-will. Therefore it seems that charity is chiefly 
in the free-will as its subject and not in the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The object of charity is the good, which is also the 
object of the will. Therefore charity is in the will as its subject.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since, as stated in the FP, Question [80], Article [2], the appetite is 
twofold, namely the sensitive, and the intellective which is called the 
will, the object of each is the good, but in different ways: for the 
object of the sensitive appetite is a good apprehended by sense, whereas 
the object of the intellective appetite or will is good under the 
universal aspect of good, according as it can be apprehended by the 
intellect. Now the object of charity is not a sensible good, but the 
Divine good which is known by the intellect alone. Therefore the subject 
of charity is not the sensitive, but the intellective appetite, i.e. the 
will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The concupiscible is a part of the sensitive, not of the 
intellective appetite, as proved in the FP, Question [81], Article [2]: wherefore the 
love which is in the concupiscible, is the love of sensible good: nor can 
the concupiscible reach to the Divine good which is an intelligible good; 
the will alone can. Consequently the concupiscible cannot be the subject 
of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to the Philosopher (De Anima iii, 9), the will 
also is in the reason: wherefore charity is not excluded from the reason 
through being in the will. Yet charity is regulated, not by the reason, 
as human virtues are, but by God's wisdom, and transcends the rule of 
human reason, according to Eph. 3:19: "The charity of Christ, which 
surpasseth all knowledge." Hence it is not in the reason, either as its 
subject, like prudence is, or as its rule, like justice and temperance 
are, but only by a certain kinship of the will to the reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated in the FP, Question [83], Article [4], the free-will is not a 
distinct power from the will. Yet charity is not in the will considered 
as free-will, the act of which is to choose. For choice is of things 
directed to the end, whereas the will is of the end itself (Ethic. iii, 
2). Hence charity, whose object is the last end, should be described as 
residing in the will rather than in the free-will.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether charity is caused in us by infusion?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity is not caused in us by infusion. For 
that which is common to all creatures, is in man naturally. Now, 
according to Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv), the "Divine good", which is the 
object of charity, "is for all an object of dilection and love." 
Therefore charity is in us naturally, and not by infusion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the more lovable a thing is the easier it is to love it. 
Now God is supremely lovable, since He is supremely good. Therefore it is 
easier to love Him than other things. But we need no infused habit in 
order to love other things. Neither, therefore, do we need one in order 
to love God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Tim++1:5">1 Tim. 1:5</a>): "The end of the 
commandment is charity from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an 
unfeigned faith." Now these three have reference to human acts. Therefore 
charity is caused in us from preceding acts, and not from infusion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++5:5">Rm. 5:5</a>): "The charity of God is 
poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, Who is given to us."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), charity is a friendship of 
man for God, founded upon the fellowship of everlasting happiness. Now 
this fellowship is in respect, not of natural, but of gratuitous gifts, 
for, according to Rm. 6:23, "the grace of God is life everlasting": 
wherefore charity itself surpasses our natural facilities. Now that which 
surpasses the faculty of nature, cannot be natural or acquired by the 
natural powers, since a natural effect does not transcend its cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore charity can be in us neither naturally, nor through 
acquisition by the natural powers, but by the infusion of the Holy Ghost, 
Who is the love of the Father and the Son, and the participation of Whom 
in us is created charity, as stated above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Dionysius is speaking of the love of God, which is founded 
on the fellowship of natural goods, wherefore it is in all naturally. On 
the other hand, charity is founded on a supernatural fellowship, so the 
comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as God is supremely knowable in Himself yet not to us, 
on account of a defect in our knowledge which depends on sensible things, 
so too, God is supremely lovable in Himself, in as much as He is the 
object of happiness. But He is not supremely lovable to us in this way, 
on account of the inclination of our appetite towards visible goods. 
Hence it is evident that for us to love God above all things in this way, 
it is necessary that charity be infused into our hearts. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When it is said that in us charity proceeds from "a pure 
heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith," this must be 
referred to the act of charity which is aroused by these things. Or 
again, this is said because the aforesaid acts dispose man to receive the 
infusion of charity. The same remark applies to the saying of Augustine 
(Tract. ix in prim. canon. Joan.): "Fear leads to charity," and of a 
gloss on Mt. 1:2: "Faith begets hope, and hope charity."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether charity is infused according to the capacity of our natural gifts?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity is infused according to the capacity 
of our natural gifts. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++25:15">Mt. 25:15</a>) that "He gave to 
every one according to his own virtue [Douay: 'proper ability']." Now, in 
man, none but natural virtue precedes charity, since there is no virtue 
without charity, as stated above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Therefore God infuses 
charity into man according to the measure of his natural virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, among things ordained towards one another, the second is 
proportionate to the first: thus we find in natural things that the form 
is proportionate to the matter, and in gratuitous gifts, that glory is 
proportionate to grace. Now, since charity is a perfection of nature, it 
is compared to the capacity of nature as second to first. Therefore it 
seems that charity is infused according to the capacity of nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, men and angels partake of happiness according to the 
same measure, since happiness is alike in both, according to Mt. 22:30 
and Lk. 20:36. Now charity and other gratuitous gifts are bestowed on the 
angels, according to their natural capacity, as the Master teaches (Sent. 
ii, D, 3). Therefore the same apparently applies to man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++3:8">Jn. 3:8</a>): "The Spirit breatheth where He 
will," and (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++12:11">1 Cor. 12:11</a>): "All these things one and the same Spirit 
worketh, dividing to every one according as He will." Therefore charity 
is given, not according to our natural capacity, but according as the 
Spirit wills to distribute His gifts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The quantity of a thing depends on the proper cause of 
that thing, since the more universal cause produces a greater effect. 
Now, since charity surpasses the proportion of human nature, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) it depends, not on any natural virtue, but on the sole grace 
of the Holy Ghost Who infuses charity. Wherefore the quantity of charity 
depends neither on the condition of nature nor on the capacity of natural 
virtue, but only on the will of the Holy Ghost Who "divides" His gifts 
"according as He will." Hence the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eph++4:7">Eph. 4:7</a>): "To every one 
of us is given grace according to the measure of the giving of Christ." 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The virtue in accordance with which God gives His gifts to 
each one, is a disposition or previous preparation or effort of the one 
who receives grace. But the Holy Ghost forestalls even this disposition 
or effort, by moving man's mind either more or less, according as He 
will. Wherefore the Apostle says (Col. 1:12): "Who hath made us worthy to 
be partakers of the lot of the saints in light."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The form does not surpass the proportion of the matter. In 
like manner grace and glory are referred to the same genus, for grace is 
nothing else than a beginning of glory in us. But charity and nature do 
not belong to the same genus, so that the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The angel's is an intellectual nature, and it is consistent 
with his condition that he should be borne wholly whithersoever he is 
borne, as stated in the FP, Question [61], Article [6]. Hence there was a greater effort 
in the higher angels, both for good in those who persevered, and for evil 
in those who fell, and consequently those of the higher angels who 
remained steadfast became better than the others, and those who fell 
became worse. But man's is a rational nature, with which it is consistent 
to be sometimes in potentiality and sometimes in act: so that it is not 
necessarily borne wholly whithersoever it is borne, and where there are 
greater natural gifts there may be less effort, and vice versa. Thus the 
comparison fails.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether charity can increase?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity cannot increase. For nothing increases 
save what has quantity. Now quantity is twofold, namely dimensive and 
virtual. The former does not befit charity which is a spiritual 
perfection, while virtual quantity regards the objects in respect of 
which charity does not increase, since the slightest charity loves all 
that is to be loved out of charity. Therefore charity does not increase.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which consists in something extreme receives no 
increase. But charity consists in something extreme, being the greatest 
of the virtues, and the supreme love of the greatest good. Therefore 
charity cannot increase.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, increase is a kind of movement. Therefore wherever there 
is increase there is movement, and if there be increase of essence there 
is movement of essence. Now there is no movement of essence save either 
by corruption or generation. Therefore charity cannot increase 
essentially, unless it happen to be generated anew or corrupted, which is 
unreasonable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Tract. lxxiv in Joan.) [*Cf. Ep. 
clxxxv.] that "charity merits increase that by increase it may merit 
perfection." 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The charity of a wayfarer can increase. For we are called 
wayfarers by reason of our being on the way to God, Who is the last end 
of our happiness. In this way we advance as we get nigh to God, Who is 
approached, "not by steps of the body but by the affections of the soul" 
[*St. Augustine, Tract. in Joan. xxxii]: and this approach is the result 
of charity, since it unites man's mind to God. Consequently it is 
essential to the charity of a wayfarer that it can increase, for if it 
could not, all further advance along the way would cease. Hence the 
Apostle calls charity the way, when he says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++12:31">1 Cor. 12:31</a>): "I show unto 
you yet a more excellent way."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Charity is not subject to dimensive, but only to virtual 
quantity: and the latter depends not only on the number of objects, 
namely whether they be in greater number or of greater excellence, but 
also on the intensity of the act, namely whether a thing is loved more, 
or less; it is in this way that the virtual quantity of charity increases.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Charity consists in an extreme with regard to its object, 
in so far as its object is the Supreme Good, and from this it follows 
that charity is the most excellent of the virtues. Yet not every charity 
consists in an extreme, as regards the intensity of the act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Some have said that charity does not increase in its 
essence, but only as to its radication in its subject, or according to 
its fervor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But these people did not know what they were talking about. For since 
charity is an accident, its being is to be in something. So that an 
essential increase of charity means nothing else but that it is yet more 
in its subject, which implies a greater radication in its subject. 
Furthermore, charity is essentially a virtue ordained to act, so that an 
essential increase of charity implies ability to produce an act of more 
fervent love. Hence charity increases essentially, not by beginning anew, 
or ceasing to be in its subject, as the objection imagines, but by 
beginning to be more and more in its subject.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity increases by addition. For just as 
increase may be in respect of bodily quantity, so may it be according to 
virtual quantity. Now increase in bodily quantity results from addition; 
for the Philosopher says (De Gener. i, 5) that "increase is addition to 
pre-existing magnitude." Therefore the increase of charity which is 
according to virtual quantity is by addition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, charity is a kind of spiritual light in the soul, 
according to 1 Jn. 2:10: "He that loveth his brother abideth  in the 
light." Now light increases in the air by addition; thus the light in a 
house increases when another candle is lit. Therefore charity also 
increases in the soul by addition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the increase of charity is God's work, even as the 
causing of it, according to 2 Cor. 9:10: "He will increase the growth of 
the fruits of your justice." Now when God first infuses charity, He puts 
something in the soul that was not there before. Therefore also, when He 
increases charity, He puts something there which was not there before. 
Therefore charity increases by addition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Charity is a simple form. Now nothing greater results 
from the addition of one simple thing to another, as proved in Phys. iii, 
text. 59, and Metaph. ii, 4. Therefore charity does not increase by 
addition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[5] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Every addition is of something to something else: so that 
in every addition we must at least presuppose that the things added 
together are distinct before the addition. Consequently if charity be 
added to charity, the added charity must be presupposed as distinct from 
charity to which it is added, not necessarily by a distinction of 
reality, but at least by a distinction of thought. For God is able to 
increase a bodily quantity by adding a magnitude which did not exist 
before, but was created at that very moment; which magnitude, though not 
pre-existent in reality, is nevertheless capable of being distinguished 
from the quantity to which it is added. Wherefore if charity be added to 
charity we must presuppose the distinction, at least logical, of the one 
charity from the other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[5] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now distinction among forms is twofold: specific and numeric. Specific 
distinction of habits follows diversity of objects, while numeric 
distinction follows distinction of subjects. Consequently a habit may 
receive increase through extending to objects to which it did not extend 
before: thus the science of geometry increases in one who acquires 
knowledge of geometrical matters which he ignored hitherto. But this 
cannot be said of charity, for even the slightest charity extends to all 
that we have to love by charity. Hence the addition which causes an 
increase of charity cannot be understood, as though the added charity 
were presupposed to be distinct specifically from that to which it is 
added.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[5] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows therefore that if charity be added to charity, we must 
presuppose a numerical distinction between them, which follows a 
distinction of subjects: thus whiteness receives an increase when one 
white thing is added to another, although such an increase does not make 
a thing whiter. This, however, does not apply to the case in point, since 
the subject of charity is none other than the rational mind, so that such 
like an increase of charity could only take place by one rational mind 
being added to another; which is impossible. Moreover, even if it were 
possible, the result would be a greater lover, but not a more loving one. 
It follows, therefore, that charity can by no means increase by addition 
of charity to  charity, as some have held to be the case.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[5] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly charity increases only by its subject partaking of charity 
more and more subject thereto. For this is the proper mode of increase in 
a form that is intensified, since the being of such a form consists 
wholly in its adhering to its subject. Consequently, since the magnitude 
of a thing follows on its being, to say that a form is greater is the 
same as to say that it is more in its subject, and not that another form 
is added to it: for this would be the case if the form, of itself, had 
any quantity, and not in comparison with its subject. Therefore charity 
increases by being intensified in its subject, and this is for charity to 
increase in its essence; and not by charity being added to charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Bodily quantity has something as quantity, and something 
else, in so far as it is an accidental form. As quantity, it is 
distinguishable in respect of position or number, and in this way we have 
the increase of magnitude by addition, as may be seen in animals. But in 
so far as it is an accidental form, it is distinguishable only in respect 
of its subject, and in this way it has its proper increase, like other 
accidental forms, by way of intensity in its subject, for instance in 
things subject to rarefaction, as is proved in Phys. iv, 9. In like 
manner science, as a habit, has its quantity from its objects, and 
accordingly it increases by addition, when a man knows more things; and 
again, as an accidental form, it has a certain quantity through being in 
its subject, and in this way it increase in a man who knows the same 
scientific truths with greater certainty now than before. In the same way 
charity has a twofold quantity; but with regard to that which it has from 
its object, it does not increase, as stated above: hence it follows that 
it increases solely by being intensified.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The addition of light to light can be understood through 
the light being intensified in the air on account of there being several 
luminaries giving light: but this distinction does not apply to the case 
in point, since there is but one luminary shedding forth the light of 
charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The infusion of charity denotes a change to the state of 
"having" charity from the state of "not having it," so that something 
must needs come which was not there before. On the other hand, the 
increase of charity denotes a change to "more having" from "less having," 
so that there is need, not for anything to be there that was not there 
before, but for something to be more there that previously was less 
there. This is what God does when He increases charity, that is He makes 
it to have a greater hold on the soul, and the likeness of the Holy Ghost 
to be more perfectly participated by the soul.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether charity increases through every act of charity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity increases through every act  of 
charity. For that which can do what is more, can do what is less. But 
every act of charity can merit everlasting life; and this is more than a 
simple addition of charity, since it includes the perfection of charity. 
Much more, therefore, does every act of charity increase charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as the habits of acquired virtue are engendered by 
acts, so too an increase of charity is caused by an act of charity. Now 
each virtuous act conduces to the engendering of virtue. Therefore also 
each virtuous act of charity conduces to the increase of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory [*St. Bernard, Serm. ii in Festo Purif.] says 
that "to stand still in the way to God is to go back." Now no man goes 
back when he is moved by an act of charity. Therefore whoever is moved by 
an act of charity goes forward in the way to God. Therefore charity 
increases through every act of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The effect does not surpass the power of its cause. But 
an act of charity is sometimes done with tepidity or slackness. Therefore 
it does not conduce to a more excellent charity, rather does it dispose 
one to a lower degree.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The spiritual increase of charity is somewhat like the 
increase of a body. Now bodily increase in animals and plants is not a 
continuous movement, so that, to wit, if a thing increase so much in so 
much time, it need to increase proportionally in each part of that time, 
as happens in local movement; but for a certain space of time nature 
works by disposing for the increase, without causing any actual increase, 
and afterwards brings into effect that to which it had disposed, by 
giving the animal or plant an actual increase. In like manner charity 
does not actually increase through every act of charity, but each act of 
charity disposes to an increase of charity, in so far as one act of 
charity makes man more ready to act again according to charity, and this 
readiness increasing, man breaks out into an act of more fervent love, 
and strives to advance in charity, and then his charity increases 
actually.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Every act of charity merits everlasting life, which, 
however, is not to be bestowed then and there, but at its proper time. In 
like manner every act of charity merits an increase of charity; yet this 
increase does not take place at once, but when we strive for that 
increase.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even when an acquired virtue is being engendered, each act 
does not complete the formation of the virtue, but conduces towards that 
effect by disposing to it, while the last act, which is the most perfect, 
and acts in virtue of all those that preceded it, reduces the virtue into 
act, just as when many drops hollow out a stone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man advances in the way to God, not merely by  actual 
increase of charity, but also by being disposed to that increase.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether charity increases indefinitely?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity does not increase indefinitely. For 
every movement is towards some end and term, as stated in Metaph. ii, 
text. 8,9. But the increase of charity is a movement. Therefore it tends 
to an end and term. Therefore charity does not increase indefinitely.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no form surpasses the capacity of its subject. But the 
capacity of the rational creature who is the subject of charity is 
finite. Therefore charity cannot increase indefinitely.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every finite thing can, by continual increase, attain to 
the quantity of another finite thing however much greater, unless the 
amount of its increase be ever less and less. Thus the Philosopher states 
(Phys. iii, 6) that if we divide a line into an indefinite number of 
parts, and take these parts away and add them indefinitely to another 
line, we shall never arrive at any definite quantity resulting from those 
two lines, viz. the one from which we subtracted and the one to which we 
added what was subtracted. But this does not occur in the case in point: 
because there is no need for the second increase of charity to be less 
than the first, since rather is it probable that it would be equal or 
greater. As, therefore, the charity of the blessed is something finite, 
if the charity of the wayfarer can increase indefinitely, it would follow 
that the charity of the way can equal the charity of heaven; which is 
absurd. Therefore the wayfarer's charity cannot increase indefinitely.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Phil++3:12">Phil. 3:12</a>): "Not as though I had 
already attained, or were already perfect; but I follow after, if I may, 
by any means apprehend," on which words a gloss says: "Even if he has 
made great progress, let none of the faithful say: 'Enough.' For 
whosoever says this, leaves the road before coming to his destination." 
Therefore the wayfarer's charity can ever increase more and more.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[7] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A term to the increase of a form may be fixed in three 
ways: first by reason of the form itself having a fixed measure, and when 
this has been reached it is no longer possible to go any further in that 
form, but if any further advance is made, another form is attained. And 
example of this is paleness, the bounds of which may, by continual 
alteration, be passed, either so that whiteness ensues, or so that 
blackness results. Secondly, on the part of the agent, whose power does 
not extend to a further increase of the form in its subject. Thirdly, on 
the part of the subject, which is not capable of ulterior perfection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[7] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in none of these ways, is a limit imposed to the increase of man's 
charity, while he is in the state of the wayfarer. For  charity itself 
considered as such has no limit to its increase, since it is a 
participation of the infinite charity which is the Holy Ghost. In like 
manner the cause of the increase of charity, viz. God, is possessed of 
infinite power. Furthermore, on the part of its subject, no limit to this 
increase can be determined, because whenever charity increases, there is 
a corresponding increased ability to receive a further increase. It is 
therefore evident that it is not possible to fix any limits to the 
increase of charity in this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The increase of charity is directed to an end, which is not 
in this, but in a future life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The capacity of the rational creature is increased by 
charity, because the heart is enlarged thereby, according to 2 Cor. 6:11: 
"Our heart is enlarged"; so that it still remains capable of receiving a 
further increase.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument holds good in those things which have the 
same kind of quantity, but not in those which have different kinds: thus 
however much a line may increase it does not reach the quantity of a 
superficies. Now the quantity of a wayfarer's charity which follows the 
knowledge of faith is not of the same kind as the quantity of the charity 
of the blessed, which follows open vision. Hence the argument does not 
prove.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity cannot be perfect in this life. For 
this would have been the case with the apostles before all others. Yet it 
was not so, since the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Phil++3:12">Phil. 3:12</a>): "Not as though I had 
already attained, or were already perfect." Therefore charity cannot be 
perfect in this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 36) that "whatever 
kindles charity quenches cupidity, but where charity is perfect, cupidity 
is done away altogether." But this cannot be in this world, wherein it is 
impossible to live without sin, according to 1 Jn. 1:8: "If we say that 
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves." Now all sin arises from some 
inordinate cupidity. Therefore charity cannot be perfect in this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is already perfect cannot be perfected any more. 
But in this life charity can always increase, as stated above (<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). 
Therefore charity cannot be perfect in this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (In prim. canon. Joan. Tract. v) 
"Charity is perfected by being strengthened; and when it has been brought 
to perfection, it exclaims, 'I desire to be dissolved and to be with 
Christ.'" Now this is possible in this life, as in the case of Paul. 
Therefore charity can be perfect in this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The perfection of charity may be understood in  two ways: 
first with regard to the object loved, secondly with regard to the person 
who loves. With regard to the object loved, charity is perfect, if the 
object be loved as much as it is lovable. Now God is as lovable as He is 
good, and His goodness is infinite, wherefore He is infinitely lovable. 
But no creature can love Him infinitely since all created power is 
finite. Consequently no creature's charity can be perfect in this way; 
the charity of God alone can, whereby He loves Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[8] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the part of the person who loves, charity is perfect, when he loves 
as much as he can. This happens in three ways. First, so that a man's 
whole heart is always actually borne towards God: this is the perfection 
of the charity of heaven, and is not possible in this life, wherein, by 
reason of the weakness of human life, it is impossible to think always 
actually of God, and to be moved by love towards Him. Secondly, so that 
man makes an earnest endeavor to give his time to God and Divine things, 
while scorning other things except in so far as the needs of the present 
life demand. This is the perfection of charity that is possible to a 
wayfarer; but is not common to all who have charity. Thirdly, so that a 
man gives his whole heart to God habitually, viz. by neither thinking nor 
desiring anything contrary to the love of God; and this perfection is 
common to all who have charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle denies that he has the perfection of heaven, 
wherefore a gloss on the same passage says that "he was a perfect 
wayfarer, but had not yet achieved the perfection to which the way leads."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This is said on account of venial sins, which are contrary, 
not to the habit, but to the act of charity: hence they are incompatible, 
not with the perfection of the way, but with that of heaven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The perfection of the way is not perfection simply, 
wherefore it can always increase.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unfitting to distinguish three degrees of charity,

the beginning of charity and its ultimate perfection. Therefore it is not 
right to put only one.<br>

it can increase, as stated above (<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Now for charity to increase is

assigned to charity.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (In prim. canon. Joan. Tract. v) "As 
soon as charity is born it takes food," which refers to beginners, "after 
taking food, it waxes strong," which refers to those who are progressing, 
"and when it has become strong it is perfected," which refers to the 
perfect. Therefore there are three degrees of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[9] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The spiritual increase of charity may be considered in 
respect of a certain likeness to the growth of the human body. For 
although this latter growth may be divided into many parts, yet it has 
certain fixed divisions according to those particular actions or pursuits 
to which man is brought by this same growth. Thus we speak of a man being 
an infant until he has the use of reason, after which we distinguish 
another state of man wherein he begins to speak and to use his reason, 
while there is again a third state, that of puberty when he begins to 
acquire the power of generation, and so on until he arrives at perfection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[9] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner the divers degrees of charity are distinguished according 
to the different pursuits to which man is brought by the increase of 
charity. For at first it is incumbent on man to occupy himself chiefly 
with avoiding sin and resisting his concupiscences, which move him in 
opposition to charity: this concerns beginners, in whom charity has to be 
fed or fostered lest it be destroyed: in the second place man's chief 
pursuit is to aim at progress in good, and this is the pursuit of the 
proficient, whose chief aim is to strengthen their charity by adding to 
it: while man's third pursuit is to aim chiefly at union with and 
enjoyment of God: this belongs to the perfect who "desire to be dissolved 
and to be with Christ."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[9] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner we observe in local motion that at first there is 
withdrawal from one term, then approach to the other term, and thirdly, 
rest in this term.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[9] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All these distinct degrees which can be discerned in the 
increase of charity, are comprised in the aforesaid three, even as every 
division of continuous things is included in these three---the beginning, 
the middle, and the end, as the Philosopher states (De Coelo i, 1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although those who are beginners in charity may progress, 
yet the chief care that besets them is to resist the sins which disturb 
them by their onslaught. Afterwards, however, when they come to feel this 
onslaught less, they begin to tend to perfection with greater security; 
yet with one hand doing the work, and with the other holding the sword as 
related in 2 Esdr 4:17 about those who built up Jerusalem.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even the perfect make progress in charity: yet this is not 
their chief care, but their aim is principally directed towards union 
with God. And though both the beginner and the proficient seek this, yet 
their solicitude is chiefly about other  things, with the beginner, about 
avoiding sin, with the proficient, about progressing in virtue.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether charity can decrease?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity can decrease. For contraries by their 
nature affect the same subject. Now increase and decrease are contraries. 
Since then charity increases, as stated above (<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), it seems that it 
can also decrease.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine, speaking to God, says (Confess. x) "He loves 
Thee less, who loves aught besides Thee": and (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 36) he 
says that "what kindles charity quenches cupidity." For this it seems to 
follow that, on the contrary, what arouses cupidity quenches charity. But 
cupidity, whereby a man loves something besides God, can increase in man. 
Therefore charity can decrease.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 12) "God makes the 
just man, by justifying him, but in such a way, that if the man turns 
away from God, he no longer retains the effect of the Divine operation." 
From this we may gather that when God preserves charity in man, He works 
in the same way as when He first infuses charity into him. Now at the 
first infusion of charity God infuses less charity into him that prepares 
himself less. Therefore also in preserving charity, He preserves less 
charity in him that prepares himself less. Therefore charity can decrease.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In Scripture, charity is compared to fire, according to 
Cant 8:6: "The lamps thereof," i.e. of charity, "are fire and flames." 
Now fire ever mounts upward so long as it lasts. Therefore as long as 
charity endures, it can ascend, but cannot descend, i.e. decrease.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[10] Body Para. 1/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The quantity which charity has in comparison with its 
proper object, cannot decrease, even as neither can it increase, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 2).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[10] Body Para. 2/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since, however, it increases in that quantity which it has in comparison 
with its subject, here is the place to consider whether it can decrease 
in this way. Now, if it decrease, this must needs be either through an 
act, or by the mere cessation from act. It is true that virtues acquired 
through acts decrease and sometimes cease altogether through cessation 
from act, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS053.html#FSQ53OUTP1">Question [53]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS053.html#FSQ53A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Wherefore the Philosopher 
says, in reference to friendship (Ethic. viii, 5) "that want of 
intercourse," i.e. the neglect to call upon or speak with one's friends, 
"has destroyed many a friendship." Now this is because the safe-keeping 
of a thing depends on its cause, and the cause of human virtue is a human 
act, so that when human acts cease, the virtue acquired thereby decreases 
and at last ceases altogether. Yet this does not occur to charity, 
because it is not the result of human acts, but is caused by God alone, 
as stated above (<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Hence it follows that even when  its act ceases, 
it does not for this reason decrease, or cease altogether, unless the 
cessation involves a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[10] Body Para. 3/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The consequence is that a decrease of charity cannot be caused except 
either by God or by some sinful act. Now no defect is caused in us by 
God, except by way of punishment, in so far as He withdraws His grace in 
punishment of sin. Hence He does not diminish charity except by way of 
punishment: and this punishment is due on account of sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[10] Body Para. 4/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows, therefore, that if charity decrease, the cause of this 
decrease must be sin either effectively or by way of merit. But mortal 
sin does not diminish charity, in either of these ways, but destroys it 
entirely, both effectively, because every mortal sin is contrary to 
charity, as we shall state further on (<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>), and by way of merit, since 
when, by sinning mortally, a man acts against charity, he deserves that 
God should withdraw charity from him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[10] Body Para. 5/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner, neither can venial sin diminish charity either 
effectively or by way of merit. Not effectively, because it does not 
touch charity, since charity is about the last end, whereas venial sin is 
a disorder about things directed to the end: and a man's love for the end 
is none the less through his committing an inordinate act as regards the 
things directed to the end. Thus sick people sometimes, though they love 
health much, are irregular in keeping to their diet: and thus again, in 
speculative sciences, the false opinions that are derived from the 
principles, do not diminish the certitude of the principles. So too, 
venial sin does not merit diminution of charity; for when a man offends 
in a small matter he does not deserve to be mulcted in a great matter. 
For God does not turn away from man, more than man turns away from Him: 
wherefore he that is out of order in respect of things directed to the 
end, does not deserve to be mulcted in charity whereby he is ordered to 
the last end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[10] Body Para. 6/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The consequence is that charity can by no means be diminished, if we 
speak of direct causality, yet whatever disposes to its corruption may be 
said to conduce indirectly to its diminution, and such are venial sins, 
or even the cessation from the practice of works of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Contraries affect the same subject when that subject stands 
in equal relation to both. But charity does not stand in equal relation 
to increase and decrease. For it can have a cause of increase, but not of 
decrease, as stated above. Hence the argument does not prove.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Cupidity is twofold, one whereby man places his end in 
creatures, and this kills charity altogether, since it is its poison, as 
Augustine states (Confess. x). This makes us love God less (i.e. less 
than we ought to love Him by charity), not indeed by diminishing charity 
but by destroying it altogether. It is thus that we must understand the 
saying: "He loves Thee less,  who loves aught beside Thee," for he adds 
these words, "which he loveth not for Thee." This does not apply to 
venial sin, but only to mortal sin: since that which we love in venial 
sin, is loved for God's sake habitually though not actually. There is 
another cupidity, that of venial sin, which is always diminished by 
charity: and yet this cupidity cannot diminish charity, for the reason 
given above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[10] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A movement of the free-will is requisite in the infusion of 
charity, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS113.html#FSQ113OUTP1">Question [113]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS113.html#FSQ113A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Wherefore that which 
diminishes the intensity of the free-will conduces dispositively to a 
diminution in the charity to be infused. On the other hand, no movement 
of the free-will is required for the safe-keeping of charity, else it 
would not remain inn us while we sleep. Hence charity does not decrease 
on account of an obstacle on the part of the intensity of the free-will's 
movement.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether we can lose charity when once we have it?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[11] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we cannot lose charity when once we have it. 
For if we lose it, this can only be through sin. Now he who has charity 
cannot sin, for it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Jn++3:9">1 Jn. 3:9</a>): "Whosoever is born of God, 
committeth not sin; for His seed abideth in him, and he cannot sin, 
because he is born of God." But none save the children of God have 
charity, for it is this which distinguishes "the children of God from the 
children of perdition," as Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 17). Therefore he 
that has charity cannot lose it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[11] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. viii, 7) that "if love be not 
true, it should not be called love." Now, as he says again in a letter to 
Count Julian, "charity which can fail was never true." [*The quotation is 
from De Salutaribus Documentis ad quemdam comitem, vii., among the works 
of Paul of Friuli, more commonly known as Paul the Deacon, a monk of 
Monte Cassino.] Therefore it was no charity at all. Therefore, when once 
we have charity, we cannot lose it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[11] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory says in a homily for Pentecost (In Evang. xxx) 
that "God's love works great things where it is; if it ceases to work it 
is not charity." Now no man loses charity by doing great things. 
Therefore if charity be there, it cannot be lost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[11] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the free-will is not inclined to sin unless by some 
motive for sinning. Now charity excludes all motives for sinning, both 
self-love and cupidity, and all such things. Therefore charity cannot be 
lost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[11] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rev+++2:4">Apoc. 2:4</a>): "I have somewhat against 
thee, because thou hast left thy first charity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[11] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The Holy Ghost dwells in us by charity, as  shown above 
(<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [23]</a>,24). We can, accordingly, consider charity in three ways: 
first on the part of the Holy Ghost, Who moves the soul to love God, and 
in this respect charity is incompatible with sin through the power of the 
Holy Ghost, Who does unfailingly whatever He wills to do. Hence it is 
impossible for these two things to be true at the same time---that the 
Holy Ghost should will to move a certain man to an act of charity, and 
that this man, by sinning, should lose charity. For the gift of 
perseverance is reckoned among the blessings of God whereby "whoever is 
delivered, is most certainly delivered," as Augustine says in his book on 
the Predestination of the saints (De Dono Persev. xiv).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[11] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, charity may be considered as such, and thus it is incapable of 
anything that is against its nature. Wherefore charity cannot sin at all, 
even as neither can heat cool, nor unrighteousness do good, as Augustine 
says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 24).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[11] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, charity can be considered on the part of its subject, which is 
changeable on account of the free-will. Moreover charity may be compared 
with this subject, both from the general point of view of form in 
comparison with matter, and from the specific point of view of habit as 
compared with power. Now it is natural for a form to be in its subject in 
such a way that it can be lost, when it does not entirely fill the 
potentiality of matter: this is evident in the forms of things generated 
and corrupted, because the matter of such things receives one form in 
such a way, that it retains the potentiality to another form, as though 
its potentiality were not completely satisfied with the one form. Hence 
the one form may be lost by the other being received. On the other hand 
the form of a celestial body which entirely fills the potentiality of its 
matter, so that the latter does not retain the potentiality to another 
form, is in its subject inseparably. Accordingly the charity of the 
blessed, because it entirely fills the potentiality of the rational mind, 
since every actual movement of that mind is directed to God, is possessed 
by its subject inseparably: whereas the charity of the wayfarer does not 
so fill the potentiality of its subject, because the latter is not always 
actually directed to God: so that when it is not actually directed to 
God, something may occur whereby charity is lost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[11] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is proper to a habit to incline a power to act, and this belongs to a 
habit, in so far as it makes whatever is suitable to it, to seem good, 
and whatever is unsuitable, to seem evil. For as the taste judges of 
savors according to its disposition, even so does the human mind judge of 
things to be done, according to its habitual disposition. Hence the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 5) that "such as a man is, so does the end 
appear to him." Accordingly charity is inseparable from its possessor, 
where that which pertains to charity cannot appear otherwise than good, 
and that is in heaven, where God is seen in His Essence, which is the 
very essence of goodness. Therefore the charity of heaven cannot be lost, 
whereas the charity of the way can, because in this state God is not seen 
in His Essence, which is the essence of goodness. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[11] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The passage quoted speaks from the point of view of the 
power of the Holy Ghost, by Whose safeguarding, those whom He wills to 
move are rendered immune from sin, as much as He wills.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[11] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The charity which can fail by reason of itself is no true 
charity; for this would be the case, were its love given only for a time, 
and afterwards were to cease, which would be inconsistent with true love. 
If, however, charity be lost through the changeableness of the subject, 
and against the purpose of charity included in its act, this is not 
contrary to true charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[11] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The love of God ever works great things in its purpose, 
which is essential to charity; but it does not always work great things 
in its act, on account of the condition of its subject.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[11] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Charity by reason of its act excludes every motive for 
sinning. But it happens sometimes that charity is not acting actually, 
and then it is possible for a motive to intervene for sinning, and if we 
consent to this motive, we lose charity.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether charity is lost through one mortal sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity is not lost through one mortal sin. 
For Origen says (Peri Archon i): "When a man who has mounted to the stage 
of perfection, is satiated, I do not think that he will become empty or 
fall away suddenly; but he must needs do so gradually and by little and 
little." But man falls away by losing charity. Therefore charity is not 
lost through only one mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Pope Leo in a sermon on the Passion (60) addresses Peter 
thus: "Our Lord saw in thee not a conquered faith, not an averted love, 
but constancy shaken. Tears abounded where love never failed, and the 
words uttered in trepidation were washed away by the fount of charity." 
From this Bernard [*William of St. Thierry, De Nat. et Dig. Amoris. vi.] 
drew his assertion that "charity in Peter was not quenched, but cooled." 
But Peter sinned mortally in denying Christ. Therefore charity is not 
lost through one mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity is stronger than an acquired virtue. Now a habit 
of acquired virtue is not destroyed by one contrary sinful act. Much 
less, therefore, is charity destroyed by one contrary mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, charity denotes love of God and our neighbor. Now, 
seemingly, one may commit a mortal sin, and yet retain the love of God 
and one's neighbor; because an inordinate affection for things directed 
to the end, does not remove the love for the end, as stated above (<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>). Therefore charity towards God can endure, though there be a mortal sin 
through an inordinate affection for  some temporal good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the object of a theological virtue is the last end. Now 
the other theological virtues, namely faith and hope, are not done away 
by one mortal sin, in fact they remain though lifeless. Therefore charity 
can remain without a form, even when a mortal sin has been committed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> By mortal sin man becomes deserving of eternal death, 
according to Rm. 6:23: "The wages of sin is death." On the other hand 
whoever has charity is deserving of eternal life, for it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++14:21">Jn. 14:21</a>): "He that loveth Me, shall be loved by My Father: and I will love 
Him, and will manifest Myself to him," in which manifestation everlasting 
life consists, according to Jn. 17:3: "This is eternal life; that they 
may know Thee the . . . true God, and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent." 
Now no man can be worthy, at the same time, of eternal life and of 
eternal death. Therefore it is impossible for a man to have charity with 
a mortal sin. Therefore charity is destroyed by one mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> That one contrary is removed by the other contrary 
supervening. Now every mortal sin is contrary to charity by its very 
nature, which consists in man's loving God above all things, and 
subjecting himself to Him entirely, by referring all that is his to God. 
It is therefore essential to charity that man should so love God as to 
wish to submit to Him in all things, and always to follow the rule of His 
commandments; since whatever is contrary to His commandments is 
manifestly contrary to charity, and therefore by its very nature is 
capable of destroying charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If indeed charity were an acquired habit dependent on the power of its 
subject, it would not necessarily be removed by one mortal sin, for act 
is directly contrary, not to habit but to act. Now the endurance of a 
habit in its subject does not require the endurance of its act, so that 
when a contrary act supervenes the acquired habit is not at once done 
away. But charity, being an infused habit, depends on the action of God 
Who infuses it, Who stands in relation to the infusion and safekeeping of 
charity, as the sun does to the diffusion of light in the air, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>, OBJ 3). Consequently, just as the light would cease at once 
in the air, were an obstacle placed to its being lit up by the sun, even 
so charity ceases at once to be in the soul through the placing of an 
obstacle to the outpouring of charity by God into the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is evident that through every mortal sin which is contrary to 
God's commandments, an obstacle is placed to the outpouring of charity, 
since from the very fact that a man chooses to prefer sin to God's 
friendship, which requires that we should obey His will, it follows that 
the habit of charity is lost at once through one mortal sin. Hence 
Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 12) that "man is enlightened by God's 
presence, but he is darkened at once by God's absence, because distance 
from Him is effected not by change of place but by aversion of the will."

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This saying of Origen may be understood, in one way, that a 
man who is in the state of perfection, does not suddenly go so far as to 
commit a mortal sin, but is disposed thereto by some previous negligence, 
for which reason venial sins are said to be dispositions to mortal sin, 
as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS088.html#FSQ88OUTP1">Question [88]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS088.html#FSQ88A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Nevertheless he falls, and loses 
charity through the one mortal sin if he commits it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since, however, he adds: "If some slight slip should occur, and he 
recover himself quickly he does not appear to fall altogether," we may 
reply in another way, that when he speaks of a man being emptied and 
falling away altogether, he means one who falls so as to sin through 
malice; and this does not occur in a perfect man all at once.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Charity may be lost in two ways; first, directly, by actual 
contempt, and, in this way, Peter did not lose charity. Secondly, 
indirectly, when a sin is committed against charity, through some passion 
of desire or fear; it was by sinning against charity in this way, that 
Peter lost charity; yet he soon recovered it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reply to the Third Objection is evident from what has been said.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Not every inordinate affection for things directed to the 
end, i.e., for created goods, constitutes a mortal sin, but only such as 
is directly contrary to the Divine will; and then the inordinate 
affection is contrary to charity, as stated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[24] A[12] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Charity denotes union with God, whereas faith and hope do 
not. Now every mortal sin consists in aversion from God, as stated above 
(Gen. ad lit. viii, 12). Consequently every moral sin is contrary to 
charity, but not to faith and hope, but only certain determinate sins, 
which destroy the habit of faith or of hope, even as charity is destroyed 
by every moral sin. Hence it is evident that charity cannot remain 
lifeless, since it is itself the ultimate form regarding God under the 
aspect of last end as stated above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>).<br>
