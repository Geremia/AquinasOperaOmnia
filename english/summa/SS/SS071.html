<H3 Align="Center">OF INJUSTICE IN JUDGMENT ON THE PART OF COUNSEL (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the injustice which takes place in judgment on the 
part of counsel, and under this head there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS071.html#SSQ71A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether an advocate is bound to defend the suits of the poor?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS071.html#SSQ71A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether certain persons should be prohibited from exercising the 
office of advocate?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS071.html#SSQ71A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether an advocate sins by defending an unjust cause?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS071.html#SSQ71A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether he sins if he accept a fee for defending a suit?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an advocate is bound to defend the suits of 
the poor. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++23%3A5">Ex. 23:5</a>): "If thou see the ass of him that 
hateth thee lie underneath his burden, thou shalt not pass by, but shall 
lift him up with him." Now no less a danger threatens the poor man whose 
suit is being unjustly prejudiced, than if his ass were to lie underneath 
its burden. Therefore an advocate is bound to defend the suits of the 
poor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory says in a homily (ix in Evang.): "Let him that 
hath understanding beware lest he withhold his knowledge; let him that 
hath abundance of wealth watch lest he slacken his merciful bounty; let 
him who is a servant to art share his skill with his neighbor; let him 
who has an opportunity of speaking with the wealthy plead the cause of 
the poor: for the slightest gift you have received will be reputed a 
talent." Now every man is bound, not to hide but faithfully to dispense 
the talent committed to him; as evidenced by the punishment inflicted on 
the servant who hid his talent (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++25%3A30">Mt. 25:30</a>). Therefore an advocate is 
bound to plead for the poor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the precept about performing works of mercy, being 
affirmative, is binding according to time and place, and this is chiefly 
in cases of need. Now it seems to be a case of need when  the suit of a 
poor man is being prejudiced. Therefore it seems that in such a case an 
advocate is bound to defend the poor man's suit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> He that lacks food is no less in need than he that 
lacks an advocate. Yet he that is able to give food is not always bound 
to feed the needy. Therefore neither is an advocate always bound to 
defend the suits of the poor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since defense of the poor man's suit belongs to the works 
of mercy, the answer to this inquiry is the same as the one given above 
with regard to the other works of mercy (<A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS032.html#SSQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS032.html#SSQ32ATHEP1">Articles [5]</a>,9). Now no man is 
sufficient to bestow a work of mercy on all those who need it. Wherefore, 
as Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 28), "since one cannot do good to 
all, we ought to consider those chiefly who by reason of place, time, or 
any other circumstance, by a kind of chance are more closely united to 
us." He says "by reason of place," because one is not bound to search 
throughout the world for the needy that one may succor them; and it 
suffices to do works of mercy to those one meets with. Hence it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++23%3A4">Ex. 23:4</a>): "If thou meet thy enemy's ass going astray, bring it 
back to him." He says also "by reason of time," because one is not bound 
to provide for the future needs of others, and it suffices to succor 
present needs. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++3%3A17">1 Jn. 3:17</a>): "He that . . . shall see 
his brother in need, and shall put up his bowels from him, how doth the 
charity of God abide in him?" Lastly he says, "or any other 
circumstance," because one ought to show kindness to those especially who 
are by any tie whatever united to us, according to 1 Tim. 5:8, "If any 
man have not care of his own, and especially of those of his house, he 
hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It may happen however that these circumstances concur, and then we have 
to consider whether this particular man stands in such a need that it is 
not easy to see how he can be succored otherwise, and then one is bound 
to bestow the work of mercy on him. If, however, it is easy to see how he 
can be otherwise succored, either by himself, or by some other person 
still more closely united to him, or in a better position to help him, 
one is not bound so strictly to help the one in need that it would be a 
sin not to do so: although it would be praiseworthy to do so where one is 
not bound to. Therefore an advocate is not always bound to defend the 
suits of the poor, but only when the aforesaid circumstances concur, else 
he would have to put aside all other business, and occupy himself 
entirely in defending the suits of poor people. The same applies to a 
physician with regard to attendance on the sick.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> So long as the ass lies under the burden, there is no means 
of help in this case, unless those who are passing along come to the 
man's aid, and therefore they are bound to help. But they would not be so 
bound if help were possible from another quarter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A man is bound to make good use of the talent bestowed on 
him, according to the opportunities afforded by time,  place, and other 
circumstances, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Not every need is such that it is one's duty to remedy it, 
but only such as we have stated above.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is fitting that the law should debar certain persons from the office of advocate?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unfitting for the law to debar certain persons from 
the office of advocate. For no man should be debarred from doing works of 
mercy. Now it belongs to the works of mercy to defend a man's suit, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS071.html#SSQ71A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore no man should be debarred from this office.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, contrary causes have not, seemingly, the same effect. 
Now to be busy with Divine things and to be busy about sin are contrary 
to one another. Therefore it is unfitting that some should be debarred 
from the office of advocate, on account of religion, as monks and 
clerics, while others are debarred on account of sin, as persons of 
ill-repute and heretics.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a man should love his neighbor as himself. Now it is a 
duty of love for an advocate to plead a person's cause. Therefore it is 
unfitting that certain persons should be debarred from pleading the cause 
of others, while they are allowed to advocate their own cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> According to Decretals III, qu. vii, can. Infames, many 
persons are debarred from the office of advocate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In two ways a person is debarred from performing a 
certain act: first because it is impossible to him, secondly because it 
is unbecoming to him: but, whereas the man to whom a certain act is 
impossible, is absolutely debarred from performing it, he to whom an act 
is unbecoming is not debarred altogether, since necessity may do away 
with its unbecomingness. Accordingly some are debarred from the office of 
advocate because it is impossible to them through lack of sense---either 
interior, as in the case of madmen and minors---or exterior, as in the 
case of the deaf and dumb. For an advocate needs to have both interior 
skill so that he may be able to prove the justice of the cause he 
defends, and also speech and hearing, that he may speak and hear what is 
said to him. Consequently those who are defective in these points, are 
altogether debarred from being advocates either in their own or in 
another's cause. The becomingness of exercising this office is removed in 
two ways. First, through a man being engaged in higher things. Wherefore 
it is unfitting that monks or priests should be advocates in any cause 
whatever, or that clerics should plead in a secular court, because such 
persons are engaged in Divine things. Secondly, on account of some 
personal defect, either of body (for instance a blind man whose 
attendance in a court of justice would be unbecoming) or of soul, for it 
ill becomes one who has disdained to be just himself, to plead for the  
justice of another. Wherefore it is unbecoming that persons of ill 
repute, unbelievers, and those who have been convicted of grievous crimes 
should be advocates. Nevertheless this unbecomingness is outweighed by 
necessity: and for this reason such persons can plead either their own 
cause or that of persons closely connected with them. Moreover, clerics 
can be advocates in the cause of their own church, and monks in the cause 
of their own monastery, if the abbot direct them to do so.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Certain persons are sometimes debarred by unbecomingness, 
and others by inability from performing works of mercy: for not all the 
works of mercy are becoming to all persons: thus it ill becomes a fool to 
give counsel, or the ignorant to teach.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as virtue is destroyed by "too much" and "too little," 
so does a person become incompetent by "more" and "less." For this reason 
some, like religious and clerics, are debarred from pleading in causes, 
because they are above such an office; and others because they are less 
than competent to exercise it, such as persons of ill-repute and 
unbelievers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The necessity of pleading the causes of others is not so 
pressing as the necessity of pleading one's own cause, because others are 
able to help themselves otherwise: hence the comparison fails.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether an advocate sins by defending an unjust cause?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an advocate does not sin by defending an 
unjust cause. For just as a physician proves his skill by healing a 
desperate disease, so does an advocate prove his skill, if he can defend 
an unjust cause. Now a physician is praised if he heals a desperate 
malady. Therefore an advocate also commits no sin, but ought to be 
praised, if he defends an unjust cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is always lawful to desist from committing a sin. Yet 
an advocate is punished if he throws up his brief (Decret. II, qu. iii, 
can. Si quem poenit.). Therefore an advocate does not sin by defending an 
unjust cause, when once he has undertaken its defense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it would seem to be a greater sin for an advocate to use 
unjust means in defense of a just cause (e.g. by producing false 
witnesses, or alleging false laws), than to defend an unjust cause, since 
the former is a sin against the form, the latter against the matter of 
justice. Yet it is seemingly lawful for an advocate to make use of such 
underhand means, even as it is lawful for a soldier to lay ambushes in a 
battle. Therefore it would seem that an advocate does not sin by 
defending an unjust cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (2 Paralip. 19:2): "Thou helpest  the 
ungodly . . . and therefore thou didst deserve . . . the wrath of the 
Lord." Now an advocate by defending an unjust cause, helps the ungodly. 
Therefore he sins and deserves the wrath of the Lord.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is unlawful to cooperate in an evil deed, by 
counseling, helping, or in any way consenting, because to counsel or 
assist an action is, in a way, to do it, and the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A32">Rm. 1:32</a>) 
that "they . . . are worthy of death, not only they that do" a sin, "but 
they also that consent to them that do" it. Hence it was stated above 
(<A Href="SS062.html#SSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="SS062.html#SSQ62A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), that all such are bound to restitution. Now it is evident 
that an advocate provides both assistance and counsel to the party for 
whom he pleads. Wherefore, if knowingly he defends an unjust cause, 
without doubt he sins grievously, and is bound to restitution of the loss 
unjustly incurred by the other party by reason of the assistance he has 
provided. If, however, he defends an unjust cause unknowingly, thinking 
it just, he is to be excused according to the measure in which ignorance 
is excusable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The physician injures no man by undertaking to heal a 
desperate malady, whereas the advocate who accepts service in an unjust 
cause, unjustly injures the party against whom he pleads unjustly. Hence 
the comparison fails. For though he may seem to deserve praise for 
showing skill in his art, nevertheless he sins by reason of injustice in 
his will, since he abuses his art for an evil end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If an advocate believes from the outset that the cause is 
just, and discovers afterwards while the case is proceeding that it is 
unjust, he ought not to throw up his brief in such a way as to help the 
other side, or so as to reveal the secrets of his client to the other 
party. But he can and must give up the case, or induce his client to give 
way, or make some compromise without prejudice to the opposing party.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS040.html#SSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="SS040.html#SSQ40A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), it is lawful for a soldier, 
or a general to lay ambushes in a just war, by prudently concealing what 
he has a mind to do, but not by means of fraudulent falsehoods, since we 
should keep faith even with a foe, as Tully says (De offic. iii, 29). 
Hence it is lawful for an advocate, in defending his case, prudently to 
conceal whatever might hinder its happy issue, but it is unlawful for him 
to employ any kind of falsehood.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is lawful for an advocate to take a fee for pleading?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful for an advocate to take a fee for 
pleading. Works of mercy should not be done with a view to human 
remuneration, according to Lk. 14:12, "When thou makest a dinner or a 
supper, call not thy friends . . . nor thy neighbors who are rich: lest 
perhaps they also invite thee again, and a recompense be made to thee." 
Now it is a work of mercy to plead another's cause, as stated above (<A Href="SS071.html#SSQ71A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore it is not lawful  for an advocate to take payment in money 
for pleading.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, spiritual things are not to be bartered with temporal 
things. But pleading a person's cause seems to be a spiritual good since 
it consists in using one's knowledge of law. Therefore it is not lawful 
for an advocate to take a fee for pleading.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the person of the advocate concurs towards the 
pronouncement of the verdict, so do the persons of the judge and of the 
witness. Now, according to Augustine (Ep. cliii ad Macedon.), "the judge 
should not sell a just sentence, nor the witness true evidence." 
Therefore neither can an advocate sell a just pleading.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Ep. cliii ad Macedon.) that "an 
advocate may lawfully sell his pleading, and a lawyer his advice."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A man may justly receive payment for granting what he is 
not bound to grant. Now it is evident that an advocate is not always 
bound to consent to plead, or to give advice in other people's causes. 
Wherefore, if he sell his pleading or advice, he does not act against 
justice. The same applies to the physician who attends on a sick person 
to heal him, and to all like persons; provided, however, they take a 
moderate fee, with due consideration for persons, for the matter in hand, 
for the labor entailed, and for the custom of the country. If, however, 
they wickedly extort an immoderate fee, they sin against justice. Hence 
Augustine says (Ep. cliii ad Macedon.) that "it is customary to demand 
from them restitution of what they have extorted by a wicked excess, but 
not what has been given to them in accordance with a commendable custom."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Man is not bound to do gratuitously whatever he can do from 
motives of mercy: else no man could lawfully sell anything, since 
anything may be given from motives of mercy. But when a man does give a 
thing out of mercy, he should seek, not a human, but a Divine reward. In 
like manner an advocate, when he mercifully pleads the cause of a poor 
man, should have in view not a human but a Divine meed; and yet he is not 
always bound to give his services gratuitously.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Though knowledge of law is something spiritual, the use of 
that knowledge is accomplished by the work of the body: hence it is 
lawful to take money in payment of that use, else no craftsman would be

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[71] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The judge and witnesses are common to either party, since 
the judge is bound to pronounce a just verdict, and the witness to give 
true evidence. Now justice and truth do not incline to one side rather 
than to the other: and consequently judges receive out of the public 
funds a fixed pay for their labor; and witnesses receive their expenses 
(not as payment for giving  evidence, but as a fee for their labor) 
either from both parties or from the party by whom they are adduced, 
because no man "serveth as a soldier at any time at his own charge 
[*Vulg.: 'Who serveth as a soldier,']" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++9%3A7">1 Cor. 9:7</a>). On the other hand an 
advocate defends one party only, and so he may lawfully accept fee from 
the party he assists.<br>
