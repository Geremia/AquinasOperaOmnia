</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that patience is not a virtue. For the virtues are most 
perfect in heaven, as Augustine says (De Trin. xiv). Yet patience is not 
there, since no evils have to be borne there, according to Is. 49:10 and 
Apoc. 7:16, "They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor 
the sun strike them." Therefore patience is not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no virtue can be found in the wicked, since virtue it is 
"that makes its possessor good." Yet patience is sometimes found in 
wicked men; for instance, in the covetous, who bear many evils patiently 
that they may amass money, according to Eccles. 5:16, "All the days of 
his life he eateth in darkness, and in many cares, and in misery and in 
sorrow." Therefore patience is not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the fruits differ from the virtues, as stated above (FS, 
Question [70], Article [1], ad 3). But patience is reckoned among the fruits (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5%3A22">Gal. 5:22</a>). Therefore patience is not a virtue.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Patientia i): "The virtue of the 
soul that is called patience, is so great a gift of God, that we even 
preach the patience of Him who bestows it upon us."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the moral virtues are 
directed to the good, inasmuch as they safeguard the good of reason 
against the impulse of the passions. Now among the passions sorrow is 
strong to hinder the good of reason, according to 2 Cor. 7:10, "The 
sorrow of the world worketh death," and Ecclus. 30:25, "Sadness hath 
killed many, and there is no profit in it." Hence the necessity for a 
virtue to safeguard the good of reason against sorrow, lest reason give 
way to sorrow: and this patience does. Wherefore Augustine says (De 
Patientia ii): "A man's patience it is whereby he bears evil with an 
equal mind," i.e. without being disturbed by sorrow, "lest he abandon 
with an unequal mind the goods whereby he may advance to better things." 
It is therefore  evident that patience is a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The moral virtues do not remain in heaven as regards the 
same act that they have on the way, in relation, namely, to the goods of 
the present life, which will not remain in heaven: but they will remain 
in their relation to the end, which will be in heaven. Thus justice will 
not be in heaven in relation to buying and selling and other matters 
pertaining to the present life, but it will remain in the point of being 
subject to God. In like manner the act of patience, in heaven, will not 
consist in bearing things, but in enjoying the goods to which we had 
aspired by suffering. Hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv) that 
"patience itself will not be in heaven, since there is no need for it 
except where evils have to be borne: yet that which we shall obtain by 
patience will be eternal."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Patientia ii; v) "properly speaking 
those are patient who would rather bear evils without inflicting them, 
than inflict them without bearing them. As for those who bear evils that 
they may inflict evil, their patience is neither marvelous nor 
praiseworthy, for it is no patience at all: we may marvel at their 
hardness of heart, but we must refuse to call them patient."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS011.html#FSQ11OUTP1">Question [11]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS011.html#FSQ11A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the very notion of fruit 
denotes pleasure. And works of virtue afford pleasure in themselves, as 
stated in Ethic. i, 8. Now the names of the virtues are wont to be 
applied to their acts. Wherefore patience as a habit is a virtue. but as 
to the pleasure which its act affords, it is reckoned a fruit, especially 
in this, that patience safeguards the mind from being overcome by sorrow.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether patience is the greatest of the virtues?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that patience is the greatest of the virtues. For in 
every genus that which is perfect is the greatest. Now "patience hath a 
perfect work" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+1%3A4">James 1:4</a>). Therefore patience is the greatest of the 
virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, all the virtues are directed to the good of the soul. 
Now this seems to belong chiefly to patience; for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++21%3A19">Lk. 21:19</a>): "In your patience you shall possess your souls." Therefore 
patience is the greatest of the virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, seemingly that which is the safeguard and cause of other 
things is greater than they are. But according to Gregory (Hom. xxxv in 
Evang.) "patience is the root and safeguard of all the virtues." 
Therefore patience is the greatest of the virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is not reckoned among the four virtues which Gregory 
(Moral. xxii) and Augustine (De Morib. Eccl. xv) call principal. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Virtues by their very nature are directed to good. For it 
is virtue that "makes its possessor good, and renders the latter's work 
good" (Ethic. ii, 6). Hence it follows that a virtue's superiority and 
preponderance over other virtues is the greater according as it inclines 
man to good more effectively and directly. Now those virtues which are 
effective of good, incline a man more directly to good than those which 
are a check on the things which lead man away from good: and just as 
among those that are effective of good, the greater is that which 
establishes man in a greater good (thus faith, hope, and charity /are 
greater than prudence and justice); so too among those that are a check 
on things that withdraw man from good, the greater virtue is the one 
which is a check on a greater obstacle to good. But dangers of death, 
about which is fortitude, and pleasures of touch, with which temperance 
is concerned, withdraw man from good more than any kind of hardship, 
which is the object of patience. Therefore patience is not the greatest 
of the virtues, but falls short, not only of the theological virtues, and 
of prudence and justice which directly establish man in good, but also of 
fortitude and temperance which withdraw him from greater obstacles to 
good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Patience is said to have a perfect work in bearing 
hardships: for these give rise first to sorrow, which is moderated by 
patience; secondly, to anger, which is moderated by meekness; thirdly, to 
hatred, which charity removes; fourthly, to unjust injury, which justice 
forbids. Now that which removes the principle is the most perfect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet it does not follow, if patience be more perfect in this respect, 
that it is more perfect simply.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Possession denotes undisturbed ownership; wherefore man is 
said to possess his soul by patience, in so far as it removes by the root 
the passions that are evoked by hardships and disturb the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Patience is said to be the root and safeguard of all the 
virtues, not as though it caused and preserved them directly, but merely 
because it removes their obstacles.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it is possible to have patience without grace. For 
the more his reason inclines to a thing, the more is it possible for the 
rational creature to accomplish it. Now it is more reasonable to suffer 
evil for the sake of good than for the sake of evil. Yet some suffer evil 
for evil's sake, by their own virtue and without the help of grace; for 
Augustine says (De Patientia iii) that "men endure many toils and sorrows 
for the sake of the things they love sinfully." Much more, therefore, is 
it possible for man, without the help of grace, to bear evil for the sake 
of good, and this is to be truly patient. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, some who are not in a state of grace have more 
abhorrence for sinful evils than for bodily evils: hence some heathens 
are related to have endured many hardships rather than betray their 
country or commit some other misdeed. Now this is to be truly patient. 
Therefore it seems that it is possible to have patience without the help 
of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is quite evident that some go through much trouble 
and pain in order to regain health of the body. Now the health of the 
soul is not less desirable than bodily health. Therefore in like manner 
one may, without the help of grace, endure many evils for the health of 
the soul, and this is to be truly patient.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++61%3A6">Ps. 61:6</a>): "From Him," i.e. from God, 
"is my patience."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Patientia iv), "the strength of 
desire helps a man to bear toil and pain: and no one willingly undertakes 
to bear what is painful, save for the sake of that which gives pleasure." 
The reason of this is because sorrow and pain are of themselves 
displeasing to the soul, wherefore it would never choose to suffer them 
for their own sake, but only for the sake of an end. Hence it follows 
that the good for the sake of which one is willing to endure evils, is 
more desired and loved than the good the privation of which causes the 
sorrow that we bear patiently. Now the fact that a man prefers the good 
of grace to all natural goods, the loss of which may cause sorrow, is to 
be referred to charity, which loves God above all things. Hence it is 
evident that patience, as a virtue, is caused by charity, according to 1 
Cor. 13:4, "Charity is patient."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is manifest that it is impossible to have charity save through 
grace, according to Rm. 5:5, "The charity of God is poured forth in our 
hearts by the Holy Ghost Who is given to us." Therefore it is clearly 
impossible to have patience without the help of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The inclination of reason would prevail in human nature in 
the state of integrity. But in corrupt nature the inclination of 
concupiscence prevails, because it is dominant in man. Hence man is more 
prone to bear evils for the sake of goods in which the concupiscence 
delights here and now, than to endure evils for the sake of goods to 
come, which are desired in accordance with reason: and yet it is this 
that pertains to true patience.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The good of a social virtue [*Cf. FS, Question [61], Article [5]] is 
commensurate with human nature; and consequently the human will can tend 
thereto without the help of sanctifying grace, yet not without the help 
of God's grace [*Cf. FS, Question [109], Article [2]]. On the other hand, the good of 
grace is supernatural, wherefore man cannot tend thereto by a natural 
virtue. Hence the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even the endurance of those evils which a man bears for the 
sake of his body's health, proceeds from the love a man naturally has for 
his own flesh. Hence there is no comparison between this endurance and 
patience which proceeds from a supernatural love.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that patience is not a part of fortitude. For a thing is 
not part of itself. Now patience is apparently the same as fortitude: 
because, as stated above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), the proper act of fortitude is 
to endure; and this belongs also to patience. For it is stated in the 
Liber Sententiarum Prosperi [*The quotation is from St. Gregory, Hom. 
xxxv in Evang.] that "patience consists in enduring evils inflicted by 
others." Therefore patience is not a part of fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, fortitude is about fear and daring, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), and thus it is in the irascible. But patience seems to be 
about sorrow, and consequently would seem to be in the concupiscible. 
Therefore patience is not a part of fortitude but of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the whole cannot be without its part. Therefore if 
patience is a part of fortitude, there can be no fortitude without 
patience. Yet sometimes a brave man does not endure evils patiently, but 
even attacks the person who inflicts the evil. Therefore patience is not 
a part of fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) reckons it a part of 
fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Patience is a quasi-potential part of fortitude, because 
it is annexed thereto as secondary to principal virtue. For it belongs to 
patience "to suffer with an equal mind the evils inflicted by others," as 
Gregory says in a homily (xxxv in Evang.). Now of those evils that are 
inflicted by others, foremost and most difficult to endure are those that 
are connected with the danger of death, and about these evils fortitude 
is concerned. Hence it is clear that in this matter fortitude has the 
principal place, and that it lays claim to that which is principal in 
this matter. Wherefore patience is annexed to fortitude as secondary to 
principal virtue, for which reason Prosper calls patience brave (Sent. 
811).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It belongs to fortitude to endure, not anything indeed, but 
that which is most difficult to endure, namely dangers of death: whereas 
it may pertain to patience to endure any kind of evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The act of fortitude consists not only in holding fast to 
good against the fear of future dangers, but also in not failing through 
sorrow or pain occasioned by things present; and it  is in the latter 
respect that patience is akin to fortitude. Yet fortitude is chiefly 
about fear, which of itself evokes flight which fortitude avoids; while 
patience is chiefly about sorrow, for a man is said to be patient, not 
because he does not fly, but because he behaves in a praiseworthy manner 
by suffering [patiendo] things which hurt him here and now, in such a way 
as not to be inordinately saddened by them. Hence fortitude is properly 
in the irascible, while patience is in the concupiscible faculty.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor does this hinder patience from being a part of fortitude, because 
the annexing of virtue to virtue does not regard the subject, but the 
matter or the form. Nevertheless patience is not to be reckoned a part of 
temperance, although both are in the concupiscible, because temperance is 
only about those sorrows that are opposed to pleasures of touch, such as 
arise through abstinence from pleasures of food and sex: whereas patience 
is chiefly about sorrows inflicted by other persons. Moreover it belongs 
to temperance to control these sorrows besides their contrary pleasures: 
whereas it belongs to patience that a man forsake not the good of virtue 
on account of such like sorrows, however great they be.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It may be granted that patience in a certain respect is an 
integral part of justice, if we consider the fact that a man may 
patiently endure evils pertaining to dangers of death; and it is from 
this point of view that the objection argues. Nor is it inconsistent with 
patience that a man should, when necessary, rise up against the man who 
inflicts evils on him; for Chrysostom [*Homily v. in the Opus 
Imperfectum, falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom] says on Mt. 4:10, 
"Begone Satan," that "it is praiseworthy to be patient under our own 
wrongs, but to endure God's wrongs patiently is most wicked": and 
Augustine says in a letter to Marcellinus (Ep. cxxxviii) that "the 
precepts of patience are not opposed to the good of the commonwealth, 
since in order to ensure that good we fight against our enemies." But in 
so far as patience regards all kinds of evils, it is annexed to fortitude 
as secondary to principal virtue.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether patience is the same as longanimity? [*Longsuffering. It is necessary to preserve the Latin word, on account of the comparison with magnanimity.]<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that patience is the same as longanimity. For Augustine 
says (De Patientia i) that "we speak of patience in God, not as though 
any evil made Him suffer, but because He awaits the wicked, that they may 
be converted." Wherefore it is written (Ecclus. 5:4): "The Most High is a 
patient rewarder." Therefore it seems that patience is the same as 
longanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the same thing is not contrary to two things. But 
impatience is contrary to longanimity, whereby one awaits a delay: for 
one is said to be impatient of delay, as of other evils. Therefore it 
seems that patience is the same as longanimity. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as time is a circumstance of wrongs endured, so is 
place. But no virtue is distinct from patience on the score of place. 
Therefore in like manner longanimity which takes count of time, in so far 
as a person waits for a long time, is not distinct from patience.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[5] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> On the contrary, a gloss [*Origen, Comment. in Ep. ad Rom. ii] on 
Rm. 2:4, "Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and patience, and 
longsuffering?" says: "It seems that longanimity differs from patience, 
because those who offend from weakness rather than of set purpose are 
said to be borne with longanimity: while those who take a deliberate 
delight in their crimes are said to be borne patiently."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[5] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Just as by magnanimity a man has a mind to tend to great 
things, so by longanimity a man has a mind to tend to something a long 
way off. Wherefore as magnanimity regards hope, which tends to good, 
rather than daring, fear, or sorrow, which have evil as their object, so 
also does longanimity. Hence longanimity has more in common with 
magnanimity than with patience.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[5] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless it may have something in common with patience, for two 
reasons. First, because patience, like fortitude, endures certain evils 
for the sake of good, and if this good is awaited shortly, endurance is 
easier: whereas if it be delayed a long time, it is more difficult. 
Secondly, because the very delay of the good we hope for, is of a nature 
to cause sorrow, according to Prov. 13:12, "Hope that is deferred 
afflicteth the soul." Hence there may be patience in bearing this trial, 
as in enduring any other sorrows. Accordingly longanimity and constancy 
are both comprised under patience, in so far as both the delay of the 
hoped for good (which regards longanimity) and the toil which man endures 
in persistently accomplishing a good work (which regards constancy) may 
be considered under the one aspect of grievous evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[5] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) in defining patience, says 
that "patience is the voluntary and prolonged endurance of arduous and 
difficult things for the sake of virtue or profit." By saying "arduous" 
he refers to constancy in good; when he says "difficult" he refers to the 
grievousness of evil, which is the proper object of patience; and by 
adding "continued" or "long lasting," he refers to longanimity, in so far 
as it has something in common with patience.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[5] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Replies to the First and Second Objections.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That which is a long way off as to place, though distant 
from us, is not simply distant from things in nature, as that which is a 
long way off in point of time: hence the comparison fails. Moreover, what 
is remote as to place offers no difficulty save in the point of time, 
since what is placed a long way from us is a long time coming to us. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[136] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We grant the fourth argument. We must observe, however, that the reason 
for the difference assigned by this gloss is that it is hard to bear with 
those who sin through weakness, merely because they persist a long time 
in evil, wherefore it is said that they are borne with longanimity: 
whereas the very fact of sinning through pride seems to be unendurable; 
for which reason those who sin through pride are stated to be borne with 
patience.<br>
