OF TEMPERANCE (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next place we must consider temperance: (1) Temperance itself; 
(2) its parts; (3) its precepts. With regard to temperance we must 
consider (1) temperance itself; (2) the contrary vices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether temperance is a virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a special virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is only about desires and pleasures?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is only about pleasures of touch?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether it is about pleasures of taste, as such, or only as a kind 
of touch?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A6THEP1">(6)</a> What is the rule of temperance?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether it is a cardinal, or principal, virtue?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that temperance is not a virtue. For no virtue goes 
against the inclination of nature, since "there is in us a natural 
aptitude for virtue," as stated in Ethic. ii, 1. Now temperance withdraws 
us from pleasures to which nature inclines, according to Ethic. ii, 3,8. 
Therefore temperance is not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, virtues are connected with one another, as stated above 
(<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But some people have temperance without having the 
other virtues: for we find many who are temperate, and yet covetous or 
timid. Therefore temperance is not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to every virtue there is a corresponding gift, as 
appears from what we have said above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But seemingly no 
gift corresponds to temperance, since all the gifts  have been already 
ascribed to the other virtues (<A Href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [8]</a>,9,19,45,52, 71,139). Therefore 
temperance is not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Music. vi, 15): "Temperance is the name 
of a virtue."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), it is essential to 
virtue to incline man to good. Now the good of man is to be in accordance 
with reason, as Dionysius states (Div. Nom. iv). Hence human virtue is 
that which inclines man to something in accordance with reason. Now 
temperance evidently inclines man to this, since its very name implies 
moderation or temperateness, which reason causes. Therefore temperance is 
a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Nature inclines everything to whatever is becoming to it. 
Wherefore man naturally desires pleasures that are becoming to him. 
Since, however, man as such is a rational being, it follows that those 
pleasures are becoming to man which are in accordance with reason. From 
such pleasures temperance does not withdraw him, but from those which are 
contrary to reason. Wherefore it is clear that temperance is not contrary 
to the inclination of human nature, but is in accord with it. It is, 
however, contrary to the inclination of the animal nature that is not 
subject to reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The temperance which fulfils the conditions of perfect 
virtue is not without prudence, while this is lacking to all who are in 
sin. Hence those who lack other virtues, through being subject to the 
opposite vices, have not the temperance which is a virtue, though they do 
acts of temperance from a certain natural disposition, in so far as 
certain imperfect virtues are either natural to man, as stated above (FS, 
Question [63], Article [1]), or acquired by habituation, which virtues, through lack of 
prudence, are not perfected by reason, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Temperance also has a corresponding gift, namely, fear, 
whereby man is withheld from the pleasures of the flesh, according to Ps. 
118:120: "Pierce Thou my flesh with Thy fear." The gift of fear has for 
its principal object God, Whom it avoids offending, and in this respect 
it corresponds to the virtue of hope, as stated above (<A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>, ad 1). But it may have for its secondary object whatever a man shuns in 
order to avoid offending God. Now man stands in the greatest need of the 
fear of God in order to shun those things which are most seductive, and 
these are the matter of temperance: wherefore the gift of fear 
corresponds to temperance also.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether temperance is a special virtue?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that temperance is not a special virtue. For 
Augustine says (De Morib. Eccl. xv) that "it belongs to temperance to 
preserve one's integrity and freedom from corruption for God's sake." But 
this is common to every virtue. Therefore  temperance is not a special 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 42) that "what we observe and 
seek most in temperance is tranquillity of soul." But this is common to 
every virtue. Therefore temperance is not a special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Tully says (De Offic. i, 27) that "we cannot separate 
the beautiful from the virtuous," and that "whatever is just is 
beautiful." Now the beautiful is considered as proper to temperance, 
according to the same authority (Tully, De Offic. i, 27). Therefore 
temperance is not a special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 7; iii, 10) reckons it a 
special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is customary in human speech to employ a common term 
in a restricted sense in order to designate the principal things to which 
that common term is applicable: thus the word "city" is used 
antonomastically* to designate Rome. [*Antonomasia is the figure of 
speech whereby we substitute the general for the individual term; e.g. 
The Philosopher for Aristotle]. Accordingly the word "temperance" has a 
twofold acceptation. First, in accordance with its common signification: 
and thus temperance is not a special but a general virtue, because the 
word "temperance" signifies a certain temperateness or moderation, which 
reason appoints to human operations and passions: and this is common to 
every moral virtue. Yet there is a logical difference between temperance 
and fortitude, even if we take them both as general virtues: since 
temperance withdraws man from things which seduce the appetite from 
obeying reason, while fortitude incites him to endure or withstand those 
things on account of which he forsakes the good of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, if we take temperance antonomastically, as 
withholding the appetite from those things which are most seductive to 
man, it is a special virtue, for thus it has, like fortitude, a special 
matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Man's appetite is corrupted chiefly by those things which 
seduce him into forsaking the rule of reason and Divine law. Wherefore 
integrity, which Augustine ascribes to temperance, can, like the latter, 
be taken in two ways: first, in a general sense, and secondly in a sense 
of excellence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The things about which temperance is concerned have a most 
disturbing effect on the soul, for the reason that they are natural to 
man, as we shall state further on (<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5). Hence tranquillity of soul 
is ascribed to temperance by way of excellence, although it is a common 
property of all the virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although beauty is becoming to every virtue, it is ascribed 
to temperance, by way of excellence, for two reasons. First, in respect 
of the generic notion of temperance, which  consists in a certain 
moderate and fitting proportion, and this is what we understand by 
beauty, as attested by Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv). Secondly, because the 
things from which temperance withholds us, hold the lowest place in man, 
and are becoming to him by reason of his animal nature, as we shall state 
further on (<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5; <A Href="SS142.html#SSQ142OUTP1">Question [142]</a>, <A Href="SS142.html#SSQ142A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), wherefore it is natural that such 
things should defile him. In consequence beauty is a foremost attribute 
of temperance which above all hinders man from being defiled. In like 
manner honesty [*Honesty must be taken here in its broad sense as 
synonymous with moral goodness, from the point of view of decorum] is a 
special attribute of temperance: for Isidore says (Etym. x): "An honest 
man is one who has no defilement, for honesty means an honorable state." 
This is most applicable to temperance, which withstands the vices that 
bring most dishonor on man, as we shall state further on (<A Href="SS142.html#SSQ142OUTP1">Question [142]</a>, <A Href="SS142.html#SSQ142A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether temperance is only about desires and pleasures?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that temperance is not only about desires and 
pleasures. For Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) that "temperance is 
reason's firm and moderate mastery of lust and other wanton emotions of 
the mind." Now all the passions of the soul are called emotions of the 
mind. Therefore it seems that temperance is not only about desires and 
pleasures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "Virtue is about the difficult and the good" [*Ethic. 
ii, 3]. Now it seems more difficult to temper fear, especially with 
regard to dangers of death, than to moderate desires and pleasures, which 
are despised on account of deadly pains and dangers, according to 
Augustine (<A Href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [83]</a>, qu. 36). Therefore it seems that the virtue of 
temperance is not chiefly about desires and pleasures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Ambrose (De Offic. i, 43) "the grace of 
moderation belongs to temperance": and Tully says (De Offic. ii, 27) that 
"it is the concern of temperance to calm all disturbances of the mind and 
to enforce moderation." Now moderation is needed, not only in desires and 
pleasures, but also in external acts and whatever pertains to the 
exterior. Therefore temperance is not only about desires and pleasures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says (Etym.) [*The words quoted do not occur in 
the work referred to; Cf. his De Summo Bono xxxvii, xlii, and De 
Different. ii, 39]: that "it is temperance whereby lust and desire are 
kept under control."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[3] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>; <A Href="SS136.html#SSQ136OUTP1">Question [136]</a>, <A Href="SS136.html#SSQ136A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it belongs 
to moral virtue to safeguard the good of reason against the passions that 
rebel against reason. Now the movement of the soul's passions is twofold, 
as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), when we were treating of the passions: 
the one, whereby the sensitive appetite pursues sensible and bodily 
goods, the other whereby it flies from sensible and bodily evils. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[3] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first of these movements of the sensitive appetite rebels against 
reason chiefly by lack of moderation. Because sensible and bodily goods, 
considered in their species, are not in opposition to reason, but are 
subject to it as instruments which reason employs in order to attain its 
proper end: and that they are opposed to reason is owing to the fact that 
the sensitive appetite fails to tend towards them in accord with the mode 
of reason. Hence it belongs properly to moral virtue to moderate those 
passions which denote a pursuit of the good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[3] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the movement of the sensitive appetite in flying from 
sensible evil is mostly in opposition to reason, not through being 
immoderate, but chiefly in respect of its flight: because, when a man 
flies from sensible and bodily evils, which sometimes accompany the good 
of reason, the result is that he flies from the good of reason. Hence it 
belongs to moral virtue to make man while flying from evil to remain firm 
in the good of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[3] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, just as the virtue of fortitude, which by its very nature 
bestows firmness, is chiefly concerned with the passion, viz. fear, which 
regards flight from bodily evils, and consequently with daring, which 
attacks the objects of fear in the hope of attaining some good, so, too, 
temperance, which denotes a kind of moderation, is chiefly concerned with 
those passions that tend towards sensible goods, viz. desire and 
pleasure, and consequently with the sorrows that arise from the absence 
of those pleasures. For just as daring presupposes objects of fear, so 
too such like sorrow arises from the absence of the aforesaid pleasures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS025.html#FSQ25A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), when 
we were treating of the passions, those passions which pertain to 
avoidance of evil, presuppose the passions pertaining to the pursuit of 
good; and the passions of the irascible presuppose the passions of the 
concupiscible. Hence, while temperance directly moderates the passions of 
the concupiscible which tend towards good, as a consequence, it moderates 
all the other passions, inasmuch as moderation of the passions that 
precede results in moderation of the passions that follow: since he that 
is not immoderate in desire is moderate in hope, and grieves moderately 
for the absence of the things he desires.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Desire denotes an impulse of the appetite towards the 
object of pleasure and this impulse needs control, which belongs to 
temperance. on the other hand fear denotes a withdrawal of the mind from 
certain evils, against which man needs firmness of mind, which fortitude 
bestows. Hence temperance is properly about desires, and fortitude about 
fears.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> External acts proceed from the internal passions of the 
soul: wherefore their moderation depends on the moderation of the 
internal passions.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether temperance is only about desires and pleasures of touch?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that temperance is not only about desires and 
pleasures of touch. For Augustine says (De Morib. Eccl. xix) that "the 
function of temperance is to control and quell the desires which draw us 
to the things which withdraw us from the laws of God and from the fruit 
of His goodness"; and a little further on he adds that "it is the duty of 
temperance to spurn all bodily allurements and popular praise." Now we 
are withdrawn from God's laws not only by the desire for pleasures of 
touch, but also by the desire for pleasures of the other senses, for 
these, too, belong to the bodily allurements, and again by the desire for 
riches or for worldly glory: wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++6:10">1 Tim. 6:10</a>). 
"Desire [*'Cupiditas,' which is the Douay version following the Greek 
{philargyria} renders 'desire of money'] is the root of all evils." 
Therefore temperance is not only about desires of pleasures of touch.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 3) that "one who is 
worthy of small things and deems himself worthy of them is temperate, but 
he is not magnificent." Now honors, whether small or great, of which he 
is speaking there, are an object of pleasure, not of touch, but in the 
soul's apprehension. Therefore temperance is not only about desires for 
pleasures of touch.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things that are of the same genus would seem to pertain 
to the matter of a particular virtue under one same aspect. Now all 
pleasures of sense are apparently of the same genus. Therefore they all 
equally belong to the matter of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, spiritual pleasures are greater than the pleasures of 
the body, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS031.html#FSQ31OUTP1">Question [31]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS031.html#FSQ31A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>) in the treatise on the 
passions. Now sometimes men forsake God's laws and the state of virtue 
through desire for spiritual pleasures, for instance, through curiosity 
in matters of knowledge: wherefore the devil promised man knowledge, 
saying (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++3:5">Gn. 3:5</a>): "Ye shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil." Therefore 
temperance is not only about pleasures of touch.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[4] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, if pleasures of touch were the proper matter of 
temperance, it would follow that temperance is about all pleasures of 
touch. But it is not about all, for instance, about those which occur in 
games. Therefore pleasures of touch are not the proper matter of 
temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 10) that "temperance 
is properly about desires of pleasures of touch."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), temperance is about desires and 
pleasures in the same way as fortitude is about fear and daring. Now 
fortitude is about fear and daring with respect to the greatest evils 
whereby nature itself is dissolved; and such are  dangers of death. 
Wherefore in like manner temperance must needs be about desires for the 
greatest pleasures. And since pleasure results from a natural operation, 
it is so much the greater according as it results from a more natural 
operation. Now to animals the most natural operations are those which 
preserve the nature of the individual by means of meat and drink, and the 
nature of the species by the union of the sexes. Hence temperance is 
properly about pleasures of meat and drink and sexual pleasures. Now 
these pleasures result from the sense of touch. Wherefore it follows that 
temperance is about pleasures of touch.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the passage quoted Augustine apparently takes 
temperance, not as a special virtue having a determinate matter, but as 
concerned with the moderation of reason, in any matter whatever: and this 
is a general condition of every virtue. However, we may also reply that 
if a man can control the greatest pleasures, much more can he control 
lesser ones. Wherefore it belongs chiefly and properly to temperance to 
moderate desires and pleasures of touch, and secondarily other pleasures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Philosopher takes temperance as denoting moderation in 
external things, when, to wit, a man tends to that which is proportionate 
to him, but not as denoting moderation in the soul's emotions, which 
pertains to the virtue of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The pleasures of the other senses play a different part in 
man and in other animals. For in other animals pleasures do not result 
from the other senses save in relation to sensibles of touch: thus the 
lion is pleased to see the stag, or to hear its voice, in relation to his 
food. On the other hand man derives pleasure from the other senses, not 
only for this reason, but also on account of the becomingness of the 
sensible object. Wherefore temperance is about the pleasures of the other 
senses, in relation to pleasures of touch, not principally but 
consequently: while in so far as the sensible objects of the other senses 
are pleasant on account of their becomingness, as when a man is pleased 
at a well-harmonized sound, this pleasure has nothing to do with the 
preservation of nature. Hence these passions are not of such importance 
that temperance can be referred to them antonomastically.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although spiritual pleasures are by their nature greater 
than bodily pleasures, they are not so perceptible to the senses, and 
consequently they do not so strongly affect the sensitive appetite, 
against whose impulse the good of reason is safeguarded by moral virtue. 
We may also reply that spiritual pleasures, strictly speaking, are in 
accordance with reason, wherefore they need no control, save 
accidentally, in so far as one spiritual pleasure is a hindrance to 
another greater and more binding.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Not all pleasures of touch regard the preservation of 
nature, and consequently it does not follow that temperance is about all 
pleasures of touch.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether temperance is about the pleasures proper to the taste?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that temperance is about pleasures proper to the 
taste. For pleasures of the taste result from food and drink, which are 
more necessary to man's life than sexual pleasures, which regard the 
touch. But according to what has been said (<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), temperance is about 
pleasures in things that are necessary to human life. Therefore 
temperance is about pleasures proper to the taste rather than about those 
proper to the touch.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, temperance is about the passions rather than about 
things themselves. Now, according to De Anima ii, 3, "the touch is the 
sense of food," as regards the very substance of the food, whereas 
"savor" which is the proper object of the taste, is "the pleasing quality 
of the food." Therefore temperance is about the taste rather than about 
the touch.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Ethic. vii, 4,7: "temperance and 
intemperance are about the same things, and so are continence and 
incontinence, perseverance, and effeminacy," to which delicacy pertains. 
Now delicacy seems to regard the delight taken in savors which are the 
object of the taste. Therefore temperance is about pleasures proper to 
the taste.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 10) that "seemingly 
temperance and intemperance have little if anything to do with the taste."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), temperance is about the greatest 
pleasures, which chiefly regard the preservation of human life either in 
the species or in the individual. In these matters certain things are to 
be considered as principal and others as secondary. The principal thing 
is the use itself of the necessary means, of the woman who is necessary 
for the preservation of the species, or of food and drink which are 
necessary for the preservation of the individual: while the very use of 
these necessary things has a certain essential pleasure annexed thereto.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In regard to either use we consider as secondary whatever makes the use 
more pleasurable, such as beauty and adornment in woman, and a pleasing 
savor and likewise odor in food. Hence temperance is chiefly about the 
pleasure of touch, that results essentially from the use of these 
necessary things, which use is in all cases attained by the touch. 
Secondarily, however, temperance and intemperance are about pleasures of 
the taste, smell, or sight, inasmuch as the sensible objects of these 
senses conduce to the pleasurable use of the necessary things that have 
relation to the touch. But since the taste is more akin to the touch than 
the other senses are, it follows that temperance is more about the taste 
than about the other senses.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The use of food and the pleasure that essentially results 
therefrom pertain to the touch. Hence the Philosopher says  (De Anima ii, 
3) that "touch is the sense of food, for food is hot or cold, wet or 
dry." To the taste belongs the discernment of savors, which make the food 
pleasant to eat, in so far as they are signs of its being suitable for 
nourishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The pleasure resulting from savor is additional, so to 
speak, whereas the pleasure of touch results essentially from the use of 
food and drink.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Delicacy regards principally the substance of the food, but 
secondarily it regards its delicious savor and the way in which it is 
served.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the rule of temperance depends on the need of the present life?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the rule of temperance does not depend on the 
needs of the present life. For higher things are not regulated according 
to lower. Now, as temperance is a virtue of the soul, it is above the 
needs of the body. Therefore the rule of temperance does not depend on 
the needs of the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever exceeds a rule sins. Therefore if the needs of 
the body were the rule of temperance, it would be a sin against 
temperance to indulge in any other pleasure than those required by 
nature, which is content with very little. But this would seem 
unreasonable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one sins in observing a rule. Therefore if the need 
of the body were the rule of temperance, there would be no sin in using 
any pleasure for the needs of the body, for instance, for the sake of 
health. But this is apparently false. Therefore the need of the body is 
not the rule of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Morib. Eccl. xxi): "In both 
Testaments the temperate man finds confirmation of the rule forbidding 
him to love the things of this life, or to deem any of them desirable for 
its own sake, and commanding him to avail himself of those things with 
the moderation of a user not the attachment of a lover, in so far as they 
are requisite for the needs of this life and of his station."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="SS109.html#SSQ109OUTP1">Question [109]</a>, <A Href="SS109.html#SSQ109A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>), the 
good of moral virtue consists chiefly in the order of reason: because 
"man's good is to be in accord with reason," as Dionysius asserts (Div. 
Nom. iv). Now the principal order of reason is that by which it directs 
certain things towards their end, and the good of reason consists chiefly 
in this order; since good has the aspect of end, and the end is the rule 
of whatever is directed to the end. Now all the pleasurable objects that 
are at man's disposal, are directed to some necessity of this life as to 
their end. Wherefore temperance takes the need of this life, as the rule 
of the pleasurable objects of which it makes use, and uses them only for  
as much as the need of this life requires.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above, the need of this life is regarded as a 
rule in so far as it is an end. Now it must be observed that sometimes 
the end of the worker differs from the end of the work, thus it is clear 
that the end of building is a house, whereas sometimes the end of the 
builder is profit. Accordingly the end and rule of temperance itself is 
happiness; while the end and rule of the thing it makes use of is the 
need of human life, to which whatever is useful for life is subordinate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The need of human life may be taken in two ways. First, it 
may be taken in the sense in which we apply the term "necessary" to that 
without which a thing cannot be at all; thus food is necessary to an 
animal. Secondly, it may be taken for something without which a thing 
cannot be becomingly. Now temperance regards not only the former of these 
needs, but also the latter. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 
11) that "the temperate man desires pleasant things for the sake of 
health, or for the sake of a sound condition of body." Other things that 
are not necessary for this purpose may be divided into two classes. For 
some are a hindrance to health and a sound condition of body; and these 
temperance makes not use of whatever, for this would be a sin against 
temperance. But others are not a hindrance to those things, and these 
temperance uses moderately, according to the demands of place and time, 
and in keeping with those among whom one dwells. Hence the Philosopher 
(Ethic. iii, 11) says that the "temperate man also desires other pleasant 
things," those namely that are not necessary for health or a sound 
condition of body, "so long as they are not prejudicial to these things."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated (ad 2), temperance regards need according to the 
requirements of life, and this depends not only on the requirements of 
the body, but also on the requirements of external things, such as riches 
and station, and more still on the requirements of good conduct. Hence 
the Philosopher adds (Ethic. iii, 11) that "the temperate man makes use 
of pleasant things provided that not only they be not prejudicial to 
health and a sound bodily condition, but also that they be not 
inconsistent with good," i.e. good conduct, nor "beyond his substance," 
i.e. his means. And Augustine says (De Morib. Eccl. xxi) that the 
"temperate man considers the need" not only "of this life" but also "of 
his station."<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that temperance is not a cardinal virtue. For the 
good of moral virtue depends on reason. But temperance is about those 
things that are furthest removed from reason, namely about pleasures 
common to us and the lower animals, as stated in Ethic. iii, 10. 
Therefore temperance, seemingly, is not a principal virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the greater the impetus the more difficult is it to 
control. Now anger, which is controlled by meekness, seems to be more 
impetuous than desire, which is controlled by temperance. For it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++27:4">Prov. 27:4</a>): "Anger hath no mercy, nor fury when it breaketh 
forth; and who can bear the violence [impetum] of one provoked?" 
Therefore meekness is a principal virtue rather than temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, hope as a movement of the soul takes precedence of 
desire and concupiscence, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS025.html#FSQ25A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But humility 
controls the presumption of immoderate hope. Therefore, seemingly, 
humility is a principal virtue rather than temperance which controls 
concupiscence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory reckons temperance among the principal virtues 
(Moral. ii, 49).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A11THEP1">Article [11]</a>; <A Href="SS061.html#SSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>, <A Href="SS061.html#SSQ61A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), a principal 
or cardinal virtue is so called because it has a foremost claim to praise 
on account of one of those things that are requisite for the notion of 
virtue in general. Now moderation, which is requisite in every virtue, 
deserves praise principally in pleasures of touch, with which temperance 
is concerned, both because these pleasures are most natural to us, so 
that it is more difficult to abstain from them, and to control the desire 
for them, and because their objects are more necessary to the present 
life, as stated above (<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). For this reason temperance is reckoned a 
principal or cardinal virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The longer the range of its operation, the greater is the 
agent's power [virtus] shown to be: wherefore the very fact that the 
reason is able to moderate desires and pleasures that are furthest 
removed from it, proves the greatness of reason's power. This is how 
temperance comes to be a principal virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The impetuousness of anger is caused by an accident, for 
instance, a painful hurt; wherefore it soon passes, although its impetus 
be great. On the other hand, the impetuousness of the desire for 
pleasures of touch proceeds from a natural cause, wherefore it is more 
lasting and more general, and consequently its control regards a more 
principal virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The object of hope is higher than the object of desire, 
wherefore hope is accounted the principal passion in the irascible. But 
the objects of desires and pleasures of touch move the appetite with 
greater force, since they are more natural. Therefore temperance, which 
appoints the mean in such things, is a principal virtue.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that temperance is the greatest of the virtues. For 
Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 43) that "what we observe  and seek most in 
temperance is the safeguarding of what is honorable, and the regard for 
what is beautiful." Now virtue deserves praise for being honorable and 
beautiful. Therefore temperance is the greatest of the virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the more difficult the deed the greater the virtue. Now 
it is more difficult to control desires and pleasures of touch than to 
regulate external actions, the former pertaining to temperance and the 
latter to justice. Therefore temperance is a greater virtue than justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, seemingly the more general a thing is, the more 
necessary and the better it is. Now fortitude is about dangers of death 
which occur less frequently than pleasures of touch, for these occur 
every day; so that temperance is in more general use than fortitude. 
Therefore temperance is a more excellent virtue than fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Rhet. i, 9) that the "greatest 
virtues are those which are most profitable to others, for which reason 
we give the greatest honor to the brave and the just."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the Philosopher declares (Ethic. i, 2) "the good of 
the many is more of the godlike than the good of the individual," 
wherefore the more a virtue regards the good of the many, the better it 
is. Now justice and fortitude regard the good of the many more than 
temperance does, since justice regards the relations between one man and 
another, while fortitude regards dangers of battle which are endured for 
the common weal: whereas temperance moderates only the desires and 
pleasures which affect man himself. Hence it is evident that justice and 
fortitude are more excellent virtues than temperance: while prudence and 
the theological virtues are more excellent still.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Honor and beauty are especially ascribed to temperance, not 
on account of the excellence of the good proper to temperance, but on 
account of the disgrace of the contrary evil from which it withdraws us, 
by moderating the pleasures common to us and the lower animals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since virtue is about the difficult and the good, the 
excellence of a virtue is considered more under the aspect of good, 
wherein justice excels, than under the aspect of difficult, wherein 
temperance excels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[141] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That which is general because it regards the many conduces 
more to the excellence of goodness than that which is general because it 
occurs frequently: fortitude excels in the former way, temperance in the 
latter. Hence fortitude is greater simply, although in some respects 
temperance may be described as greater not only than fortitude but also 
than justice.<br>
