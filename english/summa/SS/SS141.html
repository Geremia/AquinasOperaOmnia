    TEMPERANCE (Questions [141]-143)<br />
    <br />
    OF TEMPERANCE (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    In the next place we must consider temperance: (1) Temperance itself; (2)
    its parts; (3) its precepts. With regard to temperance we must consider (1)
    temperance itself; (2) the contrary vices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether temperance is a virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a special virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is only about desires
    and pleasures?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is only about
    pleasures of touch?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether it is about pleasures of
    taste, as such, or only as a kind of touch?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141A6THEP1">(6)</a> What is the rule of temperance?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether it is a cardinal, or
    principal, virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether it is the greatest of
    virtues ?

  <h3 align="left">Whether temperance is a virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that temperance is not a virtue. For no
    virtue goes against the inclination of nature, since "there is in us a
    natural aptitude for virtue," as stated in Ethic. ii, 1. Now temperance
    withdraws us from pleasures to which nature inclines, according to Ethic.
    ii, 3,8. Therefore temperance is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, virtues are connected with one another,
    as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But some people
    have temperance without having the other virtues: for we find many who are
    temperate, and yet covetous or timid. Therefore temperance is not a
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to every virtue there is a corresponding
    gift, as appears from what we have said above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But seemingly no
    gift corresponds to temperance, since all the gifts have been already
    ascribed to the other virtues (<a href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1"
      >Questions [8]</a
    >,9,19,45,52, 71,139). Therefore temperance is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Music. vi, 15): "Temperance
    is the name of a virtue."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), it is essential to
    virtue to incline man to good. Now the good of man is to be in accordance
    with reason, as Dionysius states (Div. Nom. iv). Hence human virtue is that
    which inclines man to something in accordance with reason. Now temperance
    evidently inclines man to this, since its very name implies moderation or
    temperateness, which reason causes. Therefore temperance is a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Nature inclines everything to whatever
    is becoming to it. Wherefore man naturally desires pleasures that are
    becoming to him. Since, however, man as such is a rational being, it follows
    that those pleasures are becoming to man which are in accordance with
    reason. From such pleasures temperance does not withdraw him, but from those
    which are contrary to reason. Wherefore it is clear that temperance is not
    contrary to the inclination of human nature, but is in accord with it. It
    is, however, contrary to the inclination of the animal nature that is not
    subject to reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The temperance which fulfils the
    conditions of perfect virtue is not without prudence, while this is lacking
    to all who are in sin. Hence those who lack other virtues, through being
    subject to the opposite vices, have not the temperance which is a virtue,
    though they do acts of temperance from a certain natural disposition, in so
    far as certain imperfect virtues are either natural to man, as stated above
    (FS, Question [63], Article [1]), or acquired by habituation, which virtues,
    through lack of prudence, are not perfected by reason, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Temperance also has a corresponding
    gift, namely, fear, whereby man is withheld from the pleasures of the flesh,
    according to Ps. 118:120: "Pierce Thou my flesh with Thy fear." The gift of
    fear has for its principal object God, Whom it avoids offending, and in this
    respect it corresponds to the virtue of hope, as stated above (<a
      href="SS019.html#SSQ19OUTP1"
      >Question [19]</a
    >, <a href="SS019.html#SSQ19A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>, ad 1). But it may have
    for its secondary object whatever a man shuns in order to avoid offending
    God. Now man stands in the greatest need of the fear of God in order to shun
    those things which are most seductive, and these are the matter of
    temperance: wherefore the gift of fear corresponds to temperance also.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether temperance is a special virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that temperance is not a special
    virtue. For Augustine says (De Morib. Eccl. xv) that "it belongs to
    temperance to preserve one's integrity and freedom from corruption for God's
    sake." But this is common to every virtue. Therefore temperance is not a
    special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 42) that
    "what we observe and seek most in temperance is tranquillity of soul." But
    this is common to every virtue. Therefore temperance is not a special
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Tully says (De Offic. i, 27) that "we
    cannot separate the beautiful from the virtuous," and that "whatever is just
    is beautiful." Now the beautiful is considered as proper to temperance,
    according to the same authority (Tully, De Offic. i, 27). Therefore
    temperance is not a special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 7; iii, 10)
    reckons it a special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is customary in human speech to employ a
    common term in a restricted sense in order to designate the principal things
    to which that common term is applicable: thus the word "city" is used
    antonomastically* to designate Rome. [*Antonomasia is the figure of speech
    whereby we substitute the general for the individual term; e.g. The
    Philosopher for Aristotle]. Accordingly the word "temperance" has a twofold
    acceptation. First, in accordance with its common signification: and thus
    temperance is not a special but a general virtue, because the word
    "temperance" signifies a certain temperateness or moderation, which reason
    appoints to human operations and passions: and this is common to every moral
    virtue. Yet there is a logical difference between temperance and fortitude,
    even if we take them both as general virtues: since temperance withdraws man
    from things which seduce the appetite from obeying reason, while fortitude
    incites him to endure or withstand those things on account of which he
    forsakes the good of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, if we take temperance antonomastically, as withholding
    the appetite from those things which are most seductive to man, it is a
    special virtue, for thus it has, like fortitude, a special matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Man's appetite is corrupted chiefly by
    those things which seduce him into forsaking the rule of reason and Divine
    law. Wherefore integrity, which Augustine ascribes to temperance, can, like
    the latter, be taken in two ways: first, in a general sense, and secondly in
    a sense of excellence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The things about which temperance is
    concerned have a most disturbing effect on the soul, for the reason that
    they are natural to man, as we shall state further on (<a
      href="SS141.html#SSQ141ATHEP1"
      >Articles [4]</a
    >,5). Hence tranquillity of soul is ascribed to temperance by way of
    excellence, although it is a common property of all the virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although beauty is becoming to every
    virtue, it is ascribed to temperance, by way of excellence, for two reasons.
    First, in respect of the generic notion of temperance, which consists in a
    certain moderate and fitting proportion, and this is what we understand by
    beauty, as attested by Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv). Secondly, because the
    things from which temperance withholds us, hold the lowest place in man, and
    are becoming to him by reason of his animal nature, as we shall state
    further on (<a href="SS141.html#SSQ141ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5;
    <a href="SS142.html#SSQ142OUTP1">Question [142]</a>,
    <a href="SS142.html#SSQ142A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), wherefore it is natural
    that such things should defile him. In consequence beauty is a foremost
    attribute of temperance which above all hinders man from being defiled. In
    like manner honesty [*Honesty must be taken here in its broad sense as
    synonymous with moral goodness, from the point of view of decorum] is a
    special attribute of temperance: for Isidore says (Etym. x): "An honest man
    is one who has no defilement, for honesty means an honorable state." This is
    most applicable to temperance, which withstands the vices that bring most
    dishonor on man, as we shall state further on (<a
      href="SS142.html#SSQ142OUTP1"

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether temperance is only about desires and pleasures?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that temperance is not only about
    desires and pleasures. For Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) that
    "temperance is reason's firm and moderate mastery of lust and other wanton
    emotions of the mind." Now all the passions of the soul are called emotions
    of the mind. Therefore it seems that temperance is not only about desires
    and pleasures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "Virtue is about the difficult and the
    good" [*Ethic. ii, 3]. Now it seems more difficult to temper fear,
    especially with regard to dangers of death, than to moderate desires and
    pleasures, which are despised on account of deadly pains and dangers,
    according to Augustine (<a href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [83]</a>,
    qu. 36). Therefore it seems that the virtue of temperance is not chiefly
    about desires and pleasures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Ambrose (De Offic. i, 43)
    "the grace of moderation belongs to temperance": and Tully says (De Offic.
    ii, 27) that "it is the concern of temperance to calm all disturbances of
    the mind and to enforce moderation." Now moderation is needed, not only in
    desires and pleasures, but also in external acts and whatever pertains to
    the exterior. Therefore temperance is not only about desires and
    pleasures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says (Etym.) [*The words quoted do
    not occur in the work referred to; Cf. his De Summo Bono xxxvii, xlii, and
    De Different. ii, 39]: that "it is temperance whereby lust and desire are
    kept under control."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1"
      >Question [123]</a
    >, <a href="SS123.html#SSQ123A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>;
    <a href="SS136.html#SSQ136OUTP1">Question [136]</a>,
    <a href="SS136.html#SSQ136A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it belongs to moral
    virtue to safeguard the good of reason against the passions that rebel
    against reason. Now the movement of the soul's passions is twofold, as
    stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), when we were
    treating of the passions: the one, whereby the sensitive appetite pursues
    sensible and bodily goods, the other whereby it flies from sensible and
    bodily evils.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first of these movements of the sensitive appetite rebels against reason
    chiefly by lack of moderation. Because sensible and bodily goods, considered
    in their species, are not in opposition to reason, but are subject to it as
    instruments which reason employs in order to attain its proper end: and that
    they are opposed to reason is owing to the fact that the sensitive appetite
    fails to tend towards them in accord with the mode of reason. Hence it
    belongs properly to moral virtue to moderate those passions which denote a
    pursuit of the good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, the movement of the sensitive appetite in flying from
    sensible evil is mostly in opposition to reason, not through being
    immoderate, but chiefly in respect of its flight: because, when a man flies
    from sensible and bodily evils, which sometimes accompany the good of
    reason, the result is that he flies from the good of reason. Hence it
    belongs to moral virtue to make man while flying from evil to remain firm in
    the good of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, just as the virtue of fortitude, which by its very nature
    bestows firmness, is chiefly concerned with the passion, viz. fear, which
    regards flight from bodily evils, and consequently with daring, which
    attacks the objects of fear in the hope of attaining some good, so, too,
    temperance, which denotes a kind of moderation, is chiefly concerned with
    those passions that tend towards sensible goods, viz. desire and pleasure,
    and consequently with the sorrows that arise from the absence of those
    pleasures. For just as daring presupposes objects of fear, so too such like
    sorrow arises from the absence of the aforesaid pleasures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS025.html#FSQ25A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), when we were
    treating of the passions, those passions which pertain to avoidance of evil,
    presuppose the passions pertaining to the pursuit of good; and the passions
    of the irascible presuppose the passions of the concupiscible. Hence, while
    temperance directly moderates the passions of the concupiscible which tend
    towards good, as a consequence, it moderates all the other passions,
    inasmuch as moderation of the passions that precede results in moderation of
    the passions that follow: since he that is not immoderate in desire is
    moderate in hope, and grieves moderately for the absence of the things he
    desires.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Desire denotes an impulse of the
    appetite towards the object of pleasure and this impulse needs control,
    which belongs to temperance. on the other hand fear denotes a withdrawal of
    the mind from certain evils, against which man needs firmness of mind, which
    fortitude bestows. Hence temperance is properly about desires, and fortitude
    about fears.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> External acts proceed from the internal
    passions of the soul: wherefore their moderation depends on the moderation
    of the internal passions.<br />

    Whether temperance is only about desires and pleasures of touch?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that temperance is not only about
    desires and pleasures of touch. For Augustine says (De Morib. Eccl. xix)
    that "the function of temperance is to control and quell the desires which
    draw us to the things which withdraw us from the laws of God and from the
    fruit of His goodness"; and a little further on he adds that "it is the duty
    of temperance to spurn all bodily allurements and popular praise." Now we
    are withdrawn from God's laws not only by the desire for pleasures of touch,
    but also by the desire for pleasures of the other senses, for these, too,
    belong to the bodily allurements, and again by the desire for riches or for
    worldly glory: wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++6%3A10"
      >1 Tim. 6:10</a
    >). "Desire [*'Cupiditas,' which is the Douay version following the Greek
    {philargyria} renders 'desire of money'] is the root of all evils."
    Therefore temperance is not only about desires of pleasures of touch.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 3) that
    "one who is worthy of small things and deems himself worthy of them is
    temperate, but he is not magnificent." Now honors, whether small or great,
    of which he is speaking there, are an object of pleasure, not of touch, but
    in the soul's apprehension. Therefore temperance is not only about desires
    for pleasures of touch.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things that are of the same genus would
    seem to pertain to the matter of a particular virtue under one same aspect.
    Now all pleasures of sense are apparently of the same genus. Therefore they
    all equally belong to the matter of temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, spiritual pleasures are greater than the
    pleasures of the body, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS031.html#FSQ31OUTP1">Question [31]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS031.html#FSQ31A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>) in the treatise on
    the passions. Now sometimes men forsake God's laws and the state of virtue
    through desire for spiritual pleasures, for instance, through curiosity in
    matters of knowledge: wherefore the devil promised man knowledge, saying (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++3%3A5"
      >Gn. 3:5</a
    >): "Ye shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil." Therefore temperance is
    not only about pleasures of touch.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, if pleasures of touch were the proper
    matter of temperance, it would follow that temperance is about all pleasures
    of touch. But it is not about all, for instance, about those which occur in
    games. Therefore pleasures of touch are not the proper matter of
    temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 10) that
    "temperance is properly about desires of pleasures of touch."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS141.html#SSQ141A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), temperance is about desires and pleasures in the same way as fortitude
    is about fear and daring. Now fortitude is about fear and daring with
    respect to the greatest evils whereby nature itself is dissolved; and such
    are dangers of death. Wherefore in like manner temperance must needs be
    about desires for the greatest pleasures. And since pleasure results from a
    natural operation, it is so much the greater according as it results from a
    more natural operation. Now to animals the most natural operations are those
    which preserve the nature of the individual by means of meat and drink, and
    the nature of the species by the union of the sexes. Hence temperance is
    properly about pleasures of meat and drink and sexual pleasures. Now these
    pleasures result from the sense of touch. Wherefore it follows that
    temperance is about pleasures of touch.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the passage quoted Augustine
    apparently takes temperance, not as a special virtue having a determinate
    matter, but as concerned with the moderation of reason, in any matter
    whatever: and this is a general condition of every virtue. However, we may
    also reply that if a man can control the greatest pleasures, much more can
    he control lesser ones. Wherefore it belongs chiefly and properly to
    temperance to moderate desires and pleasures of touch, and secondarily other
    pleasures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Philosopher takes temperance as
    denoting moderation in external things, when, to wit, a man tends to that
    which is proportionate to him, but not as denoting moderation in the soul's
    emotions, which pertains to the virtue of temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The pleasures of the other senses play a
    different part in man and in other animals. For in other animals pleasures
    do not result from the other senses save in relation to sensibles of touch:
    thus the lion is pleased to see the stag, or to hear its voice, in relation
    to his food. On the other hand man derives pleasure from the other senses,
    not only for this reason, but also on account of the becomingness of the
    sensible object. Wherefore temperance is about the pleasures of the other
    senses, in relation to pleasures of touch, not principally but consequently:
    while in so far as the sensible objects of the other senses are pleasant on
    account of their becomingness, as when a man is pleased at a well-harmonized
    sound, this pleasure has nothing to do with the preservation of nature.
    Hence these passions are not of such importance that temperance can be
    referred to them antonomastically.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although spiritual pleasures are by
    their nature greater than bodily pleasures, they are not so perceptible to
    the senses, and consequently they do not so strongly affect the sensitive
    appetite, against whose impulse the good of reason is safeguarded by moral
    virtue. We may also reply that spiritual pleasures, strictly speaking, are
    in accordance with reason, wherefore they need no control, save
    accidentally, in so far as one spiritual pleasure is a hindrance to another
    greater and more binding.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Not all pleasures of touch regard the
    preservation of nature, and consequently it does not follow that temperance
    is about all pleasures of touch.

    Whether temperance is about the pleasures proper to the taste?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that temperance is about pleasures
    proper to the taste. For pleasures of the taste result from food and drink,
    which are more necessary to man's life than sexual pleasures, which regard
    the touch. But according to what has been said (<a
      href="SS141.html#SSQ141A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >), temperance is about pleasures in things that are necessary to human
    life. Therefore temperance is about pleasures proper to the taste rather
    than about those proper to the touch.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, temperance is about the passions rather
    than about things themselves. Now, according to De Anima ii, 3, "the touch
    is the sense of food," as regards the very substance of the food, whereas
    "savor" which is the proper object of the taste, is "the pleasing quality of
    the food." Therefore temperance is about the taste rather than about the
    touch.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Ethic. vii, 4,7:
    "temperance and intemperance are about the same things, and so are
    continence and incontinence, perseverance, and effeminacy," to which
    delicacy pertains. Now delicacy seems to regard the delight taken in savors
    which are the object of the taste. Therefore temperance is about pleasures
    proper to the taste.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 10) that
    "seemingly temperance and intemperance have little if anything to do with
    the taste."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS141.html#SSQ141A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >), temperance is about the greatest pleasures, which chiefly regard the
    preservation of human life either in the species or in the individual. In
    these matters certain things are to be considered as principal and others as
    secondary. The principal thing is the use itself of the necessary means, of
    the woman who is necessary for the preservation of the species, or of food
    and drink which are necessary for the preservation of the individual: while
    the very use of these necessary things has a certain essential pleasure
    annexed thereto.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In regard to either use we consider as secondary whatever makes the use more
    pleasurable, such as beauty and adornment in woman, and a pleasing savor and
    likewise odor in food. Hence temperance is chiefly about the pleasure of
    touch, that results essentially from the use of these necessary things,
    which use is in all cases attained by the touch. Secondarily, however,
    temperance and intemperance are about pleasures of the taste, smell, or
    sight, inasmuch as the sensible objects of these senses conduce to the
    pleasurable use of the necessary things that have relation to the touch. But
    since the taste is more akin to the touch than the other senses are, it
    follows that temperance is more about the taste than about the other
    senses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The use of food and the pleasure that
    essentially results therefrom pertain to the touch. Hence the Philosopher
    says (De Anima ii, 3) that "touch is the sense of food, for food is hot or
    cold, wet or dry." To the taste belongs the discernment of savors, which
    make the food pleasant to eat, in so far as they are signs of its being
    suitable for nourishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The pleasure resulting from savor is
    additional, so to speak, whereas the pleasure of touch results essentially
    from the use of food and drink.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Delicacy regards principally the
    substance of the food, but secondarily it regards its delicious savor and
    the way in which it is served.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the rule of temperance depends on the need of the present life?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the rule of temperance does
    not depend on the needs of the present life. For higher things are not
    regulated according to lower. Now, as temperance is a virtue of the soul, it
    is above the needs of the body. Therefore the rule of temperance does not
    depend on the needs of the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever exceeds a rule sins. Therefore
    if the needs of the body were the rule of temperance, it would be a sin
    against temperance to indulge in any other pleasure than those required by
    nature, which is content with very little. But this would seem
    unreasonable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one sins in observing a rule.
    Therefore if the need of the body were the rule of temperance, there would
    be no sin in using any pleasure for the needs of the body, for instance, for
    the sake of health. But this is apparently false. Therefore the need of the
    body is not the rule of temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Morib. Eccl. xxi): "In
    both Testaments the temperate man finds confirmation of the rule forbidding
    him to love the things of this life, or to deem any of them desirable for
    its own sake, and commanding him to avail himself of those things with the
    moderation of a user not the attachment of a lover, in so far as they are
    requisite for the needs of this life and of his station."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS141.html#SSQ141A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >; <a href="SS109.html#SSQ109OUTP1">Question [109]</a>,
    <a href="SS109.html#SSQ109A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>,
    <a href="SS123.html#SSQ123A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>), the good of moral
    virtue consists chiefly in the order of reason: because "man's good is to be
    in accord with reason," as Dionysius asserts (Div. Nom. iv). Now the
    principal order of reason is that by which it directs certain things towards
    their end, and the good of reason consists chiefly in this order; since good
    has the aspect of end, and the end is the rule of whatever is directed to
    the end. Now all the pleasurable objects that are at man's disposal, are
    directed to some necessity of this life as to their end. Wherefore
    temperance takes the need of this life, as the rule of the pleasurable
    objects of which it makes use, and uses them only for as much as the need of
    this life requires.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above, the need of this life
    is regarded as a rule in so far as it is an end. Now it must be observed
    that sometimes the end of the worker differs from the end of the work, thus
    it is clear that the end of building is a house, whereas sometimes the end
    of the builder is profit. Accordingly the end and rule of temperance itself
    is happiness; while the end and rule of the thing it makes use of is the
    need of human life, to which whatever is useful for life is subordinate.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The need of human life may be taken in
    two ways. First, it may be taken in the sense in which we apply the term
    "necessary" to that without which a thing cannot be at all; thus food is
    necessary to an animal. Secondly, it may be taken for something without
    which a thing cannot be becomingly. Now temperance regards not only the
    former of these needs, but also the latter. Wherefore the Philosopher says
    (Ethic. iii, 11) that "the temperate man desires pleasant things for the
    sake of health, or for the sake of a sound condition of body." Other things
    that are not necessary for this purpose may be divided into two classes. For
    some are a hindrance to health and a sound condition of body; and these
    temperance makes not use of whatever, for this would be a sin against
    temperance. But others are not a hindrance to those things, and these
    temperance uses moderately, according to the demands of place and time, and
    in keeping with those among whom one dwells. Hence the Philosopher (Ethic.
    iii, 11) says that the "temperate man also desires other pleasant things,"
    those namely that are not necessary for health or a sound condition of body,
    "so long as they are not prejudicial to these things."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated (ad 2), temperance regards
    need according to the requirements of life, and this depends not only on the
    requirements of the body, but also on the requirements of external things,
    such as riches and station, and more still on the requirements of good
    conduct. Hence the Philosopher adds (Ethic. iii, 11) that "the temperate man
    makes use of pleasant things provided that not only they be not prejudicial
    to health and a sound bodily condition, but also that they be not
    inconsistent with good," i.e. good conduct, nor "beyond his substance," i.e.
    his means. And Augustine says (De Morib. Eccl. xxi) that the "temperate man
    considers the need" not only "of this life" but also "of his station."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether temperance is a cardinal virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that temperance is not a cardinal
    virtue. For the good of moral virtue depends on reason. But temperance is
    about those things that are furthest removed from reason, namely about
    pleasures common to us and the lower animals, as stated in Ethic. iii, 10.
    Therefore temperance, seemingly, is not a principal virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the greater the impetus the more
    difficult is it to control. Now anger, which is controlled by meekness,
    seems to be more impetuous than desire, which is controlled by temperance.
    For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++27%3A4"
      >Prov. 27:4</a
    >): "Anger hath no mercy, nor fury when it breaketh forth; and who can bear
    the violence [impetum] of one provoked?" Therefore meekness is a principal
    virtue rather than temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, hope as a movement of the soul takes
    precedence of desire and concupiscence, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS025.html#FSQ25A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But humility
    controls the presumption of immoderate hope. Therefore, seemingly, humility
    is a principal virtue rather than temperance which controls
    concupiscence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory reckons temperance among the
    principal virtues (Moral. ii, 49).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1"
      >Question [123]</a
    >, <a href="SS123.html#SSQ123A11THEP1">Article [11]</a>;
    <a href="SS061.html#SSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>,
    <a href="SS061.html#SSQ61A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), a principal or cardinal
    virtue is so called because it has a foremost claim to praise on account of
    one of those things that are requisite for the notion of virtue in general.
    Now moderation, which is requisite in every virtue, deserves praise
    principally in pleasures of touch, with which temperance is concerned, both
    because these pleasures are most natural to us, so that it is more difficult
    to abstain from them, and to control the desire for them, and because their
    objects are more necessary to the present life, as stated above (<a
      href="SS141.html#SSQ141A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >). For this reason temperance is reckoned a principal or cardinal
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The longer the range of its operation,
    the greater is the agent's power [virtus] shown to be: wherefore the very
    fact that the reason is able to moderate desires and pleasures that are
    furthest removed from it, proves the greatness of reason's power. This is
    how temperance comes to be a principal virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The impetuousness of anger is caused by
    an accident, for instance, a painful hurt; wherefore it soon passes,
    although its impetus be great. On the other hand, the impetuousness of the
    desire for pleasures of touch proceeds from a natural cause, wherefore it is
    more lasting and more general, and consequently its control regards a more
    principal virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The object of hope is higher than the
    object of desire, wherefore hope is accounted the principal passion in the
    irascible. But the objects of desires and pleasures of touch move the
    appetite with greater force, since they are more natural. Therefore
    temperance, which appoints the mean in such things, is a principal
    virtue.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether temperance is the greatest of the virtues?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that temperance is the greatest of
    the virtues. For Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 43) that "what we observe and
    seek most in temperance is the safeguarding of what is honorable, and the
    regard for what is beautiful." Now virtue deserves praise for being
    honorable and beautiful. Therefore temperance is the greatest of the
    virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the more difficult the deed the greater
    the virtue. Now it is more difficult to control desires and pleasures of
    touch than to regulate external actions, the former pertaining to temperance
    and the latter to justice. Therefore temperance is a greater virtue than
    justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, seemingly the more general a thing is,
    the more necessary and the better it is. Now fortitude is about dangers of
    death which occur less frequently than pleasures of touch, for these occur
    every day; so that temperance is in more general use than fortitude.
    Therefore temperance is a more excellent virtue than fortitude.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Rhet. i, 9) that the
    "greatest virtues are those which are most profitable to others, for which
    reason we give the greatest honor to the brave and the just."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the Philosopher declares (Ethic. i, 2) "the
    good of the many is more of the godlike than the good of the individual,"
    wherefore the more a virtue regards the good of the many, the better it is.
    Now justice and fortitude regard the good of the many more than temperance
    does, since justice regards the relations between one man and another, while
    fortitude regards dangers of battle which are endured for the common weal:
    whereas temperance moderates only the desires and pleasures which affect man
    himself. Hence it is evident that justice and fortitude are more excellent
    virtues than temperance: while prudence and the theological virtues are more
    excellent still.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Honor and beauty are especially ascribed
    to temperance, not on account of the excellence of the good proper to
    temperance, but on account of the disgrace of the contrary evil from which
    it withdraws us, by moderating the pleasures common to us and the lower
    animals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since virtue is about the difficult and
    the good, the excellence of a virtue is considered more under the aspect of
    good, wherein justice excels, than under the aspect of difficult, wherein
    temperance excels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That which is general because it regards
    the many conduces more to the excellence of goodness than that which is
    general because it occurs frequently: fortitude excels in the former way,
    temperance in the latter. Hence fortitude is greater simply, although in
    some respects temperance may be described as greater not only than fortitude
    but also than justice.<br />
