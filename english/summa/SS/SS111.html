  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether all dissimulation is a sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that not all dissimulation is a sin. For
    it is written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++24%3A28"
      >Lk. 24:28</a
    >) that our Lord "pretended [Douay: 'made as though'] he would go farther";
    and Ambrose in his book on the Patriarchs (De Abraham i) says of Abraham
    that he "spoke craftily to his servants, when he said" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++22%3A5"
      >Gn. 22:5</a
    >): "I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and after we have
    worshipped, will return to you." Now to pretend and to speak craftily savor
    of dissimulation: and yet it is not to be said that there was sin in Christ
    or Abraham. Therefore not all dissimulation is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no sin is profitable. But according to
    Jerome, in his commentary on Gal. 2:11, "When Peter [Vulg.: 'Cephas'] was
    come to Antioch:---The example of Jehu, king of Israel, who slew the priest
    of Baal, pretending that he desired to worship idols, should teach us that
    dissimulation is useful and sometimes to be employed"; and David "changed
    his countenance before" Achis, king of Geth (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Sam++21%3A13"
      >1 Kgs. 21:13</a
    >). Therefore not all dissimulation is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, good is contrary to evil. Therefore if
    it is evil to simulate good, it is good to simulate evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is written in condemnation of certain
    people (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++3%3A9">Is. 3:9</a
    >): "They have proclaimed abroad their sin as Sodom, and they have not hid
    it." Now it pertains to dissimulation to hide one's sin. Therefore it is
    reprehensible sometimes not to simulate. But it is never reprehensible to
    avoid sin. Therefore dissimulation is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Is. 16:14, "In three years," etc.,
    says: "Of the two evils it is less to sin openly than to simulate holiness."
    But to sin openly is always a sin. Therefore dissimulation is always a
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS109.html#SSQ109OUTP1"
      >Question [109]</a
    >, <a href="SS109.html#SSQ109A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="SS110.html#SSQ110OUTP1">Question [110]</a>,
    <a href="SS110.html#SSQ110A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it belongs to the
    virtue of truth to show oneself outwardly by outward signs to be such as one
    is. Now outward signs are not only words, but also deeds. Accordingly just
    as it is contrary to truth to signify by words something different from that
    which is in one's mind, so also is it contrary to truth to employ signs of
    deeds or things to signify the contrary of what is in oneself, and this is
    what is properly denoted by dissimulation. Consequently dissimulation is
    properly a lie told by the signs of outward deeds. Now it matters not
    whether one lie in word or in any other way, as stated above (<a
      href="SS110.html#SSQ110OUTP1"
      >Question [110]</a
    >, <a href="SS110.html#SSQ110A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, Objection [2]).
    Wherefore, since every lie is a sin, as stated above (<a
      href="SS110.html#SSQ110OUTP1"
      >Question [110]</a
    >, <a href="SS110.html#SSQ110A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), it follows that also
    all dissimulation is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Questions. Evang.
    ii), "To pretend is not always a lie: but only when the pretense has no
    signification, then it is a lie. When, however, our pretense refers to some
    signification, there is no lie, but a representation of the truth." And he
    cites figures of speech as an example, where a thing is "pretended," for we
    do not mean it to be taken literally but as a figure of something else that
    we wish to say. In this way our Lord "pretended He would go farther,"
    because He acted as if wishing to go farther; in order to signify something
    figuratively either because He was far from their faith, according to
    Gregory (Hom. xxiii in Ev.); or, as Augustine says (De Questions. Evang.
    ii), because, "as He was about to go farther away from them by ascending
    into heaven, He was, so to speak, held back on earth by their
    hospitality."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Abraham also spoke figuratively. Wherefore Ambrose (De Abraham i) says that
    Abraham "foretold what he knew not": for he intended to return alone after
    sacrificing his son: but by his mouth the Lord expressed what He was about
    to do. It is evident therefore that neither dissembled.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Jerome employs the term "simulation" in
    a broad sense for any kind of pretense. David's change of countenance was a
    figurative pretense, as a gloss observes in commenting on the title of Ps.
    33, "I will bless the Lord at all times." There is no need to excuse Jehu's
    dissimulation from sin or lie, because he was a wicked man, since he
    departed not from the idolatry of Jeroboam (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Kgs++10%3A29,31"
      >4 Kgs. 10:29,31</a
    >). And yet he is praised withal and received an earthly reward from God,
    not for his dissimulation, but for his zeal in destroying the worship of
    Baal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Some say that no one may pretend to be
    wicked, because no one pretends to be wicked by doing good deeds, and if he
    do evil deeds, he is evil. But this argument proves nothing. Because a man
    might pretend to be evil, by doing what is not evil in itself but has some
    appearance of evil: and nevertheless this dissimulation is evil, both
    because it is a lie, and because it gives scandal; and although he is wicked
    on this account, yet his wickedness is not the wickedness he simulates. And
    because dissimulation is evil in itself, its sinfulness is not derived from
    the thing simulated, whether this be good or evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Just as a man lies when he signifies by
    word that which he is not, yet lies not when he refrains from saying what he
    is, for this is sometimes lawful; so also does a man dissemble, when by
    outward signs of deeds or things he signifies that which he is not, yet he
    dissembles not if he omits to signify what he is. Hence one may hide one's
    sin without being guilty of dissimulation. It is thus that we must
    understand the saying of Jerome on the words of Isaias 3:9, that the "second
    remedy after shipwreck is to hide one's sin," lest, to wit, others be
    scandalized thereby.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether hypocrisy is the same as dissimulation?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that hypocrisy is not the same as
    dissimulation. For dissimulation consists in lying by deeds. But there may
    be hypocrisy in showing outwardly what one does inwardly, according to Mt.
    6:2, "When thou dost an alms-deed sound not a trumpet before thee, as the
    hypocrites do." Therefore hypocrisy is not the same as dissimulation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. xxxi, 7): "Some
    there are who wear the habit of holiness, yet are unable to attain the merit
    of perfection. We must by no means deem these to have joined the ranks of
    the hypocrites, since it is one thing to sin from weakness, and another to
    sin from malice." Now those who wear the habit of holiness, without
    attaining the merit of perfection, are dissemblers, since the outward habit
    signifies works of perfection. Therefore dissimulation is not the same as
    hypocrisy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, hypocrisy consists in the mere
    intention. For our Lord says of hypocrites (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++23%3A5"
      >Mt. 23:5</a
    >) that "all their works they do for to be seen of men": and Gregory says
    (Moral. xxxi, 7) that "they never consider what it is that they do, but how
    by their every action they may please men." But dissimulation consists, not
    in the mere intention, but in the outward action: wherefore a gloss on Job
    36:13, "Dissemblers and crafty men prove the wrath of God," says that "the
    dissembler simulates one thing and does another: he pretends chastity, and
    delights in lewdness, he makes a show of poverty and fills his purse."
    Therefore hypocrisy is not the same as dissimulation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says (Etym. x): "'Hypocrite' is a
    Greek word corresponding to the Latin 'simulator,' for whereas he is evil
    within," he "shows himself outwardly as being good; {hypo} denoting
    falsehood, and {krisis}, judgment."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Isidore says (Etym. x), "the word hypocrite
    is derived from the appearance of those who come on to the stage with a
    disguised face, by changing the color of their complexion, so as to imitate
    the complexion of the person they simulate, at one time under the guise of a
    man, at another under the guise of a woman, so as to deceive the people in
    their acting." Hence Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. ii) that "just as
    hypocrites by simulating other persons act the parts of those they are not
    (since he that acts the part of Agamemnon is not that man himself but
    pretends to be), so too in the Church and in every department of human life,
    whoever wishes to seem what he is not is a hypocrite: for he pretends to be
    just without being so in reality."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must conclude, therefore, that hypocrisy is dissimulation, not, however,
    any form of dissimulation, but only when one person simulates another, as
    when a sinner simulates the person of a just man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The outward deed is a natural sign of
    the intention. Accordingly when a man does good works pertaining by their
    genus to the service of God, and seeks by their means to please, not God but
    man, he simulates a right intention which he has not. Wherefore Gregory says
    (Moral.) that "hypocrites make God's interests subservient to worldly
    purposes, since by making a show of saintly conduct they seek, not to turn
    men to God, but to draw to themselves the applause of their approval:" and
    so they make a lying pretense of having a good intention, which they have
    not, although they do not pretend to do a good deed without doing it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The habit of holiness, for instance the
    religious or the clerical habit, signifies a state whereby one is bound to
    perform works of perfection. And so when a man puts on the habit of
    holiness, with the intention of entering the state of perfection, if he fail
    through weakness, he is not a dissembler or a hypocrite, because he is not
    bound to disclose his sin by laying aside the habit of holiness. If,
    however, he were to put on the habit of holiness in order to make a show of
    righteousness, he would be a hypocrite and a dissembler.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In dissimulation, as in a lie, there are
    two things: one by way of sign, the other by way of thing signified.
    Accordingly the evil intention in hypocrisy is considered as a thing
    signified, which does not tally with the sign: and the outward words, or
    deeds, or any sensible objects are considered in every dissimulation and lie
    as a sign.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether hypocrisy is contrary to the virtue of truth?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that hypocrisy is not contrary to the
    virtue of truth. For in dissimulation or hypocrisy there is a sign and a
    thing signified. Now with regard to neither of these does it seem to be
    opposed to any special virtue: for a hypocrite simulates any virtue, and by
    means of any virtuous deeds, such as fasting, prayer and alms deeds, as
    stated in Mt. 6:1-18. Therefore hypocrisy is not specially opposed to the
    virtue of truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, all dissimulation seems to proceed from
    guile, wherefore it is opposed to simplicity. Now guile is opposed to
    prudence as above stated (<a href="SS055.html#SSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>,
    <a href="SS055.html#SSQ55A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore, hypocrisy
    which is dissimulation is not opposed to truth, but rather to prudence or
    simplicity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the species of moral acts is taken from
    their end. Now the end of hypocrisy is the acquisition of gain or vainglory:
    wherefore a gloss on Job 27:8, "What is the hope of the hypocrite, if
    through covetousness he take by violence," says: "A hypocrite or, as the
    Latin has it, a dissimulator, is a covetous thief: for through desire of
    being honored for holiness, though guilty of wickedness, he steals praise
    for a life which is not his." [*The quotation is from St. Gregory's Moralia,
    Bk XVIII.] Therefore since covetousness or vainglory is not directly opposed
    to truth, it seems that neither is hypocrisy or dissimulation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> All dissimulation is a lie, as stated above
    (<a href="SS111.html#SSQ111A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now a lie is directly
    opposed to truth. Therefore dissimulation or hypocrisy is also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Metaph. text. 13,
    24, x), "contrariety is opposition as regards form," i.e. the specific form.
    Accordingly we must reply that dissimulation or hypocrisy may be opposed to
    a virtue in two ways, in one way directly, in another way indirectly. Its
    direct opposition or contrariety is to be considered with regard to the very
    species of the act, and this species depends on that act's proper object.
    Wherefore since hypocrisy is a kind of dissimulation, whereby a man
    simulates a character which is not his, as stated in the preceding article,
    it follows that it is directly opposed to truth whereby a man shows himself
    in life and speech to be what he is, as stated in Ethic. iv, 7.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The indirect opposition or contrariety of hypocrisy may be considered in
    relation to any accident, for instance a remote end, or an instrument of
    action, or anything else of that kind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The hypocrite in simulating a virtue
    regards it as his end, not in respect of its existence, as though he wished
    to have it, but in respect of appearance, since he wishes to seem to have
    it. Hence his hypocrisy is not opposed to that virtue, but to truth,
    inasmuch as he wishes to deceive men with regard to that virtue. And he
    performs acts of that virtue, not as intending them for their own sake, but
    instrumentally, as signs of that virtue, wherefore his hypocrisy has not, on
    that account, a direct opposition to that virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS055.html#SSQ55OUTP1"
      >Question [55]</a
    >, <a href="SS055.html#SSQ55ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4,5), the vice directly
    opposed to prudence is cunning, to which it belongs to discover ways of
    achieving a purpose, that are apparent and not real: while it accomplishes
    that purpose, by guile in words, and by fraud in deeds: and it stands in
    relation to prudence, as guile and fraud to simplicity. Now guile and fraud
    are directed chiefly to deception, and sometimes secondarily to injury.
    Wherefore it belongs directly to simplicity to guard oneself from deception,
    and in this way the virtue of simplicity is the same as the virtue of truth
    as stated above (<a href="SS109.html#SSQ109OUTP1">Question [109]</a>,
    <a href="SS109.html#SSQ109A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 4). There is,
    however, a mere logical difference between them, because by truth we mean
    the concordance between sign and thing signified, while simplicity indicates
    that one does not tend to different things, by intending one thing inwardly,
    and pretending another outwardly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Gain or glory is the remote end of the
    dissembler as also of the liar. Hence it does not take its species from this
    end, but from the proximate end, which is to show oneself other than one is.
    Wherefore it sometimes happens to a man to pretend great things of himself,
    for no further purpose than the mere lust of hypocrisy, as the Philosopher
    says (Ethic. iv, 7), and as also we have said above with regard to lying (<a
      href="SS110.html#SSQ110OUTP1"

  <h3 align="left">Whether hypocrisy is always a mortal sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />

    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that hypocrisy is always a mortal sin.
    For Jerome says on Is. 16:14: "Of the two evils it is less to sin openly
    than to simulate holiness": and a gloss on Job 1:21 [*St. Augustine on Ps.
    63:7], "As it hath pleased the Lord," etc., says that "pretended justice is
    no justice, but a twofold sin": and again a gloss on Lam. 4:6, "The
    iniquity... of my people is made greater than the sin of Sodom," says: "He
    deplores the sins of the soul that falls into hypocrisy, which is a greater
    iniquity than the sin of Sodom." Now the sins of Sodom are mortal sin.
    Therefore hypocrisy is always a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. xxxi, 8) that
    hypocrites sin out of malice. But this is most grievous, for it pertains to
    the sin against the Holy Ghost. Therefore a hypocrite always sins
    mortally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one deserves the anger of God and
    exclusion from seeing God, save on account of mortal sin. Now the anger of
    God is deserved through hypocrisy according to Job 36:13, "Dissemblers and
    crafty men prove the wrath of God": and the hypocrite is excluded from
    seeing God, according to Job 13:16, "No hypocrite shall come before His
    presence." Therefore hypocrisy is always a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Hypocrisy is lying by deed since it is a kind
    of dissimulation. But it is not always a mortal sin to lie by deed. Neither
    therefore is all hypocrisy a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the intention of a hypocrite is to appear to be good. But this is
    not contrary to charity. Therefore hypocrisy is not of itself a mortal
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, hypocrisy is born of vainglory, as Gregory says (Moral. xxxi, 17).
    But vainglory is not always a mortal sin. Neither therefore is hypocrisy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There are two things in hypocrisy, lack of
    holiness, and simulation thereof. Accordingly if by a hypocrite we mean a
    person whose intention is directed to both the above, one, namely, who cares
    not to be holy but only to appear so, in which sense Sacred Scripture is
    wont to use the term, it is evident that hypocrisy is a mortal sin: for no
    one is entirely deprived of holiness save through mortal sin. But if by a
    hypocrite we mean one who intends to simulate holiness, which he lacks
    through mortal sin, then, although he is in mortal sin, whereby he is
    deprived of holiness, yet, in his case, the dissimulation itself is not
    always a mortal sin, but sometimes a venial sin. This will depend on the end
    in view; for if this be contrary to the love of God or of his neighbor, it
    will be a mortal sin: for instance if he were to simulate holiness in order
    to disseminate false doctrine, or that he may obtain ecclesiastical
    preferment, though unworthy, or that he may obtain any temporal good in
    which he fixes his end. If, however, the end intended be not contrary to
    charity, it will be a venial sin, as for instance when a man takes pleasure
    in the pretense itself: of such a man it is said in Ethic. iv, 7 that "he
    would seem to be vain rather than evil"; for the same applies to simulation
    as to a lie.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It happens also sometimes that a man simulates the perfection of holiness
    which is not necessary for spiritual welfare. Simulation of this kind is
    neither a mortal sin always, nor is it always associated with mortal sin.
