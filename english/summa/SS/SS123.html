    FORTITUDE (Questions [123]-124)<br />
    <br />
    OF FORTITUDE (TWELVE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    After considering justice we must in due sequence consider fortitude. We
    must (1) consider the virtue itself of fortitude; (2) its parts; (3) the
    gift corresponding thereto; (4) the precepts that pertain to it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Concerning fortitude three things have to be considered: (1) Fortitude
    itself; (2) its principal act, viz. martyrdom; (3) the vices opposed to
    fortitude.
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are twelve points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS123.html#SSQ123A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether fortitude is a virtue?
  </p>

    matters?

    act?
  </p>

    its own good?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS123.html#SSQ123A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether it takes pleasure in its
    own action?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS123.html#SSQ123A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether fortitude deals chiefly
    with sudden occurrences?
  </p>
  <p>

    in its action?

    virtue?

  <h3 align="left">Whether fortitude is a virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that fortitude is not a virtue. For the
    Apostle says (2 Cor. 12:9): "Virtue is perfected in infirmity." But
    fortitude is contrary to infirmity. Therefore fortitude is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if it is a virtue, it is either
    theological, intellectual, or moral. Now fortitude is not contained among
    the theological virtues, nor among the intellectual virtues, as may be
    gathered from what we have said above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS057.html#FSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS057.html#FSQ57A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Neither,
    apparently, is it contained among the moral virtues, since according to the
    Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 7,8): "Some seem to be brave through ignorance; or
    through experience, as soldiers," both of which cases seem to pertain to act
    rather than to moral virtue, "and some are called brave on account of
    certain passions"; for instance, on account of fear of threats, or of
    dishonor, or again on account of sorrow, anger, or hope. But moral virtue
    does not act from passion but from choice, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore
    fortitude is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, human virtue resides chiefly in the
    soul, since it is a "good quality of the mind," as stated above (Ethic. iii,
    7,8). But fortitude, seemingly, resides in the body, or at least results
    from the temperament of the body. Therefore it seems that fortitude is not a
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (De Morib. Eccl. xv, xxi, xxii)
    numbers fortitude among the virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 6)
    "virtue is that which makes its possessor good, and renders his work good."
    Hence human virtue, of which we are speaking now, is that which makes a man
    good, and tenders his work good. Now man's good is to be in accordance with
    reason, according to Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv, 22). Wherefore it belongs to
    human virtue to make man good, to make his work accord with reason. This
    happens in three ways: first, by rectifying reason itself, and this is done
    by the intellectual virtues; secondly, by establishing the rectitude of
    reason in human affairs, and this belongs to justice; thirdly, by removing
    the obstacles to the establishment of this rectitude in human affairs. Now
    the human will is hindered in two ways from following the rectitude of
    reason. First, through being drawn by some object of pleasure to something
    other than what the rectitude of reason requires; and this obstacle is
    removed by the virtue of temperance. Secondly, through the will being
    disinclined to follow that which is in accordance with reason, on account of
    some difficulty that presents itself. In order to remove this obstacle
    fortitude of the mind is requisite, whereby to resist the aforesaid
    difficulty even as a man, by fortitude of body, overcomes and removes bodily
    obstacles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence it is evident that fortitude is a virtue, in so far as it conforms man
    to reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The virtue of the soul is perfected, not
    in the infirmity of the soul, but in the infirmity of the body, of which the
    Apostle was speaking. Now it belongs to fortitude of the mind to bear
    bravely with infirmities of the flesh, and this belongs to the virtue of
    patience or fortitude, as also to acknowledge one's own infirmity, and this
    belongs to the perfection that is called humility.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sometimes a person performs the exterior
    act of a virtue without having the virtue, and from some other cause than
    virtue. Hence the Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 8) mentions five ways in which
    people are said to be brave by way of resemblance, through performing acts
    of fortitude without having the virtue. This may be done in three ways.
    First, because they tend to that which is difficult as though it were not
    difficult: and this again happens in three ways, for sometimes this is owing
    to ignorance, through not perceiving the greatness of the danger; sometimes
    it is owing to the fact that one is hopeful of overcoming dangers---when,
    for instance, one has often experienced escape from danger; and sometimes
    this is owing to a certain science and art, as in the case of soldiers who,
    through skill and practice in the use of arms, think little of the dangers
    of battle, as they reckon themselves capable of defending themselves against
    them; thus Vegetius says (De Re Milit. i), "No man fears to do what he is
    confident of having learned to do well." Secondly, a man performs an act of
    fortitude without having the virtue, through the impulse of a passion,
    whether of sorrow that he wishes to cast off, or again of anger. Thirdly,
    through choice, not indeed of a due end, but of some temporal advantage to
    be obtained, such as honor, pleasure, or gain, or of some disadvantage to be
    avoided, such as blame, pain, or loss.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The fortitude of the soul which is
    reckoned a virtue, as explained in the Reply to the First Objection, is so
    called from its likeness to fortitude of the body. Nor is it inconsistent
    with the notion of virtue, that a man should have a natural inclination to
    virtue by reason of his natural temperament, as stated above (<a

  <h3 align="left">Whether fortitude is a special virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that fortitude is not a special virtue.
    For it is written (Wis. 7:7): "She teacheth temperance, and prudence, and
    justice, and fortitude," where the text has "virtue" for "fortitude." Since
    then the term "virtue" is common to all virtues, it seems that fortitude is
    a general virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Ambrose says (De Offic. i): "Fortitude
    is not lacking in courage, for alone she defends the honor of the virtues
    and guards their behests. She it is that wages an inexorable war on all
    vice, undeterred by toil, brave in face of dangers, steeled against
    pleasures, unyielding to lusts, avoiding covetousness as a deformity that
    weakens virtue"; and he says the same further on in connection with other
    vices. Now this cannot apply to any special virtue. Therefore fortitude is
    not a special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fortitude would seem to derive its name
    from firmness. But it belongs to every virtue to stand firm, as stated in
    Ethic. ii. Therefore fortitude is a general virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxii) numbers it among the
    other virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), the term
    "fortitude" can be taken in two ways. First, as simply denoting a certain
    firmness of mind, and in this sense it is a general virtue, or rather a
    condition of every virtue, since as the Philosopher states (Ethic. ii), it
    is requisite for every virtue to act firmly and immovably. Secondly,
    fortitude may be taken to denote firmness only in bearing and withstanding
    those things wherein it is most difficult to be firm, namely in certain
    grave dangers. Therefore Tully says (Rhet. ii), that "fortitude is
    deliberate facing of dangers and bearing of toils." In this sense fortitude
    is reckoned a special virtue, because it has a special matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to the Philosopher (De Coelo
    i, 116) the word virtue refers to the extreme limit of a power. Now a
    natural power is, in one sense, the power of resisting corruptions, and in
    another sense is a principle of action, as stated in Metaph. v, 17. And
    since this latter meaning is the more common, the term "virtue," as denoting
    the extreme limit of such a power, is a common term, for virtue taken in a
    general sense is nothing else than a habit whereby one acts well. But as
    denoting the extreme limit of power in the first sense, which sense is more
    specific, it is applied to a special virtue, namely fortitude, to which it
    belongs to stand firm against all kinds of assaults.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Ambrose takes fortitude in a broad
    sense, as denoting firmness of mind in face of assaults of all kinds.
    Nevertheless even as a special virtue with a determinate matter, it helps to
    resist the assaults of all vices. For he that can stand firm in things that
    are most difficult to bear, is prepared, in consequence, to resist those
    which are less difficult.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This objection takes fortitude in the
    first sense.

  <h3 align="left">Whether fortitude is about fear and dying?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that fortitude is not about fear and
    daring. For Gregory says (Moral. vii): "The fortitude of the just man is to
    overcome the flesh, to withstand self-indulgence, to quench the lusts of the
    present life." Therefore fortitude seems to be about pleasures rather than
    about fear and daring.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii), that
    it belongs to fortitude to face dangers and to bear toil. But this seemingly
    has nothing to do with the passions of fear and daring, but rather with a
    man's toilsome deeds and external dangers. Therefore fortitude is not about
    fear and daring.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, not only daring, but also hope, is
    opposed to fear, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS045.html#FSQ45OUTP1">Question [45]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS045.html#FSQ45A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2) in the
    treatise on passions. Therefore fortitude should not be about daring any
    more than about hope.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 7; iii, 9)
    that fortitude is about fear and daring.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS123.html#SSQ123A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), it belongs to the virtue of fortitude to remove any obstacle that
    withdraws the will from following the reason. Now to be withdrawn from
    something difficult belongs to the notion of fear, which denotes withdrawal
    from an evil that entails difficulty, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS042.html#FSQ42OUTP1">Question [42]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS042.html#FSQ42ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,5) in the treatise
    on passions. Hence fortitude is chiefly about fear of difficult things,
    which can withdraw the will from following the reason. And it behooves one
    not only firmly to bear the assault of these difficulties by restraining
    fear, but also moderately to withstand them, when, to wit, it is necessary
    to dispel them altogether in order to free oneself therefrom for the future,
    which seems to come under the notion of daring. Therefore fortitude is about
    fear and daring, as curbing fear and moderating daring.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gregory is speaking then of the
    fortitude of the just man, as to its common relation to all virtues. Hence
    he first of all mentions matters pertaining to temperance, as in the words
    quoted, and then adds that which pertains properly to fortitude as a special
    virtue, by saying: "To love the trials of this life for the sake of an
    eternal reward."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Dangers and toils do not withdraw the
    will from the course of reason, except in so far as they are an object of
    fear. Hence fortitude needs to be immediately about fear and daring, but
    mediately about dangers and toils, these being the objects of those
    passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Hope is opposed to fear on the part of
    the object, for hope is of good, fear of evil: whereas daring is about the
    same object, and is opposed to fear by way of approach and withdrawal, as
    stated above (FS, Question [45], Article [1]). And since fortitude properly
    regards those temporal evils that withdraw one from virtue, as appears from
    Tully's definition quoted in the Second Objection, it follows that fortitude
    properly is about fear and daring and not about hope, except in so far as it
    is connected with daring, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS045.html#FSQ45OUTP1">Question [45]</a>,

  <h3 align="left">Whether fortitude is only about dangers of death?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that fortitude is not only about dangers
    of death. For Augustine says (De Morib. Eccl. xv) that "fortitude is love
    bearing all things readily for the sake of the object beloved": and (Music.
    vi) he says that fortitude is "the love which dreads no hardship, not even
    death." Therefore fortitude is not only about danger of death, but also
    about other afflictions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, all the passions of the soul need to be
    reduced to a mean by some virtue. Now there is no other virtue reducing
    fears to a mean. Therefore fortitude is not only about fear of death, but
    also about other fears.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no virtue is about extremes. But fear of
    death is about an extreme, since it is the greatest of fears, as stated in
    Ethic. iii. Therefore the virtue of fortitude is not about fear of death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Andronicus says that "fortitude is a virtue
    of the irascible faculty that is not easily deterred by the fear of
    death."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS123.html#SSQ123A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), it belongs to the virtue of fortitude to guard the will against being
    withdrawn from the good of reason through fear of bodily evil. Now it
    behooves one to hold firmly the good of reason against every evil
    whatsoever, since no bodily good is equivalent to the good of the reason.
    Hence fortitude of soul must be that which binds the will firmly to the good
    of reason in face of the greatest evils: because he that stands firm against
    great things, will in consequence stand firm against less things, but not
    conversely. Moreover it belongs to the notion of virtue that it should
    regard something extreme: and the most fearful of all bodily evils is death,
    since it does away all bodily goods. Wherefore Augustine says (De Morib.
    Eccl. xxii) that "the soul is shaken by its fellow body, with fear of toil
    and pain, lest the body be stricken and harassed with fear of death lest it
    be done away and destroyed." Therefore the virtue of fortitude is about the
    fear of dangers of death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Fortitude behaves well in bearing all
    manner of adversity: yet a man is not reckoned brave simply through bearing
    any kind of adversity, but only through bearing well even the greatest
    evils; while through bearing others he is said to be brave in a restricted
    sense.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since fear is born of love, any virtue
    that moderates the love of certain goods must in consequence moderate the
    fear of contrary evils: thus liberality, which moderates the love of money,
    as a consequence, moderates the fear of losing it, and the same is the case
    with temperance and other virtues. But to love one's own life is natural:
    and hence the necessity of a special virtue modifying the fear of death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In virtues the extreme consists in
    exceeding right reason: wherefore to undergo the greatest dangers in
    accordance with reason is not contrary to virtue.<br />

    Whether fortitude is properly about dangers of death in battle?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that fortitude is not properly about
    dangers of death in battle. For martyrs above all are commended for their
    fortitude. But martyrs are not commended in connection with battle.
    Therefore fortitude is not properly about dangers of death in battle.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Ambrose says (De Offic. i) that
    "fortitude is applicable both to warlike and to civil matters": and Tully
    (De Offic. i), under the heading, "That it pertains to fortitude to excel in
    battle rather than in civil life," says: "Although not a few think that the
    business of war is of greater importance than the affairs of civil life,
    this opinion must be qualified: and if we wish to judge the matter truly,
    there are many things in civil life that are more important and more
    glorious than those connected with war." Now greater fortitude is about
    greater things. Therefore fortitude is not properly concerned with death in
    battle.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, war is directed to the preservation of a
    country's temporal peace: for Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix) that "wars
    are waged in order to insure peace." Now it does not seem that one ought to
    expose oneself to the danger of death for the temporal peace of one's
    country, since this same peace is the occasion of much license in morals.
    Therefore it seems that the virtue of fortitude is not about the danger of
    death in battle.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii) that
    fortitude is chiefly about death in battle.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS123.html#SSQ123A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >), fortitude strengthens a man's mind against the greatest danger, which is
    that of death. Now fortitude is a virtue; and it is essential to virtue ever
    to tend to good; wherefore it is in order to pursue some good that man does
    not fly from the danger of death. But the dangers of death arising out of
    sickness, storms at sea, attacks from robbers, and the like, do not seem to
    come on a man through his pursuing some good. on the other hand, the dangers
    of death which occur in battle come to man directly on account of some good,
    because, to wit, he is defending the common good by a just fight. Now a just
    fight is of two kinds. First, there is the general combat, for instance, of
    those who fight in battle; secondly, there is the private combat, as when a
    judge or even private individual does not refrain from giving a just
    judgment through fear of the impending sword, or any other danger though it
    threaten death. Hence it belongs to fortitude to strengthen the mind against
    dangers of death, not only such as arise in a general battle, but also such
    as occur in singular combat, which may be called by the general name of
    battle. Accordingly it must be granted that fortitude is properly about
    dangers of death occurring in battle.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, a brave man behaves well in face of danger of any other kind of
    death; especially since man may be in danger of any kind of death on account
    of virtue: thus may a man not fail to attend on a sick friend through fear
    of deadly infection, or not refuse to undertake a journey with some godly
    object in view through fear of shipwreck or robbers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Martyrs face the fight that is waged
    against their own person, and this for the sake of the sovereign good which
    is God; wherefore their fortitude is praised above all. Nor is it outside
    the genus of fortitude that regards warlike actions, for which reason they
    are said to have been valiant in battle. [*Office of Martyrs, ex. Heb. xi.
    34.]<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Personal and civil business is
    differentiated from the business of war that regards general wars. However,
    personal and civil affairs admit of dangers of death arising out of certain
    conflicts which are private wars, and so with regard to these also there may
    be fortitude properly so called.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The peace of the state is good in
    itself, nor does it become evil because certain persons make evil use of it.
    For there are many others who make good use of it; and many evils prevented
    by it, such as murders and sacrileges, are much greater than those which are
    occasioned by it, and which belong chiefly to the sins of the flesh.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether endurance is the chief act of fortitude?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that endurance is not the chief act of
    fortitude. For virtue "is about the difficult and the good" (Ethic. ii, 3).
    Now it is more difficult to attack than to endure. Therefore endurance is
    not the chief act of fortitude.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to be able to act on another seems to
    argue greater power than not to be changed by another. Now to attack is to
    act on another, and to endure is to persevere unchangeably. Since then
    fortitude denotes perfection of power, it seems that it belongs to fortitude
    to attack rather than to endure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one contrary is more distant from the
    other than its mere negation. Now to endure is merely not to fear, whereas
    to attack denotes a movement contrary to that of fear, since it implies
    pursuit. Since then fortitude above all withdraws the mind from fear, it
    seems that it regards attack rather than endurance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 9) that
    "certain persons are" said to be brave chiefly because they endure
    affliction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS123.html#SSQ123A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), and according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 9), "fortitude is more
    concerned to allay fear, than to moderate daring." For it is more difficult
    to allay fear than to moderate daring, since the danger which is the object
    of daring and fear, tends by its very nature to check daring, but to
    increase fear. Now to attack belongs to fortitude in so far as the latter
    moderates daring, whereas to endure follows the repression of fear.
    Therefore the principal act of fortitude is endurance, that is to stand
    immovable in the midst of dangers rather than to attack them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Endurance is more difficult than
    aggression, for three reasons. First, because endurance seemingly implies
    that one is being attacked by a stronger person, whereas aggression denotes
    that one is attacking as though one were the stronger party; and it is more
    difficult to contend with a stronger than with a weaker. Secondly, because
    he that endures already feels the presence of danger, whereas the aggressor
    looks upon danger as something to come; and it is more difficult to be
    unmoved by the present than by the future. Thirdly, because endurance
    implies length of time, whereas aggression is consistent with sudden
    movements; and it is more difficult to remain unmoved for a long time, than
    to be moved suddenly to something arduous. Hence the Philosopher says
    (Ethic. iii, 8) that "some hurry to meet danger, yet fly when the danger is
    present; this is not the behavior of a brave man."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Endurance denotes indeed a passion of
    the body, but an action of the soul cleaving most resolutely [fortissime] to
    good, the result being that it does not yield to the threatening passion of
    the body. Now virtue concerns the soul rather than the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He that endures fears not, though he is
    confronted with the cause of fear, whereas this cause is not present to the
    aggressor.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the brave man acts for the sake of the good of his habit?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the brave man does not act for the
    sake of the good of his habit. For in matters of action the end, though
    first in intention, is last in execution. Now the act of fortitude, in the
    order of execution, follows the habit of fortitude. Therefore it is
    impossible for the brave man to act for the sake of the good of his
    habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. xiii): "We love
    virtues for the sake of happiness, and yet some make bold to counsel us to
    be virtuous," namely by saying that we should desire virtue for its own
    sake, "without loving happiness. If they succeed in their endeavor, we shall
    surely cease to love virtue itself, since we shall no longer love that for
    the sake of which alone we love virtue." But fortitude is a virtue.
    Therefore the act of fortitude is directed not to fortitude but to
    happiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Morib. Eccl. xv) that
    "fortitude is love ready to bear all things for God's sake." Now God is not
    the habit of fortitude, but something better, since the end must needs be
    better than what is directed to the end. Therefore the brave man does not
    act for the sake of the good of his habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 7) that "to
    the brave man fortitude itself is a good": and such is his end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> An end is twofold: proximate and ultimate. Now
    the proximate end of every agent is to introduce a likeness of that agent's
    form into something else: thus the end of fire in heating is to introduce
    the likeness of its heat into some passive matter, and the end of the
    builder is to introduce into matter the likeness of his art. Whatever good
    ensues from this, if it be intended, may be called the remote end of the
    agent. Now just as in things made, external matter is fashioned by art, so
    in things done, human deeds are fashioned by prudence. Accordingly we must
    conclude that the brave man intends as his proximate end to reproduce in
    action a likeness of his habit, for he intends to act in accordance with his
    habit: but his remote end is happiness or God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This suffices for the Replies to the Objections: for the First Objection
    proceeds as though the very essence of a habit were its end, instead of the
    likeness of the habit in act, as stated. The other two objections consider
    the ultimate end.<br />

    ><br />
  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether the brave man delights in his act?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the brave man delights in his act.
    For "delight is the unhindered action of a connatural habit" (Ethic. x,
    4,6,8). Now the brave deed proceeds from a habit which acts after the manner
    of nature. Therefore the brave man takes pleasure in his act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Ambrose, commenting on Gal. 5:22, "But
    the fruit of the Spirit is charity, joy, peace," says that deeds of virtue
    are called "fruits because they refresh man's mind with a holy and pure
    delight." Now the brave man performs acts of virtue. Therefore he takes
    pleasure in his act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the weaker is overcome by the stronger.
    Now the brave man has a stronger love for the good of virtue than for his
    own body, which he exposes to the danger of death. Therefore the delight in
    the good of virtue banishes the pain of the body; and consequently the brave
    man does all things with pleasure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 9) that
    "the brave man seems to have no delight in his act."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS031.html#FSQ31OUTP1">Question [31]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS031.html#FSQ31ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4,5) where we were
    treating of the passions, pleasure is twofold; one is bodily, resulting from
    bodily contact, the other is spiritual, resulting from an apprehension of
    the soul. It is the latter which properly results from deeds of virtue,
    since in them we consider the good of reason. Now the principal act of
    fortitude is to endure, not only certain things that are unpleasant as
    apprehended by the soul---for instance, the loss of bodily life, which the
    virtuous man loves not only as a natural good, but also as being necessary
    for acts of virtue, and things connected with them---but also to endure
    things unpleasant in respect of bodily contact, such as wounds and blows.
    Hence the brave man, on one side, has something that affords him delight,
    namely as regards spiritual pleasure, in the act itself of virtue and the
    end thereof: while, on the other hand, he has cause for both spiritual
    sorrow, in the thought of losing his life, and for bodily pain. Hence we
    read (2 Macc. 6:30) that Eleazar said: "I suffer grievous pains in body: but
    in soul am well content to suffer these things because I fear Thee."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the sensible pain of the body makes one insensible to the spiritual
    delight of virtue, without the copious assistance of God's grace, which has
    more strength to raise the soul to the Divine things in which it delights,
    than bodily pains have to afflict it. Thus the Blessed Tiburtius, while
    walking barefoot on the burning coal, said that he felt as though he were
    walking on roses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet the virtue of fortitude prevents the reason from being entirely overcome
    by bodily pain. And the delight of virtue overcomes spiritual sorrow,
    inasmuch as a man prefers the good of virtue to the life of the body and to
    whatever appertains thereto. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 3; iii,
    9) that "it is not necessary for a brave man to delight so as to perceive
    his delight, but it suffices for him not to be sad."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The vehemence of the action or passion
    of one power hinders the action of another power: wherefore the pain in his
    senses hinders the mind of the brave man from feeling delight in its proper
    operation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Deeds of virtue are delightful chiefly
    on account of their end; yet they can be painful by their nature, and this
    is principally the case with fortitude. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic.
    iii, 9) that "to perform deeds with pleasure does not happen in all virtues,
    except in so far as one attains the end."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the brave man spiritual sorrow is
    overcome by the delight of virtue. Yet since bodily pain is more sensible,
    and the sensitive apprehension is more in evidence to man, it follows that
    spiritual pleasure in the end of virtue fades away, so to speak, in the
    presence of great bodily pain.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether fortitude deals chiefly with sudden occurrences?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that fortitude does not deal chiefly
    with sudden occurrences. For it would seem that things occur suddenly when
    they are unforeseen. But Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "fortitude is
    the deliberate facing of danger, and bearing of toil." Therefore fortitude
    does not deal chiefly with sudden happenings.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Ambrose says (De Offic. i): "The brave
    man is not unmindful of what may be likely to happen; he takes measures
    beforehand, and looks out as from the conning-tower of his mind, so as to
    encounter the future by his forethought, lest he should say afterwards: This
    befell me because I did not think it could possibly happen." But it is not
    possible to be prepared for the future in the case of sudden occurrences.
    Therefore the operation of fortitude is not concerned with sudden
    happenings.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 8)
    that the "brave man is of good hope." But hope looks forward to the future,
    which is inconsistent with sudden occurrences. Therefore the operation of
    fortitude is not concerned with sudden happenings.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 8) that
    "fortitude is chiefly about sudden dangers of death."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Two things must be considered in the operation
    of fortitude. One is in regard to its choice: and thus fortitude is not
    about sudden occurrences: because the brave man chooses to think beforehand
    of the dangers that may arise, in order to be able to withstand them, or to
    bear them more easily: since according to Gregory (Hom. xxv in Evang.), "the
    blow that is foreseen strikes with less force, and we are able more easily
    to bear earthly wrongs, if we are forearmed with the shield of
    foreknowledge." The other thing to be considered in the operation of
    fortitude regards the display of the virtuous habit: and in this way
    fortitude is chiefly about sudden occurrences, because according to the
    Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 8) the habit of fortitude is displayed chiefly in
    sudden dangers: since a habit works by way of nature. Wherefore if a person
    without forethought does that which pertains to virtue, when necessity urges
    on account of some sudden danger, this is a very strong proof that habitual
    fortitude is firmly seated in his mind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet is it possible for a person even without the habit of fortitude, to
    prepare his mind against danger by long forethought: in the same way as a
    brave man prepares himself when necessary. This suffices for the Replies to
    the Objections.<br />

    Whether the brave man makes use of anger in his action?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the brave man does not use anger in
    his action. For no one should employ as an instrument of his action that
    which he cannot use at will. Now man cannot use anger at will, so as to take
    it up and lay it aside when he will. For, as the Philosopher says (De
    Memoria ii), when a bodily passion is in movement, it does not rest at once
    just as one wishes. Therefore a brave man should not employ anger for his
    action.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if a man is competent to do a thing by
    himself, he should not seek the assistance of something weaker and more
    imperfect. Now the reason is competent to achieve by itself deeds of
    fortitude, wherein anger is impotent: wherefore Seneca says (De Ira i):
    "Reason by itself suffices not only to make us prepared for action but also
    to accomplish it. In fact is there greater folly than for reason to seek
    help from anger? the steadfast from the unstaid, the trusty from the
    untrustworthy, the healthy from the sick?" Therefore a brave man should not
    make use of anger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as people are more earnest in doing
    deeds of fortitude on account of anger, so are they on account of sorrow or
    desire; wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 8) that wild beasts are
    incited to face danger through sorrow or pain, and adulterous persons dare
    many things for the sake of desire. Now fortitude employs neither sorrow nor
    desire for its action. Therefore in like manner it should not employ
    anger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 8) that
    "anger helps the brave."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), concerning anger
    and the other passions there was a difference of opinion between the
    Peripatetics and the Stoics. For the Stoics excluded anger and all other
    passions of the soul from the mind of a wise or good man: whereas the
    Peripatetics, of whom Aristotle was the chief, ascribed to virtuous men both
    anger and the other passions of the soul albeit modified by reason. And
    possibly they differed not in reality but in their way of speaking. For the
    Peripatetics, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), gave the name of
    passions to all the movements of the sensitive appetite, however they may
    comport themselves. And since the sensitive appetite is moved by the command
    of reason, so that it may cooperate by rendering action more prompt, they
    held that virtuous persons should employ both anger and the other passions
    of the soul, modified according to the dictate of reason. On the other hand,
    the Stoics gave the name of passions to certain immoderate emotions of the
    sensitive appetite, wherefore they called them sicknesses or diseases, and
    for this reason severed them altogether from virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly the brave man employs moderate anger for his action, but not
    immoderate anger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Anger that is moderated in accordance
    with reason is subject to the command of reason: so that man uses it at his
    will, which would not be the case were it immoderate.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Reason employs anger for its action, not
    as seeking its assistance, but because it uses the sensitive appetite as an
    instrument, just as it uses the members of the body. Nor is it unbecoming
    for the instrument to be more imperfect than the principal agent, even as
    the hammer is more imperfect than the smith. Moreover, Seneca was a follower
    of the Stoics, and the above words were aimed by him directly at
    Aristotle.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Whereas fortitude, as stated above (<a
      href="SS123.html#SSQ123A6THEP1"
      >Article [6]</a
    >), has two acts, namely endurance and aggression, it employs anger, not for
    the act of endurance, because the reason by itself performs this act, but
    for the act of aggression, for which it employs anger rather than the other
    passions, since it belongs to anger to strike at the cause of sorrow, so
    that it directly cooperates with fortitude in attacking. On the other hand,
    sorrow by its very nature gives way to the thing that hurts; though
    accidentally it helps in aggression, either as being the cause of anger, as
    stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS047.html#FSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS047.html#FSQ47A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), or as making a
    person expose himself to danger in order to escape from sorrow. In like
    manner desire, by its very nature, tends to a pleasurable good, to which it
    is directly contrary to withstand danger: yet accidentally sometimes it
    helps one to attack, in so far as one prefers to risk dangers rather than
    lack pleasure. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 5): "Of all the cases
    in which fortitude arises from a passion, the most natural is when a man is
    brave through anger, making his choice and acting for a purpose," i.e. for a
    due end; "this is true fortitude."<br />

  <h3 align="center">Whether fortitude is a cardinal virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that fortitude is not a cardinal virtue.
    For, as stated above (<a href="SS123.html#SSQ123A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>),
    anger is closely allied with fortitude. Now anger is not accounted a
    principal passion; nor is daring which belongs to fortitude. Therefore
    neither should fortitude be reckoned a cardinal virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the object of virtue is good. But the
    direct object of fortitude is not good, but evil, for it is endurance of
    evil and toil, as Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii). Therefore fortitude is
    not a cardinal virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the cardinal virtues are about those
    things upon which human life is chiefly occupied, just as a door turns upon
    a hinge [cardine]. But fortitude is about dangers of death which are of rare
    occurrence in human life. Therefore fortitude should not be reckoned a
    cardinal or principal virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxii), Ambrose in his
    commentary on Lk. 6:20, and Augustine (De Moribus Eccl. xv), number
    fortitude among the four cardinal or principal virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), those virtues
    are said to be cardinal or principal which have a foremost claim to that
    which belongs to the virtues in common. And among other conditions of virtue
    in general one is that it is stated to "act steadfastly," according to
    Ethic. ii, 4. Now fortitude above all lays claim to praise for
    steadfastness. Because he that stands firm is so much the more praised, as
    he is more strongly impelled to fall or recede. Now man is impelled to
    recede from that which is in accordance with reason, both by the pleasing
    good and the displeasing evil. But bodily pain impels him more strongly than
    pleasure. For Augustine says (<a href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1"
      >Questions [83]</a
    >, qu. 36): "There is none that does not shun pain more than he desires
    pleasure. For we perceive that even the most untamed beasts are deterred
    from the greatest pleasures by the fear of pain." And among the pains of the
    mind and dangers those are mostly feared which lead to death, and it is
    against them that the brave man stands firm. Therefore fortitude is a
    cardinal virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Daring and anger do not cooperate with
    fortitude in its act of endurance, wherein its steadfastness is chiefly
    commended: for it is by that act that the brave man curbs fear, which is a
    principal passion, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS025.html#FSQ25A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Virtue is directed to the good of reason
    which it behooves to safeguard against the onslaught of evils. And fortitude
    is directed to evils of the body, as contraries which it withstands, and to
    the good of reason, as the end, which it intends to safeguard.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Though dangers of death are of rare
    occurrence, yet the occasions of those dangers occur frequently, since on
    account of justice which he pursues, and also on account of other good
    deeds, man encounters mortal adversaries.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether fortitude excels among all other virtues?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that fortitude excels among all other
    virtues. For Ambrose says (De Offic. i): "Fortitude is higher, so to speak,
    than the rest."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, virtue is about that which is difficult
    and good. But fortitude is about most difficult things. Therefore it is the
    greatest of the virtues.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the person of a man is more excellent
    than his possessions. But fortitude is about a man's person, for it is this
    that a man exposes to the danger of death for the good of virtue: whereas
    justice and the other moral virtues are about other and external things.
    Therefore fortitude is the chief of the moral virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> On the contrary, Tully says (De Offic. i):
    "Justice is the most resplendent of the virtues and gives its name to a good
    man."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. i, 19):
    "Those virtues must needs be greatest which are most profitable to others."
    Now liberality seems to be more useful than fortitude. Therefore it is a
    greater virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Trin. vi), "In things
    that are great, but not in bulk, to be great is to be good": wherefore the
    better a virtue the greater it is. Now reason's good is man's good,
    according to Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv) prudence, since it is a perfection of
    reason, has the good essentially: while justice effects this good, since it
    belongs to justice to establish the order of reason in all human affairs:
    whereas the other virtues safeguard this good, inasmuch as they moderate the
    passions, lest they lead man away from reason's good. As to the order of the
    latter, fortitude holds the first place, because fear of dangers of death
    has the greatest power to make man recede from the good of reason: and after
    fortitude comes temperance, since also pleasures of touch excel all others
    in hindering the good of reason. Now to be a thing essentially ranks before
    effecting it, and the latter ranks before safeguarding it by removing
    obstacles thereto. Wherefore among the cardinal virtues, prudence ranks
    first, justice second, fortitude third, temperance fourth, and after these
    the other virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Ambrose places fortitude before the
    other virtues, in respect of a certain general utility, inasmuch as it is
    useful both in warfare, and in matters relating to civil or home life. Hence
    he begins by saying (De Offic. i): "Now we come to treat of fortitude, which
    being higher so to speak than the others, is applicable both to warlike and
    to civil matters."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Virtue essentially regards the good
    rather than the difficult. Hence the greatness of a virtue is measured
    according to its goodness rather than its difficulty.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A man does not expose his person to
    dangers of death except in order to safeguard justice: wherefore the praise
    awarded to fortitude depends somewhat on justice. Hence Ambrose says (De
    Offic. i) that "fortitude without justice is an occasion of injustice; since
    the stronger a man is the more ready is he to oppress the weaker."<br />
  </p>
  <p>The Fourth argument is granted.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Liberality is useful in conferring
    certain particular favors: whereas a certain general utility attaches to
    fortitude, since it safeguards the whole order of justice. Hence the
    Philosopher says (Rhet. i, 9) that "just and brave men are most beloved,
    because they are most useful in war and peace."<br />
