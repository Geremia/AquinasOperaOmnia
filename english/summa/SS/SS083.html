<H3 Align="Left">Whether prayer is an act of the appetitive power?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prayer is an act of the appetitive power. It 
belongs to prayer to be heard. Now it is the desire that is heard by God, 
according to Ps. 9:38, "The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor." 
Therefore prayer is desire. But desire is an act of the appetitive power: 
and therefore prayer is also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iii): "It is useful to begin 
everything with prayer, because thereby we surrender ourselves to God and 
unite ourselves to Him." Now union with God is effected by love which 
belongs to the appetitive power. Therefore prayer belongs to the 
appetitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher states (De Anima iii, 6) that there are 
two operations of the intellective part. Of these the  first is "the 
understanding of indivisibles," by which operation we apprehend what a 
thing is: while the second is "synthesis" and "analysis," whereby we 
apprehend that a thing is or is not. To these a third may be added, 
namely, "reasoning," whereby we proceed from the known to the unknown. 
Now prayer is not reducible to any of these operations. Therefore it is 
an operation, not of the intellective, but of the appetitive power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says (Etym. x) that "to pray is to speak." Now 
speech belongs to the intellect. Therefore prayer is an act, not of the 
appetitive, but of the intellective power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to Cassiodorus [*Comment. in Ps. 38:13] "prayer 
[oratio] is spoken reason [oris ratio]." Now the speculative and 
practical reason differ in this, that the speculative merely apprehends 
its object, whereas the practical reason not only apprehends but causes. 
Now one thing is the cause of another in two ways: first perfectly, when 
it necessitates its effect, and this happens when the effect is wholly 
subject to the power of the cause; secondly imperfectly, by merely 
disposing to the effect, for the reason that the effect is not wholly 
subject to the power of the cause. Accordingly in this way the reason is 
cause of certain things in two ways: first, by imposing necessity; and in 
this way it belongs to reason, to command not only the lower powers and 
the members of the body, but also human subjects, which indeed is done by 
commanding; secondly, by leading up to the effect, and, in a way, 
disposing to it, and in this sense the reason asks for something to be 
done by things not subject to it, whether they be its equals or its 
superiors. Now both of these, namely, to command and to ask or beseech, 
imply a certain ordering, seeing that man proposes something to be 
effected by something else, wherefore they pertain to the reason to which 
it belongs to set in order. For this reason the Philosopher says (Ethic. 
i, 13) that the "reason exhorts us to do what is best."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in the present instance we are speaking of prayer [*This last 
paragraph refers to the Latin word 'oratio' [prayer] which originally 
signified a speech, being derived in the first instance from 'os,' 'oris' 
(the mouth).] as signifying a beseeching or petition, in which sense 
Augustine [*Rabanus, De Univ. vi, 14]: says (De Verb. Dom.) that "prayer 
is a petition," and Damascene states (De Fide Orth. iii, 24) that "to 
pray is to ask becoming things of God." Accordingly it is evident that 
prayer, as we speak of it now, is an act of reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Lord is said to hear the desire of the poor, either 
because desire is the cause of their petition, since a petition is like 
the interpreter of a desire, or in order to show how speedily they are 
heard, since no sooner do the poor desire something than God hears them 
before they put up a prayer, according to the saying of Is. 65:24, "And 
it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will hear."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP082.html#FPQ82OUTP1">Question [82]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP082.html#FPQ82A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3),  
the will moves the reason to its end: wherefore nothing hinders the act 
of reason, under the motion of the will, from tending to an end such as 
charity which is union with God. Now prayer tends to God through being 
moved by the will of charity, as it were, and this in two ways. First, on 
the part of the object of our petition, because when we pray we ought 
principally to ask to be united to God, according to Ps. 26:4, "One thing 
I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after, that I may dwell in the 
house of the Lord all the days of my life." Secondly, on the part of the 
petitioner, who ought to approach the person whom he petitions, either 
locally, as when he petitions a man, or mentally, as when he petitions 
God. Hence Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iii) that "when we call upon God in 
our prayers, we unveil our mind in His presence": and in the same sense 
Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 24) that "prayer is the raising up of 
the mind to God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> These three acts belong to the speculative reason, but to 
the practical reason it belongs in addition to cause something by way of 
command or of petition, as stated above.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is becoming to pray?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is unbecoming to pray. Prayer seems to be 
necessary in order that we may make our needs known to the person to whom 
we pray. But according to Mt. 6:32, "Your Father knoweth that you have 
need of all these things." Therefore it is not becoming to pray to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by prayer we bend the mind of the person to whom we 
pray, so that he may do what is asked of him. But God's mind is 
unchangeable and inflexible, according to 1 Kgs. 15:29, "But the 
Triumpher in Israel will not spare, and will not be moved to repentance." 
Therefore it is not fitting that we should pray to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is more liberal to give to one that asks not, than to 
one who asks because, according to Seneca (De Benefic. ii, 1), "nothing 
is bought more dearly than what is bought with prayers." But God is 
supremely liberal. Therefore it would seem unbecoming to pray to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++18:1">Lk. 18:1</a>): "We ought always to pray, and 
not to faint."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Among the ancients there was a threefold error concerning 
prayer. Some held that human affairs are not ruled by Divine providence; 
whence it would follow that it is useless to pray and to worship God at 
all: of these it is written (Malach. 3:14): "You have said: He laboreth 
in vain that serveth God." Another opinion held that all things, even in 
human affairs, happen of necessity, whether by reason of the 
unchangeableness of Divine providence, or through the compelling 
influence of the stars, or on account of the connection of causes: and 
this opinion also excluded  the utility of prayer. There was a third 
opinion of those who held that human affairs are indeed ruled by Divine 
providence, and that they do not happen of necessity; yet they deemed the 
disposition of Divine providence to be changeable, and that it is changed 
by prayers and other things pertaining to the worship of God. All these 
opinions were disproved in the FP, Question [19], Articles [7],8; FP, Question [22], Articles [2],4; 
FP, Question [115], Article [6]; FP, Question [116]. Wherefore it behooves us so to account for 
the utility of prayer as neither to impose necessity on human affairs 
subject to Divine providence, nor to imply changeableness on the part of 
the Divine disposition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to throw light on this question we must consider that Divine 
providence disposes not only what effects shall take place, but also from 
what causes and in what order these effects shall proceed. Now among 
other causes human acts are the causes of certain effects. Wherefore it 
must be that men do certain actions. not that thereby they may change the 
Divine disposition, but that by those actions they may achieve certain 
effects according to the order of the Divine disposition: and the same is 
to be said of natural causes. And so is it with regard to prayer. For we 
pray not that we may change the Divine disposition, but that we may 
impetrate that which God has disposed to be fulfilled by our prayers in 
other words "that by asking, men may deserve to receive what Almighty God 
from eternity has disposed to give," as Gregory says (Dial. i, 8)<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We need to pray to God, not in order to make known to Him 
our needs or desires but that we ourselves may be reminded of the 
necessity of having recourse to God's help in these matters.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above, our motive in praying is, not Divine 
disposition, we may change the Divine disposition, but that, by our 
prayers, we may obtain what God has appointed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God bestows many things on us out of His liberality, even 
without our asking for them: but that He wishes to bestow certain things 
on us at our asking, is for the sake of our good, namely, that we may 
acquire confidence in having recourse to God, and that we may recognize 
in Him the Author of our goods. Hence Chrysostom says [*Implicitly [Hom. 
ii, de Orat.: Hom. xxx in Genes. ]; Cf. Caten. Aur. on Lk. 18]: "Think 
what happiness is granted thee, what honor bestowed on thee, when thou 
conversest with God in prayer, when thou talkest with Christ, when thou 
askest what thou wilt, whatever thou desirest."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether prayer is an act of religion?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prayer is not an act of religion. Since 
religion is a part of justice, it resides in the will as in its subject. 
But prayer belongs to the intellective part, as stated above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
Therefore prayer seems to be an act, not of religion, but of the gift of 
understanding whereby the mind ascends to God. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the act of "latria" falls under a necessity of precept. 
But prayer does not seem to come under a necessity of precept, but to 
come from the mere will, since it is nothing else than a petition for 
what we will. Therefore prayer seemingly is not an act of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it seems to belong to religion that one "offers worship 
end ceremonial rites to the Godhead" [*Cicero, Rhet. ii, 53]. But prayer 
seems not to offer anything to God, but to. ask to obtain something from 
Him. Therefore prayer is not an act of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++140:2">Ps. 140:2</a>): "Let my prayer be directed 
as incense in Thy sight": and a gloss on the passage says that "it was to 
signify this that under the old Law incense was said to be offered for a 
sweet smell to the Lord." Now this belongs to religion. Therefore prayer 
is an act of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4), it belongs properly to 
religion to show honor to God, wherefore all those things through which 
reverence is shown to God, belong to religion. Now man shows reverence to 
God by means of prayer, in so far as he subjects himself to Him, and by 
praying confesses that he needs Him as the Author of his goods. Hence it 
is evident that prayer is properly an act of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The will moves the other powers of the soul to its end, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS082.html#SSQ82OUTP1">Question [82]</a>, <A Href="SS082.html#SSQ82A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), and therefore religion, which is in the 
will, directs the acts of the other powers to the reverence of God. Now 
among the other powers of the soul the intellect is the highest, and the 
nearest to the will; and consequently after devotion which belongs to the 
will, prayer which belongs to the intellective part is the chief of the 
acts of religion, since by it religion directs man's intellect to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is a matter of precept not only that we should ask for 
what we desire, but also that we should desire aright. But to desire 
comes under a precept of charity, whereas to ask comes under a precept of 
religion, which precept is expressed in Mt. 7:7, where it is said: "Ask 
and ye shall receive" [*Vulg.: 'Ask and it shall be given you.'].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> By praying man surrenders his mind to God, since he 
subjects it to Him with reverence and, so to speak, presents it to Him, 
as appears from the words of Dionysius quoted above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, Objection [2]). 
Wherefore just as the human mind excels exterior things, whether bodily 
members, or those external things that are employed for God's service, so 
too, prayer surpasses other acts of religion.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought to pray to God alone.  Prayer is an 
act of religion, as stated above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But God alone is to be worshiped 
by religion. Therefore we should pray to God alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is useless to pray to one who is ignorant of the 
prayer. But it belongs to God alone to know one's prayer, both because 
frequently prayer is uttered by an interior act which God alone knows, 
rather than by words, according to the saying of the Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++14:15">1 Cor. 14:15</a>), "I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the 
understanding": and again because, as Augustine says (De Cura pro mortuis 
xiii) the "dead, even the saints, know not what the living, even their 
own children, are doing." Therefore we ought to pray to God alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if we pray to any of the saints, this is only because 
they are united to God. Now some yet living in this world, or even some 
who are in Purgatory, are closely united to God by grace, and yet we do 
not pray to them. Therefore neither should we pray to the saints who are 
in Paradise.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+5:1">Job 5:1</a>), "Call . . . if there be any 
that will answer thee, and turn to some of the saints."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Prayer is offered to a person in two ways: first, as to 
be fulfilled by him, secondly, as to be obtained through him. In the 
first way we offer prayer to God alone, since all our prayers ought to be 
directed to the acquisition of grace and glory, which God alone gives, 
according to Ps. 83:12, "The Lord will give grace and glory." But in the 
second way we pray to the saints, whether angels or men, not that God may 
through them know our petitions, but that our prayers may be effective 
through their prayers and merits. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rev+++8:4">Apoc. 8:4</a>) that 
"the smoke of the incense," namely "the prayers of the saints ascended up 
before God." This is also clear from the very style employed by the 
Church in praying: since we beseech the Blessed Trinity "to have mercy on 
us," while we ask any of the saints "to pray for us."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To Him alone do we offer religious worship when praying, 
from Whom we seek to obtain what we pray for, because by so doing we 
confess that He is the Author of our goods: but not to those whom we call 
upon as our advocates in God's presence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The dead, if we consider their natural condition, do not 
know what takes place in this world, especially the interior movements of 
the heart. Nevertheless, according to Gregory (Moral. xii, 21), whatever 
it is fitting the blessed should know about what happens to us, even as 
regards the interior movements of the heart, is made known to them in the 
Word: and it is most becoming to their exalted position that they should 
know the petitions we make to them by word or thought; and consequently 
the petitions which we raise to them are known to them through Divine 
manifestation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who are in this world or in Purgatory, do not yet 
enjoy the vision of the Word, so as to be able to know what  we think or 
say. Wherefore we do not seek their assistance by praying to them, but 
ask it of the living by speaking to them.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought not to ask for anything definite when 
we pray to God. According to Damascene (De Fide Orth. iii, 24), "to pray 
is to ask becoming things of God"; wherefore it is useless to pray for 
what is inexpedient, according to James 4:3, "You ask, and receive not: 
because you ask amiss." Now according to Rm. 8:26, "we know not what we 
should pray for as we ought." Therefore we ought not to ask for anything 
definite when we pray.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those who ask another person for something definite 
strive to incline his will to do what they wish themselves. But we ought 
not to endeavor to make God will what we will; on the contrary, we ought 
to strive to will what He wills, according to a gloss on Ps. 32:1, 
"Rejoice in the Lord, O ye just." Therefore we ought not to ask God for 
anything definite when we pray.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, evil things are not to be sought from God; and as to 
good things, God Himself invites us to take them. Now it is useless to 
ask a person to give you what he invites you to take. Therefore we ought 
not to ask God for anything definite in our prayers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++6+and+Lk++11">Mt. 6 and Lk. 11</a>) taught His disciples to ask 
definitely for those things which are contained in the petitions of the 
Lord's Prayer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to Valerius Maximus [*Fact. et Dict. Memor. 
vii, 2], "Socrates deemed that we should ask the immortal gods for 
nothing else but that they should grant us good things, because they at 
any rate know what is good for each one whereas when we pray we 
frequently ask for what it had been better for us not to obtain." This 
opinion is true to a certain extent, as to those things which may have an 
evil result, and which man may use ill or well, such as "riches, by 
which," as stated by the same authority (Fact. et Dict. Memor. vii, 2), 
"many have come to an evil end; honors, which have ruined many; power, of 
which we frequently witness the unhappy results; splendid marriages, 
which sometimes bring about the total wreck of a family." Nevertheless 
there are certain goods which man cannot ill use, because they cannot 
have an evil result. Such are those which are the object of beatitude and 
whereby we merit it: and these the saints seek absolutely when they pray, 
as in Ps. 79:4, "Show us Thy face, and we shall be saved," and again in 
Ps. 118:35, "Lead me into the path of Thy commandments."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although man cannot by himself know what he ought to pray 
for, "the Spirit," as stated in the same passage, "helpeth our 
infirmity," since by inspiring us with holy desires, He makes  us ask for 
what is right. Hence our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++4:24">Jn. 4:24</a>) that true adorers "must 
adore . . . in spirit and in truth."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When in our prayers we ask for things concerning our 
salvation, we conform our will to God's, of Whom it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++2:4">1 Tim. 2:4</a>) that "He will have all men to be saved."
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God so invites us to take good things, that we may approach 
to them not by the steps of the body, but by pious desires and devout 
prayers.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether man ought to ask God for temporal things when he prays?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man ought not to ask God for temporal things 
when he prays. We seek what we ask for in prayer. But we should not seek 
for temporal things, for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++6:33">Mt. 6:33</a>): "Seek ye . . . first 
the kingdom of God, and His justice: and all these things shall be added 
unto you," that is to say, temporal things, which, says He, we are not to 
seek, but they will be added to what we seek. Therefore temporal things 
are not to be asked of God in prayer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one asks save for that which he is solicitous about. 
Now we ought not to have solicitude for temporal things, according to the 
saying of Mt. 6:25, "Be not solicitous for your life, what you shall 
eat." Therefore we ought not to ask for temporal things when we pray.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by prayer our mind should be raised up to God. But by 
asking for temporal things, it descends to things beneath it, against the 
saying of the Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++4:18">2 Cor. 4:18</a>), "While we look not at the things 
which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things 
which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are 
eternal." Therefore man ought not to ask God for temporal things when he 
prays.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[6] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, man ought not to ask of God other than good and useful 
things. But sometimes temporal things, when we have them, are harmful, 
not only in a spiritual sense, but also in a material sense. Therefore we 
should not ask God for them in our prayers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++30:8">Prov. 30:8</a>): "Give me only the 
necessaries of life."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (ad Probam, de orando Deum, Ep. cxxx, 
12): "It is lawful to pray for what it is lawful to desire." Now it is 
lawful to desire temporal things, not indeed principally, by placing our 
end therein, but as helps whereby we are assisted in tending towards 
beatitude, in so far, to wit, as they are the means of supporting the 
life of the body, and are of service to us as instruments in performing 
acts of virtue, as also the Philosopher states (Ethic. i, 8). Augustine 
too says the same  to Proba (ad Probam, de orando Deum, Ep. cxxx, 6,7) 
when he states that "it is not unbecoming for anyone to desire enough for 
a livelihood, and no more; for this sufficiency is desired, not for its 
own sake, but for the welfare of the body, or that we should desire to be 
clothed in a way befitting one's station, so as not to be out of keeping 
with those among whom we have to live. Accordingly we ought to pray that 
we may keep these things if we have them, and if we have them not, that 
we may gain possession of them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We should seek temporal things not in the first but in the 
second place. Hence Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 16): "When 
He says that this" (i.e. the kingdom of God) "is to be sought first, He 
implies that the other" (i.e. temporal goods) "is to be sought 
afterwards, not in time but in importance, this as being our good, the 
other as our need."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Not all solicitude about temporal things is forbidden, but 
that which is superfluous and inordinate, as stated above (<A Href="SS055.html#SSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="SS055.html#SSQ55A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When our mind is intent on temporal things in order that it 
may rest in them, it remains immersed therein; but when it is intent on 
them in relation to the acquisition of beatitude, it is not lowered by 
them, but raises them to a higher level.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[6] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> From the very fact that we ask for temporal things not as 
the principal object of our petition, but as subordinate to something 
else, we ask God for them in the sense that they may be granted to us in 
so far as they are expedient for salvation.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought not to pray for others. In praying we 
ought to conform to the pattern given by our Lord. Now in the Lord's 
Prayer we make petitions for ourselves, not for others; thus we say: 
"Give us this day our daily bread," etc. Therefore we should not pray for 
others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prayer is offered that it may be heard. Now one of the 
conditions required for prayer that it may be heard is that one pray for 
oneself, wherefore Augustine in commenting on Jn. 16:23, "If you ask the 
Father anything in My name He will give it you," says (Tract. cii): 
"Everyone is heard when he prays for himself, not when he prays for all; 
wherefore He does not say simply 'He will give it,' but 'He will give it 
you. '" Therefore it would seem that we ought not to pray for others, but 
only for ourselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we are forbidden to pray for others, if they are wicked, 
according to Jer. 7:16, "Therefore do not then pray for  this people . . 
. and do not withstand Me, for I will not hear thee." On the other hand 
we are not bound to pray for the good, since they are heard when they 
pray for themselves. Therefore it would seem that we ought not to pray 
for others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+5:16">James 5:16</a>): "Pray one for another, that 
you may be saved."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), when we pray we ought to ask for 
what we ought to desire. Now we ought to desire good things not only for 
ourselves, but also for others: for this is essential to the love which 
we owe to our neighbor, as stated above (<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,12; <A Href="SS027.html#SSQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>, <A Href="SS027.html#SSQ27A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="SS031.html#SSQ31OUTP1">Question [31]</a>, <A Href="SS031.html#SSQ31A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore charity requires us to pray for others. Hence 
Chrysostom says (Hom. xiv in Matth.) [*Opus Imperfectum, falsely ascribed 
to St. John Chrysostom]: "Necessity binds us to pray for ourselves, 
fraternal charity urges us to pray for others: and the prayer that 
fraternal charity proffers is sweeter to God than that which is the 
outcome of necessity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Cyprian says (De orat. Dom.), "We say 'Our Father' and 
not 'My Father,' 'Give us' and not 'Give me,' because the Master of unity 
did not wish us to pray privately, that is for ourselves alone, for He 
wished each one to pray for all, even as He Himself bore all in one."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is a condition of prayer that one pray for oneself: not 
as though it were necessary in order that prayer be meritorious, but as 
being necessary in order that prayer may not fail in its effect of 
impetration. For it sometimes happens that we pray for another with piety 
and perseverance, and ask for things relating to his salvation, and yet 
it is not granted on account of some obstacle on the part of the person 
we are praying for, according to Jer. 15:1, "If Moses and Samuel shall 
stand before Me, My soul is not towards this people." And yet the prayer 
will be meritorious for the person who prays thus out of charity, 
according to Ps. 34:13, "My prayer shall be turned into my bosom, i.e. 
though it profit them not, I am not deprived of my reward," as the gloss 
expounds it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> We ought to pray even for sinners, that they may be 
converted, and for the just that they may persevere and advance in 
holiness. Yet those who pray are heard not for all sinners but for some: 
since they are heard for the predestined, but not for those who are 
foreknown to death; even as the correction whereby we correct the 
brethren, has an effect in the predestined but not in the reprobate, 
according to Eccles. 7:14, "No man can correct whom God hath despised." 
Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++5:16">1 Jn. 5:16</a>): "He that knoweth his brother to sin a 
sin which is not to death, let him ask, and life shall be given to him, 
who sinneth not to death." Now just as the benefit of correction must not 
be refused to any man so long as he lives here below, because we cannot 
distinguish the predestined from the reprobate, as Augustine says (De 
Correp. et Grat. xv), so too no man should be denied the help of prayer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We ought also to pray for the just for three reasons: First, because the 
prayers of a multitude are more easily heard, wherefore a gloss on Rm. 
15:30, "Help me in your prayers," says: "The Apostle rightly tells the 
lesser brethren to pray for him, for many lesser ones, if they be united 
together in one mind, become great, and it is impossible for the prayers 
of a multitude not to obtain" that which is possible to be obtained by 
prayer. Secondly, that many may thank God for the graces conferred on the 
just, which graces conduce to the profit of many, according to the 
Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++1:11">2 Cor. 1:11</a>). Thirdly, that the more perfect may not wax proud, 
seeing that they find that they need the prayers of the less perfect.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought not to pray for our enemies. 
According to Rm. 15:4, "what things soever were written, were written for 
our learning." Now Holy Writ contains many imprecations against enemies; 
thus it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++6:11">Ps. 6:11</a>): "Let all my enemies be ashamed and be . . 
. troubled, let them be ashamed and be troubled very speedily [*Vulg.: 
'Let them be turned back and be ashamed.']." Therefore we too should pray 
against rather than for our enemies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to be revenged on one's enemies is harmful to them. But 
holy men seek vengeance of their enemies according to Apoc. 6:10, "How 
long . . . dost Thou not . . . revenge our blood on them that dwell on 
earth?" Wherefore they rejoice in being revenged on their enemies, 
according to Ps. 57:11, "The just shall rejoice when he shall see the 
revenge." Therefore we should not pray for our enemies, but against them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man's deed should not be contrary to his prayer. Now 
sometimes men lawfully attack their enemies, else all wars would be 
unlawful, which is opposed to what we have said above (<A Href="SS040.html#SSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="SS040.html#SSQ40A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
Therefore we should not pray for our enemies.<br>

and calumniate you."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[8] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> To pray for another is an act of charity, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Wherefore we are bound to pray for our enemies in the same manner 
as we are bound to love them. Now it was explained above in the treatise 
on charity (<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25ATHEP1">Articles [8]</a>,9), how we are bound to love our enemies, 
namely, that we must love in them their nature, not their sin. and that 
to love our enemies in general is a matter of precept, while to love them 
in the individual is not a matter of precept, except in the preparedness 
of the mind, so that a man must be prepared to love his enemy even in the 
individual and to help him in a case of necessity, or if his enemy should 
beg his forgiveness. But to love one's enemies absolutely in the 
individual, and to assist them, is an act of perfection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[8] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner it is a matter of obligation that we should not  exclude 
our enemies from the general prayers which we offer up for others: but it 
is a matter of perfection, and not of obligation, to pray for them 
individually, except in certain special cases.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The imprecations contained in Holy Writ may be understood 
in four ways. First, according to the custom of the prophets "to foretell 
the future under the veil of an imprecation," as Augustine states [*De 
Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 21]. Secondly, in the sense that certain temporal 
evils are sometimes inflicted by God on the wicked for their correction. 
Thirdly, because they are understood to be pronounced, not against the 
men themselves, but against the kingdom of sin, with the purpose, to wit, 
of destroying sin by the correction of men. Fourthly, by way of 
conformity of our will to the Divine justice with regard to the damnation 
of those who are obstinate in sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine states in the same book (De Serm. Dom. in 
Monte i, 22), "the martyrs' vengeance is the overthrow of the kingdom of 
sin, because they suffered so much while it reigned": or as he says again 
(Questions. Vet. et Nov. Test. lxviii), "their prayer for vengeance is expressed 
not in words but in their minds, even as the blood of Abel cried from the 
earth." They rejoice in vengeance not for its own sake, but for the sake 
of Divine justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is lawful to attack one's enemies, that they may be 
restrained from sin: and this is for their own good and for the good of 
others. Consequently it is even lawful in praying to ask that temporal 
evils be inflicted on our enemies in order that they may mend their ways. 
Thus prayer and deed will not be contrary to one another.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the seven petitions of the Lord's Prayer are fittingly assigned?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the seven petitions of the Lord's Prayer are 
not fittingly assigned. It is useless to ask for that to be hallowed 
which is always holy. But the name of God is always holy, according to 
Lk. 1:49, "Holy is His name." Again, His kingdom is everlasting, 
according to Ps. 144:13, "Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages." Again, 
God's will is always fulfilled, according to Isa 46:10, "All My will 
shall be done." Therefore it is useless to ask for "the name of God to be 
hallowed," for "His kingdom to come," and for "His will to be done."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one must withdraw from evil before attaining good. 
Therefore it seems unfitting for the petitions relating to the attainment 
of good to be set forth before those relating to the removal of evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one asks for a thing that it may be given to one. Now 
the chief gift of God is the Holy Ghost, and those gifts that we receive 
through Him. Therefore the petitions seem to be  unfittingly assigned, 
since they do not correspond to the gifts of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, according to Luke, only five petitions are mentioned in 
the Lord's Prayer, as appears from the eleventh chapter. Therefore it was 
superfluous for Matthew to mention seven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, it seems useless to seek to win the benevolence of one 
who forestalls us by his benevolence. Now God forestalls us by His 
benevolence, since "He first hath loved us" ( 1 Jn. 4:19). Therefore it 
is useless to preface the petitions with the words our "Father Who art in 
heaven," which seem to indicate a desire to win God's benevolence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The authority of Christ, who composed this prayer, 
suffices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The Lord's Prayer is most perfect, because, as Augustine 
says (ad Probam Ep. cxxx, 12), "if we pray rightly and fittingly, we can 
say nothing else but what is contained in this prayer of our Lord." For 
since prayer interprets our desires, as it were, before God, then alone 
is it right to ask for something in our prayers when it is right that we 
should desire it. Now in the Lord's Prayer not only do we ask for all 
that we may rightly desire, but also in the order wherein we ought to 
desire them, so that this prayer not only teaches us to ask, but also 
directs all our affections. Thus it is evident that the first thing to be 
the object of our desire is the end, and afterwards whatever is directed 
to the end. Now our end is God towards Whom our affections tend in two 
ways: first, by our willing the glory of God, secondly, by willing to 
enjoy His glory. The first belongs to the love whereby we love God in 
Himself, while the second belongs to the love whereby we love ourselves 
in God. Wherefore the first petition is expressed thus: "Hallowed be Thy 
name," and the second thus: "Thy kingdom come," by which we ask to come 
to the glory of His kingdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To this same end a thing directs us in two ways: in one way, by its very 
nature, in another way, accidentally. Of its very nature the good which 
is useful for an end directs us to that end. Now a thing is useful in two 
ways to that end which is beatitude: in one way, directly and 
principally, according to the merit whereby we merit beatitude by obeying 
God, and in this respect we ask: "Thy will be done on earth as it is in 
heaven"; in another way instrumentally, and as it were helping us to 
merit, and in this respect we say: "Give us this day our daily bread," 
whether we understand this of the sacramental Bread, the daily use of 
which is profitable to man, and in which all the other sacraments are 
contained, or of the bread of the body, so that it denotes all 
sufficiency of food, as Augustine says (ad Probam, Ep. cxxx, 11), since 
the Eucharist is the chief sacrament, and bread is the chief food: thus 
in the Gospel of Matthew we read, "supersubstantial," i.e. "principal," 
as Jerome expounds it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] Body Para. 3/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We are directed to beatitude accidentally by the removal of obstacles. 
Now there are three obstacles to our attainment of beatitude. First, 
there is sin, which directly excludes a man from the kingdom, according 
to 1 Cor. 6:9,10, "Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, etc., shall 
possess the kingdom of God"; and to this refer the words, "Forgive us our 
trespasses." Secondly, there is temptation which hinders us from keeping 
God's will, and to this we refer when we say: "And lead us not into 
temptation," whereby we do not ask not to be tempted, but not to be 
conquered by temptation, which is to be led into temptation. Thirdly, 
there is the present penal state which is a kind of obstacle to a 
sufficiency of life, and to this we refer in the words, "Deliver us from 
evil."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 5), when we 
say, "Hallowed be Thy name, we do not mean that God's name is not holy, 
but we ask that men may treat it as a holy thing," and this pertains to 
the diffusion of God's glory among men. When we say, "Thy kingdom come, 
we do not imply that God is not reigning now," but "we excite in 
ourselves the desire for that kingdom, that it may come to us, and that 
we may reign therein," as Augustine says (ad Probam, Ep. cxxx, 11). The 
words, "Thy will be done rightly signify, 'May Thy commandments be 
obeyed' on earth as in heaven, i.e. by men as well as by angels" (De 
Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 6). Hence these three petitions will be perfectly 
fulfilled in the life to come; while the other four, according to 
Augustine (Enchiridion cxv), belong to the needs of the present life<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since prayer is the interpreter of desire, the order of the 
petitions corresponds with the order, not of execution, but of desire or 
intention, where the end precedes the things that are directed to the 
end, and attainment of good precedes removal of evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Augustine (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 11) adapts the seven 
petitions to the gifts and beatitudes. He says: "If it is fear God 
whereby blessed are the poor in spirit, let us ask that God's name be 
hallowed among men with a chaste fear. If it is piety whereby blessed are 
the meek, let us ask that His kingdom may come, so that we become meek 
and no longer resist Him. If it is knowledge whereby blessed are they 
that mourn, let us pray that His will be done, for thus we shall mourn no 
more. If it is fortitude whereby blessed ere they that hunger, let us 
pray that our daily bread be given to us. If it is counsel whereby 
blessed are the merciful, let us forgive the trespasses of others that 
our own may be forgiven. If it is understanding whereby blessed are the 
pure in heart, let us pray lest we have a double heart by seeking after 
worldly things which ere the occasion of our temptations. If it is wisdom 
whereby blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children 
of God, let us pray to be delivered from evil: for if we be delivered we 
shall by that very fact become the free children of God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> According to Augustine (Enchiridion cxvi), "Luke included 
not seven but five petitions in the Lord's Prayer, for by  omitting it, 
he shows that the third petition is a kind of repetition of the two that 
precede, and thus helps us to understand it"; because, to wit, the will 
of God tends chiefly to this---that we come to the knowledge of His 
holiness and to reign together with Him. Again the last petition 
mentioned by Matthew, "Deliver us from evil," is omitted by Luke, so that 
each one may know himself to be delivered from evil if he be not led into 
temptation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[9] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Prayer is offered up to God, not that we may bend Him, but 
that we may excite in ourselves the confidence to ask: which confidence 
is excited in us chiefly by the consideration of His charity in our 
regard, whereby he wills our good---wherefore we say: "Our Father"; and 
of His excellence, whereby He is able to fulfil it---wherefore we say: 
"Who art in heaven."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether prayer is proper to the rational creature?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prayer is not proper to the rational creature. 
Asking and receiving apparently belong to the same subject. But receiving 
is becoming also to uncreated Persons, viz. the Son and Holy Ghost. 
Therefore it is competent to them to pray: for the Son said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++14:16">Jn. 14:16</a>): 
"I will ask My [Vulg.: 'the'] Father," and the Apostle says of the Holy 
Ghost (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8:26">Rm. 8:26</a>): "The Spirit . . . asketh for us."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Angels are above rational creatures, since they are intellectual 
substances. Now prayer is becoming to the angels, wherefore we read in 
the Ps. 96:7: "Adore Him, all you His angels." Therefore prayer is not 
proper to the rational creature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same subject is fitted to pray as is fitted to call 
upon God, since this consists chiefly in prayer. But dumb animals are 
fitted to call upon God, according to Ps. 146:9, "Who giveth to beasts 
their food and to the young ravens that call upon Him." Therefore prayer 
is not proper to the rational creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Prayer is an act of reason, as stated above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But 
the rational creature is so called from his reason. Therefore prayer is 
proper to the rational creature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[10] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) prayer is an act of reason, and 
consists in beseeching a superior; just as command is an act of reason, 
whereby an inferior is directed to something. Accordingly prayer is 
properly competent to one to whom it is competent to have reason, and a 
superior whom he may beseech. Now nothing is above the Divine Persons; 
and dumb animals are devoid of reason. Therefore prayer is unbecoming 
both the Divine Persons and dumb animals, and it is proper to the 
rational creature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Receiving belongs to the Divine Persons in respect of their 
nature, whereas prayer belongs to one who receives through grace. The Son 
is said to ask or pray in respect of His  assumed, i.e. His human, nature 
and not in respect of His Godhead: and the Holy Ghost is said to ask, 
because He makes us ask.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated in the FP, Question [79], Article [8], intellect and reason are 
not distinct powers in us: but they differ as the perfect from the 
imperfect. Hence intellectual creatures which are the angels are distinct 
from rational creatures, and sometimes are included under them. In this 
sense prayer is said to be proper to the rational creature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[10] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The young ravens are said to call upon God, on account of 
the natural desire whereby all things, each in its own way, desire to 
attain the Divine goodness. Thus too dumb animals are said to obey God, 
on account of the natural instinct whereby they are moved by God.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[11] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the saints in heaven do not pray for us. A 
man's action is more meritorious for himself than for others. But the 
saints in heaven do not merit for themselves, neither do they pray for 
themselves, since they are already established in the term. Neither 
therefore do they pray for us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[11] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the saints conform their will to God perfectly, so that 
they will only what God wills. Now what God wills is always fulfilled. 
Therefore it would be useless for the saints to pray for us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[11] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the saints in heaven are above, so are those in 
Purgatory, for they can no longer sin. Now those in Purgatory do not pray 
for us, on the contrary we pray for them. Therefore neither do the saints 
in heaven pray for us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[11] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if the saints in heaven pray for us, the prayers of the 
higher saints would be more efficacious; and so we ought not to implore 
the help of the lower saints' prayers but only of those of the higher 
saints.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[11] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the soul of Peter is not Peter. If therefore the souls 
of the saints pray for us, so long as they are separated from their 
bodies, we ought not to call upon Saint Peter, but on his soul, to pray 
for us: yet the Church does the contrary. The saints therefore do not 
pray for us, at least before the resurrection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[11] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (2 Macc. 15:14): "This is . . . he that 
prayeth much for the people, and for all the holy city, Jeremias the 
prophet of God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[11] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Jerome says (Cont. Vigilant. 6), the error of 
Vigilantius consisted in saying that "while we live, we can pray one for 
another; but that after we are dead, none of our prayers  for others can 
be heard, seeing that not even the martyrs' prayers are granted when they 
pray for their blood to be avenged." But this is absolutely false, 
because, since prayers offered for others proceed from charity, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83ATHEP1">Articles [7]</a>,8), the greater the charity of the saints in heaven, the 
more they pray for wayfarers, since the latter can be helped by prayers: 
and the more closely they are united to God, the more are their prayers 
efficacious: for the Divine order is such that lower beings receive an 
overflow of the excellence of the higher, even as the air receives the 
brightness of the sun. Wherefore it is said of Christ (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++7:25">Heb. 7:25</a>): "Going 
to God by His own power . . . to make intercession for us" [*Vulg.: 'He 
is able to save for ever them that come to God by Him, always living to 
make intercession for us.']. Hence Jerome says (Cont. Vigilant. 6): "If 
the apostles and martyrs while yet in the body and having to be 
solicitous for themselves, can pray for others, how much more now that 
they have the crown of victory and triumph."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[11] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The saints in heaven, since they are blessed, have no lack 
of bliss, save that of the body's glory, and for this they pray. But they 
pray for us who lack the ultimate perfection of bliss: and their prayers 
are efficacious in impetrating through their previous merits and through 
God's acceptance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[11] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The saints impetrate what ever God wishes to take place 
through their prayers: and they pray for that which they deem will be 
granted through their prayers according to God's will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[11] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who are in Purgatory though they are above us on 
account of their impeccability, yet they are below us as to the pains 
which they suffer: and in this respect they are not in a condition to 
pray, but rather in a condition that requires us to pray for them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[11] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> It is God's will that inferior beings should be helped by 
all those that are above them, wherefore we ought to pray not only to the 
higher but also to the lower saints; else we should have to implore the 
mercy of God alone. Nevertheless it happens sometime that prayers 
addressed to a saint of lower degree are more efficacious, either because 
he is implored with greater devotion, or because God wishes to make known 
his sanctity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[11] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> It is because the saints while living merited to pray for 
us, that we invoke them under the names by which they were known in this 
life, and by which they are better known to us: and also in order to 
indicate our belief in the resurrection, according to the saying of Ex. 
3:6, "I am the God of Abraham," etc.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[12] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prayer ought not to be vocal. As stated above 
(<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), prayer is addressed chiefly to God. Now God knows the language of 
the heart. Therefore it is useless to employ  vocal prayer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[12] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prayer should lift man's mind to God, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2). But words, like other sensible objects, prevent man from 
ascending to God by contemplation. Therefore we should not use words in 
our prayers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[12] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, prayer should be offered to God in secret, according to 
Mt. 6:6, "But thou, when thou shalt pray, enter into thy chamber, and 
having shut the door, pray to thy Father in secret." But prayer loses its 
secrecy by being expressed vocally. Therefore prayer should not be vocal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[12] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++141:2">Ps. 141:2</a>): "I cried to the Lord with my 
voice, with my voice I made supplication to the Lord."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[12] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Prayer is twofold, common and individual. Common prayer 
is that which is offered to God by the ministers of the Church 
representing the body of the faithful: wherefore such like prayer should 
come to the knowledge of the whole people for whom it is offered: and 
this would not be possible unless it were vocal prayer. Therefore it is 
reasonably ordained that the ministers of the Church should say these 
prayers even in a loud voice, so that they may come to the knowledge of 
all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[12] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand individual prayer is that which is offered by any 
single person, whether he pray for himself or for others; and it is not 
essential to such a prayer as this that it be vocal. And yet the voice is 
employed in such like prayers for three reasons. First, in order to 
excite interior devotion, whereby the mind of the person praying is 
raised to God, because by means of external signs, whether of words or of 
deeds, the human mind is moved as regards apprehension, and consequently 
also as regards the affections. Hence Augustine says (ad Probam. Ep. 
cxxx, 9) that "by means of words and other signs we arouse ourselves more 
effectively to an increase of holy desires." Hence then alone should we 
use words and such like signs when they help to excite the mind 
internally. But if they distract or in any way impede the mind we should 
abstain from them; and this happens chiefly to those whose mind is 
sufficiently prepared for devotion without having recourse to those 
signs. Wherefore the Psalmist (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++26:8">Ps. 26:8</a>) said: "My heart hath said to 
Thee: 'My face hath sought Thee,'" and we read of Anna (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Sam++1:13">1 Kgs. 1:13</a>) that 
"she spoke in her heart." Secondly, the voice is used in praying as 
though to pay a debt, so that man may serve God with all that he has from 
God, that is to say, not only with his mind, but also with his body: and 
this applies to prayer considered especially as satisfactory. Hence it is 
written (Osee 14:3): "Take away all iniquity, and receive the good: and 
we will render the calves of our lips." Thirdly, we have recourse to 
vocal prayer, through a certain overflow from the soul into the body, 
through excess of feeling, according to Ps. 15:9, "My heart hath been 
glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[12] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Vocal prayer is employed, not in order to tell  God 
something He does not know, but in order to lift up the mind of the 
person praying or of other persons to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[12] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Words about other matters distract the mind and hinder the 
devotion of those who pray: but words signifying some object of devotion 
lift up the mind, especially one that is less devout.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[12] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Chrysostom says [*Hom. xiii in the Opus Imperfectum 
falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom], "Our Lord forbids one to pray 
in presence of others in order that one may be seen by others. Hence when 
you pray, do nothing strange to draw men's attention, either by shouting 
so as to be heard by others, or by openly striking the heart, or 
extending the hands, so as to be seen by many. And yet, "according to 
Augustine (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 3), "it is not wrong to be seen by 
men, but to do this or that in order to be seen by men."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether attention is a necessary condition of prayer?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[13] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that attention is a necessary condition of prayer. 
It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++4:24">Jn. 4:24</a>): "God is a spirit, and they that adore Him must 
adore Him in spirit and in truth." But prayer is not in spirit unless it 
be attentive. Therefore attention is a necessary condition of prayer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[13] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prayer is "the ascent of the mind to God" [*Damascene, 
De Fide Orth. iii, 24]. But the mind does not ascend to God if the prayer 
is inattentive. Therefore attention is a necessary condition of prayer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[13] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is a necessary condition of prayer that it should be 
altogether sinless. Now if a man allows his mind to wander while praying 
he is not free of sin, for he seems to make light of God; even as if he 
were to speak to another man without attending to what he was saying. 
Hence Basil says [*De Constit. Monach. i] that the "Divine assistance is 
to be implored, not lightly, nor with a mind wandering hither and 
thither: because he that prays thus not only will not obtain what he 
asks, nay rather will he provoke God to anger." Therefore it would seem a 
necessary condition of prayer that it should be attentive.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[13] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Even holy men sometimes suffer from a wandering of the 
mind when they pray, according to Ps. 39:13, "My heart hath forsaken me."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[13] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> This question applies chiefly to vocal prayer. 
Accordingly we must observe that a thing is necessary in two ways. First, 
a thing is necessary because thereby the end is better obtained: and thus 
attention is absolutely necessary for prayer. Secondly, a thing is said 
to be necessary when without it something cannot obtain its effect. Now 
the effect of prayer is threefold. The first is an effect which is common 
to all acts quickened by  charity, and this is merit. In order to realize 
this effect, it is not necessary that prayer should be attentive 
throughout; because the force of the original intention with which one 
sets about praying renders the whole prayer meritorious, as is the case 
with other meritorious acts. The second effect of prayer is proper 
thereto, and consists in impetration: and again the original intention, 
to which God looks chiefly, suffices to obtain this effect. But if the 
original intention is lacking, prayer lacks both merit and impetration: 
because, as Gregory [*Hugh St. Victor, Expos. in Reg. S. Aug. iii] says, 
"God hears not the prayer of those who pay no attention to their prayer." 
The third effect of prayer is that which it produces at once; this is the 
spiritual refreshment of the mind, and for this effect attention is a 
necessary condition: wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++14:14">1 Cor. 14:14</a>): "If I pray 
in a tongue . . . my understanding is without fruit."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[13] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be observed, however, that there are three kinds of attention 
that can be brought to vocal prayer: one which attends to the words, lest 
we say them wrong, another which attends to the sense of the words, and a 
third, which attends to the end of prayer, namely, God, and to the thing 
we are praying for. That last kind of attention is most necessary, and 
even idiots are capable of it. Moreover this attention, whereby the mind 
is fixed on God, is sometimes so strong that the mind forgets all other 
things, as Hugh of St. Victor states [*De Modo Orandi ii].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[13] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To pray in spirit and in truth is to set about praying 
through the instigation of the Spirit, even though afterwards the mind 
wander through weakness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[13] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The human mind is unable to remain aloft for long on 
account of the weakness of nature, because human weakness weighs down the 
soul to the level of inferior things: and hence it is that when, while 
praying, the mind ascends to God by contemplation, of a sudden it wanders 
off through weakness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[13] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Purposely to allow one's mind to wander in prayer is sinful 
and hinders the prayer from having fruit. It is against this that 
Augustine says in his Rule (Ep. ccxi): "When you pray God with psalms and 
hymns, let your mind attend to that which your lips pronounce." But to 
wander in mind unintentionally does not deprive prayer of its fruit. 
Hence Basil says (De Constit. Monach. i): "If you are so truly weakened 
by sin that you are unable to pray attentively, strive as much as you can 
to curb yourself, and God will pardon you, seeing that you are unable to 
stand in His presence in a becoming manner, not through negligence but 
through frailty."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[14] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prayer should not be continual. It is written 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++6:7">Mt. 6:7</a>): "When you are praying, speak not much." Now one who prays a 
long time needs to speak much, especially if his be  vocal prayer. 
Therefore prayer should not last a long time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[14] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prayer expresses the desire. Now a desire is all the 
holier according as it is centered on one thing, according to Ps. 26:4, 
"One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after." Therefore 
the shorter prayer is, the more is it acceptable to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[14] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it seems to be wrong to transgress the limits fixed by 
God, especially in matters concerning Divine worship, according to Ex. 
19:21: "Charge the people, lest they should have a mind to pass the 
limits to see the Lord, and a very great multitude of them should 
perish." But God has fixed for us the limits of prayer by instituting the 
Lord's Prayer (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++6">Mt. 6</a>). Therefore it is not right to prolong our prayer 
beyond its limits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[14] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> On the contrary, It would seem that we ought to pray continually. 
For our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++18:1">Lk. 18:1</a>): "We ought always to pray, and not to 
faint": and it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Thess++5:17">1 Thess. 5:17</a>): "Pray without ceasing."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[14] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We may speak about prayer in two ways: first, by 
considering it in itself; secondly, by considering it in its cause. The 
not cause of prayer is the desire of charity, from which prayer ought to 
arise: and this desire ought to be in us continually, either actually or 
virtually, for the virtue of this desire remains in whatever we do out of 
charity; and we ought to "do all things to the glory of God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++10:31">1 Cor. 10:31</a>). From this point of view prayer ought to be continual: wherefore 
Augustine says (ad Probam, Ep. cxxx, 9): "Faith, hope and charity are by 
themselves a prayer of continual longing." But prayer, considered in 
itself, cannot be continual, because we have to be busy about other 
works, and, as Augustine says (ad Probam. Ep. cxxx, 9), "we pray to God 
with our lips at certain intervals and seasons, in order to admonish 
ourselves by means of such like signs, to take note of the amount of our 
progress in that desire, and to arouse ourselves more eagerly to an 
increase thereof." Now the quantity of a thing should be commensurate 
with its end, for instance the quantity of the dose should be 
commensurate with health. And so it is becoming that prayer should last 
long enough to arouse the fervor of the interior desire: and when it 
exceeds this measure, so that it cannot be continued any longer without 
causing weariness, it should be discontinued. Wherefore Augustine says 
(ad Probam. Ep. cxxx): "It is said that the brethren in Egypt make 
frequent but very short prayers, rapid ejaculations, as it were, lest 
that vigilant and erect attention which is so necessary in prayer slacken 
and languish, through the strain being prolonged. By so doing they make 
it sufficiently clear not only that this attention must not be forced if 
we are unable to keep it up, but also that if we are able to continue, it 
should not be broken off too soon." And just as we must judge of this in 
private prayers by considering the attention of the person praying, so 
too, in public prayers we must judge of it by considering the devotion of 
the people.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[14] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (ad Probam. Ep. cxxx), "to pray with many 
words is not the same as to pray long; to speak long is one thing, to be 
devout long is another. For it is written that our Lord passed the whole 
night in prayer, and that He 'prayed the longer' in order to set us an 
example." Further on he says: "When praying say little, yet pray much so 
long as your attention is fervent. For to say much in prayer is to 
discuss your need in too many words: whereas to pray much is to knock at 
the door of Him we pray, by the continuous and devout clamor of the 
heart. Indeed this business is frequently done with groans rather than 
with words, with tears rather than with speech."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[14] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Length of prayer consists, not in praying for many things, 
but in the affections persisting in the desire of one thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[14] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Our Lord instituted this prayer, not that we might use no 
other words when we pray, but that in our prayers we might have none but 
these things in view, no matter how we express them or think of them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[14] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> One may pray continually, either through having a continual 
desire, as stated above; or through praying at certain fixed times, 
though interruptedly; or by reason of the effect, whether in the person 
who prays---because he remains more devout even after praying, or in some 
other person---as when by his kindness a man incites another to pray for 
him, even after he himself has ceased praying.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether prayer is meritorious?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[15] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prayer is not meritorious. All merit proceeds 
from grace. But prayer precedes grace, since even grace is obtained by 
means of prayer according to Lk. 11:13, "(How much more) will your Father 
from heaven give the good Spirit to them that ask Him!" Therefore prayer 
is not a meritorious act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[15] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if prayer merits anything, this would seem to be chiefly 
that which is besought in prayer. Yet it does not always merit this, 
because even the saints' prayers are frequently not heard; thus Paul was 
not heard when he besought the sting of the flesh to be removed from him. 
Therefore prayer is not a meritorious act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[15] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, prayer is based chiefly on faith, according to James 
1:6, "But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering." Now faith is not 
sufficient for merit, as instanced in those who have lifeless faith. 
Therefore prayer is not a meritorious act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[15] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on the words of Ps. 34:13, "My prayer shall be 
turned into my bosom," explains them as meaning, "if my prayer does not 
profit them, yet shall not I be deprived of my reward." Now reward is not 
due save to merit. Therefore prayer is  meritorious.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[15] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A13THEP1">Article [13]</a>) prayer, besides causing spiritual 
consolation at the time of praying, has a twofold efficacy in respect of 
a future effect, namely, efficacy in meriting and efficacy in 
impetrating. Now prayer, like any other virtuous act, is efficacious in 
meriting, because it proceeds from charity as its root, the proper object 
of which is the eternal good that we merit to enjoy. Yet prayer proceeds 
from charity through the medium of religion, of which prayer is an act, 
as stated above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), and with the concurrence of other virtues 
requisite for the goodness of prayer, viz. humility and faith. For the 
offering of prayer itself to God belongs to religion, while the desire 
for the thing. that we pray to be accomplished belongs to charity. Faith 
is necessary in reference to God to Whom we pray; that is, we need to 
believe that we can obtain from Him what we seek. Humility is necessary 
on the part of the person praying, because he recognizes his neediness. 
Devotion too is necessary: but this belongs to religion, for it is its 
first act and a necessary condition of all its secondary acts, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS082.html#SSQ82OUTP1">Question [82]</a>, <A Href="SS082.html#SSQ82ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[15] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to its efficacy in impetrating, prayer derives this from the grace of 
God to Whom we pray, and Who instigates us to pray. Wherefore Augustine 
says (De Verb. Dom., Serm. cv, 1): "He would not urge us to ask, unless 
He were willing to give"; and Chrysostom [*Cf. Catena Aurea of St. Thomas 
on Lk. 18. The words as quoted are not to be found in the words of 
Chrysostom] says: "He never refuses to grant our prayers, since in His 
loving-kindness He urged us not to faint in praying."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[15] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Neither prayer nor any other virtuous act is meritorious 
without sanctifying grace. And yet even that prayer which impetrates 
sanctifying grace proceeds from some grace, as from a gratuitous gift, 
since the very act of praying is "a gift of God," as Augustine states (De 
Persever. xxiii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[15] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sometimes the merit of prayer regards chiefly something 
distinct from the object of one's petition. For the chief object of merit 
is beatitude, whereas the direct object of the petition of prayer extends 
sometimes to certain other things, as stated above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83ATHEP1">Articles [6]</a>,7). Accordingly 
if this other thing that we ask for ourselves be not useful for our 
beatitude, we do not merit it; and sometimes by asking for and desiring 
such things we lose merit for instance if we ask of God the 
accomplishment of some sin, which would be an impious prayer. And 
sometimes it is not necessary for salvation, nor yet manifestly contrary 
thereto; and then although he who prays may merit eternal life by 
praying, yet he does not merit to obtain what he asks for. Hence 
Augustine says (Liber. Sentent. Prosperi sent. ccxii): "He who faithfully 
prays God for the necessaries of this life, is both mercifully heard, and 
mercifully not heard. For the physician knows better than the sick man 
what is good for the disease." For this reason, too, Paul was not heard 
when he prayed for the removal of the sting in his flesh, because this 
was not expedient. If, however, we pray for something  that is useful for 
our beatitude, through being conducive to salvation, we merit it not only 
by praying, but also by doing other good deeds: therefore without any 
doubt we receive what we ask for, yet when we ought to receive it: "since 
certain things are not denied us, but are deferred that they may be 
granted at a suitable time," according to Augustine (Tract. cii in 
Joan.): and again this may be hindered if we persevere not in asking for 
it. Wherefore Basil says (De Constit. Monast. i): "The reason why 
sometimes thou hast asked and not received, is because thou hast asked 
amiss, either inconsistently, or lightly, or because thou hast asked for 
what was not good for thee, or because thou hast ceased asking." Since, 
however, a man cannot condignly merit eternal life for another, as stated 
above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114OUTP1">Question [114]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), it follows that sometimes one cannot condignly 
merit for another things that pertain to eternal life. For this reason we 
are not always heard when we pray for others, as stated above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>, ad 2,3). Hence it is that four conditions are laid down; namely, to 
ask---"for ourselves---things necessary for 
salvation---piously---perseveringly"; when all these four concur, we 
always obtain what we ask for.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Prayer depends chiefly on faith, not for its efficacy in 
meriting, because thus it depends chiefly on charity, but for its 
efficacy in impetrating, because it is through faith that man comes to 
know of God's omnipotence and mercy, which are the source whence prayer 
impetrates what it asks for.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether sinners impetrate anything from God by their prayers?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[16] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sinners impetrate nothing from God by their 
prayers. It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++9:31">Jn. 9:31</a>): "We know that God doth not hear 
sinners"; and this agrees with the saying of Prov. 28:9, "He that turneth 
away his ears from hearing the law, his prayer shall be an abomination." 
Now an abominable prayer impetrates nothing from God. Therefore sinners 
impetrate nothing from God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[16] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the just impetrate from God what they merit, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A15THEP1">Article [15]</a>, ad 2). But sinners cannot merit anything since they lack 
grace and charity which is the "power of godliness," according to a gloss 
on 2 Tim. 3:5, "Having an appearance indeed of godliness, but denying the 
power thereof." and so their prayer is impious, and yet piety it required 
in order that prayer may be impetrative, as stated above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A15THEP1">Article [15]</a>, ad 2). 
Therefore sinners impetrate nothing by their prayers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[16] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Chrysostom [*Hom. xiv in the Opus Imperfectum falsely 
ascribed to St. John Chrysostom] says: "The Father is unwilling to hear 
the prayer which the Son has not inspired." Now in the prayer inspired by 
Christ we say: "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that 
trespass against us": and sinners do not fulfil this. Therefore either 
they lie in saying this, and so are unworthy to be heard, or, if they do 
not say it, they are not heard, because they do not observe the form of 
prayer instituted by Christ. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[16] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Tract. xliv, super Joan.): "If God were 
not to hear sinners, the publican would have vainly said: Lord, be 
merciful to me a sinner"; and Chrysostom [*Hom. xviii of the same Opus 
Imperfectum] says: "Everyone that asketh shall receive, that is to say 
whether he be righteous or sinful."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[16] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In the sinner, two things are to be considered: his 
nature which God loves, and the sin which He hates. Accordingly when a 
sinner prays for something as sinner, i.e. in accordance with a sinful 
desire, God hears him not through mercy but sometimes through vengeance 
when He allows the sinner to fall yet deeper into sin. For "God refuses 
in mercy what He grants in anger," as Augustine declares (Tract. lxxiii 
in Joan.). On the other hand God hears the sinner's prayer if it proceed 
from a good natural desire, not out of justice, because the sinner does 
not merit to be heard, but out of pure mercy [*Cf. Article [15], ad 1], provided 
however he fulfil the four conditions given above, namely, that he 
beseech for himself things necessary for salvation, piously and 
perseveringly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[16] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine states (Tract. xliv super Joan.), these words 
were spoken by the blind man before being anointed, i.e. perfectly 
enlightened, and consequently lack authority. And yet there is truth in 
the saying if it refers to a sinner as such, in which sense also the 
sinner's prayer is said to be an abomination.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[16] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There can be no godliness in the sinner's prayer as though 
his prayer were quickened by a habit of virtue: and yet his prayer may be 
godly in so far as he asks for something pertaining to godliness. Even so 
a man who has not the habit of justice is able to will something just, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS059.html#SSQ59OUTP1">Question [59]</a>, <A Href="SS059.html#SSQ59A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). And though his prayer is not meritorious, it 
can be impetrative, because merit depends on justice, whereas impetration 
rests on grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[16] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>, ad 1) the Lord's Prayer is 
pronounced in the common person of the whole Church: and so if anyone say 
the Lord's Prayer while unwilling to forgive his neighbor's trespasses, 
he lies not, although his words do not apply to him personally: for they 
are true as referred to the person of the Church, from which he is 
excluded by merit, and consequently he is deprived of the fruit of his 
prayer. Sometimes, however, a sinner is prepared to forgive those who 
have trespassed against him, wherefore his prayers are heard, according 
to Ecclus. 28:2, "Forgive thy neighbor if he hath hurt thee, and then 
shall thy sins be forgiven to thee when thou prayest."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the parts of prayer are fittingly described as supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[17] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the parts of prayer are unfittingly described 
as supplications, prayers, intercessions, and  thanksgivings. 
Supplication would seem to be a kind of adjuration. Yet, according to 
Origen (Super Matth. Tract. xxxv), "a man who wishes to live according to 
the gospel need not adjure another, for if it be unlawful to swear, it is 
also unlawful to adjure." Therefore supplication is unfittingly reckoned 
a part of prayer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[17] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Damascene (De Fide Orth. iii, 24), "to pray 
is to ask becoming things of God." Therefore it is unfitting to 
distinguish "prayers" from "intercessions."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[17] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, thanksgivings regard the past, while the others regard 
the future. But the past precedes the future. Therefore thanksgivings are 
unfittingly placed after the others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[17] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> suffices the authority of the Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++2:1">1 Tim. 2:1</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[17] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Three conditions are requisite for prayer. First, that 
the person who prays should approach God Whom he prays: this is signified 
in the word "prayer," because prayer is "the raising up of one's mind to 
God." The second is that there should be a petition, and this is 
signified in the word "intercession." In this case sometimes one asks for 
something definite, and then some say it is "intercession" properly so 
called, or we may ask for some thing indefinitely, for instance to be 
helped by God, or we may simply indicate a fact, as in Jn. 11:3, "Behold, 
he whom Thou lovest is sick," and then they call it "insinuation." The 
third condition is the reason for impetrating what we ask for: and this 
either on the part of God, or on the part of the person who asks. The 
reason of impetration on the part of God is His sanctity, on account of 
which we ask to be heard, according to Dan. 9:17,18, "For Thy own sake, 
incline, O God, Thy ear"; and to this pertains "supplication" 
[obsecratio] which means a pleading through sacred things, as when we 
say, "Through Thy nativity, deliver us, O Lord." The reason for 
impetration on the part of the person who asks is "thanksgiving"; since 
"through giving thanks for benefits received we merit to receive yet 
greater benefits," as we say in the collect [*Ember Friday in September 
and Postcommunion of the common of a Confessor Bishop]. Hence a gloss on 
1 Tim. 2:1 says that "in the Mass, the consecration is preceded by 
supplication," in which certain sacred things are called to mind; that 
"prayers are in the consecration itself," in which especially the mind 
should be raised up to God; and that "intercessions are in the petitions 
that follow, and thanksgivings at the end."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[17] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We may notice these four things in several of the Church's collects. 
Thus in the collect of Trinity Sunday the words, "Almighty eternal God" 
belong to the offering up of prayer to God; the words, "Who hast given to 
Thy servants," etc. belong to thanksgiving; the words, "grant, we beseech 
Thee," belong to intercession; and the words at the end, "Through Our 
Lord," etc. belong to supplication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[17] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the "Conferences of the Fathers" (ix, cap. 11, seqq.) we  read: 
"Supplication is bewailing one's sins; prayer is vowing something to God; 
intercession is praying for others; thanksgiving is offered by the mind 
to God in ineffable ecstasy." The first explanation, however, is the 
better.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[17] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> "Supplication" is an adjuration not for the purpose of 
compelling, for this is forbidden, but in order to implore mercy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[17] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> "Prayer" in the general sense includes all the things 
mentioned here; but when distinguished from the others it denotes 
properly the ascent to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[83] A[17] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Among things that are diverse the past precedes the future; 
but the one and same thing is future before it is past. Hence 
thanksgiving for other benefits precedes intercession: but one and the 
same benefit is first sought, and finally, when it has been received, we 
give thanks for it. Intercession is preceded by prayer whereby we 
approach Him of Whom we ask: and prayer is preceded by supplication, 
whereby through the consideration of God's goodness we dare approach Him.<br>
