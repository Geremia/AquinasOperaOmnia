  <h3 align="left">Whether prayer is an act of the appetitive power?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prayer is an act of the
    appetitive power. It belongs to prayer to be heard. Now it is the desire
    that is heard by God, according to Ps. 9:38, "The Lord hath heard the desire
    of the poor." Therefore prayer is desire. But desire is an act of the
    appetitive power: and therefore prayer is also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iii): "It is
    useful to begin everything with prayer, because thereby we surrender
    ourselves to God and unite ourselves to Him." Now union with God is effected
    by love which belongs to the appetitive power. Therefore prayer belongs to
    the appetitive power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher states (De Anima iii, 6)
    that there are two operations of the intellective part. Of these the first
    is "the understanding of indivisibles," by which operation we apprehend what
    a thing is: while the second is "synthesis" and "analysis," whereby we
    apprehend that a thing is or is not. To these a third may be added, namely,
    "reasoning," whereby we proceed from the known to the unknown. Now prayer is
    not reducible to any of these operations. Therefore it is an operation, not
    of the intellective, but of the appetitive power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says (Etym. x) that "to pray is to
    speak." Now speech belongs to the intellect. Therefore prayer is an act, not
    of the appetitive, but of the intellective power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to Cassiodorus [*Comment. in Ps.
    38:13] "prayer [oratio] is spoken reason [oris ratio]." Now the speculative
    and practical reason differ in this, that the speculative merely apprehends
    its object, whereas the practical reason not only apprehends but causes. Now
    one thing is the cause of another in two ways: first perfectly, when it
    necessitates its effect, and this happens when the effect is wholly subject
    to the power of the cause; secondly imperfectly, by merely disposing to the
    effect, for the reason that the effect is not wholly subject to the power of
    the cause. Accordingly in this way the reason is cause of certain things in
    two ways: first, by imposing necessity; and in this way it belongs to
    reason, to command not only the lower powers and the members of the body,
    but also human subjects, which indeed is done by commanding; secondly, by
    leading up to the effect, and, in a way, disposing to it, and in this sense
    the reason asks for something to be done by things not subject to it,
    whether they be its equals or its superiors. Now both of these, namely, to
    command and to ask or beseech, imply a certain ordering, seeing that man
    proposes something to be effected by something else, wherefore they pertain
    to the reason to which it belongs to set in order. For this reason the
    Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 13) that the "reason exhorts us to do what is
    best."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now in the present instance we are speaking of prayer [*This last paragraph
    refers to the Latin word 'oratio' [prayer] which originally signified a
    speech, being derived in the first instance from 'os,' 'oris' (the mouth).]
    as signifying a beseeching or petition, in which sense Augustine [*Rabanus,
    De Univ. vi, 14]: says (De Verb. Dom.) that "prayer is a petition," and
    Damascene states (De Fide Orth. iii, 24) that "to pray is to ask becoming
    things of God." Accordingly it is evident that prayer, as we speak of it
    now, is an act of reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Lord is said to hear the desire of
    the poor, either because desire is the cause of their petition, since a
    petition is like the interpreter of a desire, or in order to show how
    speedily they are heard, since no sooner do the poor desire something than
    God hears them before they put up a prayer, according to the saying of Is.
    65:24, "And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will hear."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FP.html"
      >FP</a
    >, <a href="../FP/FP082.html#FPQ82OUTP1">Question [82]</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP082.html#FPQ82A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3), the will
    moves the reason to its end: wherefore nothing hinders the act of reason,
    under the motion of the will, from tending to an end such as charity which
    is union with God. Now prayer tends to God through being moved by the will
    of charity, as it were, and this in two ways. First, on the part of the
    object of our petition, because when we pray we ought principally to ask to
    be united to God, according to Ps. 26:4, "One thing I have asked of the
    Lord, this will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
    the days of my life." Secondly, on the part of the petitioner, who ought to
    approach the person whom he petitions, either locally, as when he petitions
    a man, or mentally, as when he petitions God. Hence Dionysius says (Div.
    Nom. iii) that "when we call upon God in our prayers, we unveil our mind in
    His presence": and in the same sense Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 24)
    that "prayer is the raising up of the mind to God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> These three acts belong to the
    speculative reason, but to the practical reason it belongs in addition to
    cause something by way of command or of petition, as stated above.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether it is becoming to pray?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is unbecoming to pray.
    Prayer seems to be necessary in order that we may make our needs known to
    the person to whom we pray. But according to Mt. 6:32, "Your Father knoweth
    that you have need of all these things." Therefore it is not becoming to
    pray to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by prayer we bend the mind of the person
    to whom we pray, so that he may do what is asked of him. But God's mind is
    unchangeable and inflexible, according to 1 Kgs. 15:29, "But the Triumpher
    in Israel will not spare, and will not be moved to repentance." Therefore it
    is not fitting that we should pray to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is more liberal to give to one that
    asks not, than to one who asks because, according to Seneca (De Benefic. ii,
    1), "nothing is bought more dearly than what is bought with prayers." But
    God is supremely liberal. Therefore it would seem unbecoming to pray to
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++18%3A1"
      >Lk. 18:1</a
    >): "We ought always to pray, and not to faint."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Among the ancients there was a threefold error
    concerning prayer. Some held that human affairs are not ruled by Divine
    providence; whence it would follow that it is useless to pray and to worship
    God at all: of these it is written (Malach. 3:14): "You have said: He
    laboreth in vain that serveth God." Another opinion held that all things,
    even in human affairs, happen of necessity, whether by reason of the
    unchangeableness of Divine providence, or through the compelling influence
    of the stars, or on account of the connection of causes: and this opinion
    also excluded the utility of prayer. There was a third opinion of those who
    held that human affairs are indeed ruled by Divine providence, and that they
    do not happen of necessity; yet they deemed the disposition of Divine
    providence to be changeable, and that it is changed by prayers and other
    things pertaining to the worship of God. All these opinions were disproved
    in the FP, Question [19], Articles [7],8; FP, Question [22], Articles [2],4;
    FP, Question [115], Article [6]; FP, Question [116]. Wherefore it behooves
    us so to account for the utility of prayer as neither to impose necessity on
    human affairs subject to Divine providence, nor to imply changeableness on
    the part of the Divine disposition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to throw light on this question we must consider that Divine
    providence disposes not only what effects shall take place, but also from
    what causes and in what order these effects shall proceed. Now among other
    causes human acts are the causes of certain effects. Wherefore it must be
    that men do certain actions. not that thereby they may change the Divine
    disposition, but that by those actions they may achieve certain effects
    according to the order of the Divine disposition: and the same is to be said
    of natural causes. And so is it with regard to prayer. For we pray not that
    we may change the Divine disposition, but that we may impetrate that which
    God has disposed to be fulfilled by our prayers in other words "that by
    asking, men may deserve to receive what Almighty God from eternity has
    disposed to give," as Gregory says (Dial. i, 8)<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We need to pray to God, not in order to
    make known to Him our needs or desires but that we ourselves may be reminded
    of the necessity of having recourse to God's help in these matters.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above, our motive in praying
    is, not Divine disposition, we may change the Divine disposition, but that,
    by our prayers, we may obtain what God has appointed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God bestows many things on us out of His
    liberality, even without our asking for them: but that He wishes to bestow
    certain things on us at our asking, is for the sake of our good, namely,
    that we may acquire confidence in having recourse to God, and that we may
    recognize in Him the Author of our goods. Hence Chrysostom says [*Implicitly
    [Hom. ii, de Orat.: Hom. xxx in Genes. ]; Cf. Caten. Aur. on Lk. 18]: "Think
    what happiness is granted thee, what honor bestowed on thee, when thou
    conversest with God in prayer, when thou talkest with Christ, when thou
    askest what thou wilt, whatever thou desirest."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether prayer is an act of religion?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prayer is not an act of
    religion. Since religion is a part of justice, it resides in the will as in
    its subject. But prayer belongs to the intellective part, as stated above
    (<a href="SS083.html#SSQ83A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore prayer seems
    to be an act, not of religion, but of the gift of understanding whereby the
    mind ascends to God.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the act of "latria" falls under a
    necessity of precept. But prayer does not seem to come under a necessity of
    precept, but to come from the mere will, since it is nothing else than a
    petition for what we will. Therefore prayer seemingly is not an act of
    religion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it seems to belong to religion that one
    "offers worship end ceremonial rites to the Godhead" [*Cicero, Rhet. ii,
    53]. But prayer seems not to offer anything to God, but to. ask to obtain
    something from Him. Therefore prayer is not an act of religion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++140%3A2"
      >Ps. 140:2</a
    >): "Let my prayer be directed as incense in Thy sight": and a gloss on the
    passage says that "it was to signify this that under the old Law incense was
    said to be offered for a sweet smell to the Lord." Now this belongs to
    religion. Therefore prayer is an act of religion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS081.html#SSQ81OUTP1"
      >Question [81]</a
    >, <a href="SS081.html#SSQ81ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4), it belongs properly
    to religion to show honor to God, wherefore all those things through which
    reverence is shown to God, belong to religion. Now man shows reverence to
    God by means of prayer, in so far as he subjects himself to Him, and by
    praying confesses that he needs Him as the Author of his goods. Hence it is
    evident that prayer is properly an act of religion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The will moves the other powers of the
    soul to its end, as stated above (<a href="SS082.html#SSQ82OUTP1"
      >Question [82]</a
    >, <a href="SS082.html#SSQ82A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), and therefore
    religion, which is in the will, directs the acts of the other powers to the
    reverence of God. Now among the other powers of the soul the intellect is
    the highest, and the nearest to the will; and consequently after devotion
    which belongs to the will, prayer which belongs to the intellective part is
    the chief of the acts of religion, since by it religion directs man's
    intellect to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is a matter of precept not only that
    we should ask for what we desire, but also that we should desire aright. But
    to desire comes under a precept of charity, whereas to ask comes under a
    precept of religion, which precept is expressed in Mt. 7:7, where it is
    said: "Ask and ye shall receive" [*Vulg.: 'Ask and it shall be given
    you.'].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> By praying man surrenders his mind to
    God, since he subjects it to Him with reverence and, so to speak, presents
    it to Him, as appears from the words of Dionysius quoted above (<a
      href="SS083.html#SSQ83A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, Objection [2]). Wherefore just as the human mind excels exterior things,
    whether bodily members, or those external things that are employed for God's
    service, so too, prayer surpasses other acts of religion.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether we ought to pray to God alone?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought to pray to God alone.
    Prayer is an act of religion, as stated above (<a
      href="SS083.html#SSQ83A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >). But God alone is to be worshiped by religion. Therefore we should pray
    to God alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is useless to pray to one who is
    ignorant of the prayer. But it belongs to God alone to know one's prayer,
    both because frequently prayer is uttered by an interior act which God alone
    knows, rather than by words, according to the saying of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++14%3A15"
      >1 Cor. 14:15</a
    >), "I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding":
    and again because, as Augustine says (De Cura pro mortuis xiii) the "dead,
    even the saints, know not what the living, even their own children, are
    doing." Therefore we ought to pray to God alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if we pray to any of the saints, this is
    only because they are united to God. Now some yet living in this world, or
    even some who are in Purgatory, are closely united to God by grace, and yet
    we do not pray to them. Therefore neither should we pray to the saints who
    are in Paradise.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+5%3A1"
      >Job 5:1</a
    >), "Call... if there be any that will answer thee, and turn to some of the
    saints."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Prayer is offered to a person in two ways:
    first, as to be fulfilled by him, secondly, as to be obtained through him.
    In the first way we offer prayer to God alone, since all our prayers ought
    to be directed to the acquisition of grace and glory, which God alone gives,
    according to Ps. 83:12, "The Lord will give grace and glory." But in the
    second way we pray to the saints, whether angels or men, not that God may
    through them know our petitions, but that our prayers may be effective
    through their prayers and merits. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++8%3A4"
      >Apoc. 8:4</a
    >) that "the smoke of the incense," namely "the prayers of the saints
    ascended up before God." This is also clear from the very style employed by
    the Church in praying: since we beseech the Blessed Trinity "to have mercy
    on us," while we ask any of the saints "to pray for us."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To Him alone do we offer religious
    worship when praying, from Whom we seek to obtain what we pray for, because
    by so doing we confess that He is the Author of our goods: but not to those
    whom we call upon as our advocates in God's presence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The dead, if we consider their natural
    condition, do not know what takes place in this world, especially the
    interior movements of the heart. Nevertheless, according to Gregory (Moral.
    xii, 21), whatever it is fitting the blessed should know about what happens
    to us, even as regards the interior movements of the heart, is made known to
    them in the Word: and it is most becoming to their exalted position that
    they should know the petitions we make to them by word or thought; and
    consequently the petitions which we raise to them are known to them through
    Divine manifestation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who are in this world or in
    Purgatory, do not yet enjoy the vision of the Word, so as to be able to know
    what we think or say. Wherefore we do not seek their assistance by praying
    to them, but ask it of the living by speaking to them.<br />

    Whether we ought to ask for something definite when we pray?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought not to ask for
    anything definite when we pray to God. According to Damascene (De Fide Orth.
    iii, 24), "to pray is to ask becoming things of God"; wherefore it is
    useless to pray for what is inexpedient, according to James 4:3, "You ask,
    and receive not: because you ask amiss." Now according to Rm. 8:26, "we know
    not what we should pray for as we ought." Therefore we ought not to ask for
    anything definite when we pray.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those who ask another person for
    something definite strive to incline his will to do what they wish
    themselves. But we ought not to endeavor to make God will what we will; on
    the contrary, we ought to strive to will what He wills, according to a gloss
    on Ps. 32:1, "Rejoice in the Lord, O ye just." Therefore we ought not to ask
    God for anything definite when we pray.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, evil things are not to be sought from
    God; and as to good things, God Himself invites us to take them. Now it is
    useless to ask a person to give you what he invites you to take. Therefore
    we ought not to ask God for anything definite in our prayers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6+and+Lk++11"
      >Mt. 6 and Lk. 11</a
    >) taught His disciples to ask definitely for those things which are
    contained in the petitions of the Lord's Prayer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to Valerius Maximus [*Fact. et Dict.
    Memor. vii, 2], "Socrates deemed that we should ask the immortal gods for
    nothing else but that they should grant us good things, because they at any
    rate know what is good for each one whereas when we pray we frequently ask
    for what it had been better for us not to obtain." This opinion is true to a
    certain extent, as to those things which may have an evil result, and which
    man may use ill or well, such as "riches, by which," as stated by the same
    authority (Fact. et Dict. Memor. vii, 2), "many have come to an evil end;
    honors, which have ruined many; power, of which we frequently witness the
    unhappy results; splendid marriages, which sometimes bring about the total
    wreck of a family." Nevertheless there are certain goods which man cannot
    ill use, because they cannot have an evil result. Such are those which are
    the object of beatitude and whereby we merit it: and these the saints seek
    absolutely when they pray, as in Ps. 79:4, "Show us Thy face, and we shall
    be saved," and again in Ps. 118:35, "Lead me into the path of Thy
    commandments."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although man cannot by himself know what
    he ought to pray for, "the Spirit," as stated in the same passage, "helpeth
    our infirmity," since by inspiring us with holy desires, He makes us ask for
    what is right. Hence our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++4%3A24"
      >Jn. 4:24</a
    >) that true adorers "must adore... in spirit and in truth."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When in our prayers we ask for things
    concerning our salvation, we conform our will to God's, of Whom it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++2%3A4"
      >1 Tim. 2:4</a
    >) that "He will have all men to be saved."
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God so invites us to take good things,
    that we may approach to them not by the steps of the body, but by pious
    desires and devout prayers.<br />

    Whether man ought to ask God for temporal things when he prays?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man ought not to ask God for
    temporal things when he prays. We seek what we ask for in prayer. But we
    should not seek for temporal things, for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A33"
      >Mt. 6:33</a
    >): "Seek ye... first the kingdom of God, and His justice: and all these
    things shall be added unto you," that is to say, temporal things, which,
    says He, we are not to seek, but they will be added to what we seek.
    Therefore temporal things are not to be asked of God in prayer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one asks save for that which he is
    solicitous about. Now we ought not to have solicitude for temporal things,
    according to the saying of Mt. 6:25, "Be not solicitous for your life, what
    you shall eat." Therefore we ought not to ask for temporal things when we
    pray.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by prayer our mind should be raised up
    to God. But by asking for temporal things, it descends to things beneath it,
    against the saying of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++4%3A18"
      >2 Cor. 4:18</a
    >), "While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which
    are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things
    which are not seen are eternal." Therefore man ought not to ask God for
    temporal things when he prays.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, man ought not to ask of God other than
    good and useful things. But sometimes temporal things, when we have them,
    are harmful, not only in a spiritual sense, but also in a material sense.
    Therefore we should not ask God for them in our prayers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++30%3A8"
      >Prov. 30:8</a
    >): "Give me only the necessaries of life."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (ad Probam, de orando Deum,
    Ep. cxxx, 12): "It is lawful to pray for what it is lawful to desire." Now
    it is lawful to desire temporal things, not indeed principally, by placing
    our end therein, but as helps whereby we are assisted in tending towards
    beatitude, in so far, to wit, as they are the means of supporting the life
    of the body, and are of service to us as instruments in performing acts of
    virtue, as also the Philosopher states (Ethic. i, 8). Augustine too says the
    same to Proba (ad Probam, de orando Deum, Ep. cxxx, 6,7) when he states that
    "it is not unbecoming for anyone to desire enough for a livelihood, and no
    more; for this sufficiency is desired, not for its own sake, but for the
    welfare of the body, or that we should desire to be clothed in a way
    befitting one's station, so as not to be out of keeping with those among
    whom we have to live. Accordingly we ought to pray that we may keep these
    things if we have them, and if we have them not, that we may gain possession
    of them."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We should seek temporal things not in
    the first but in the second place. Hence Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in
    Monte ii, 16): "When He says that this" (i.e. the kingdom of God) "is to be
    sought first, He implies that the other" (i.e. temporal goods) "is to be
    sought afterwards, not in time but in importance, this as being our good,
    the other as our need."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Not all solicitude about temporal things
    is forbidden, but that which is superfluous and inordinate, as stated above
    (<a href="SS055.html#SSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>,
    <a href="SS055.html#SSQ55A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When our mind is intent on temporal
    things in order that it may rest in them, it remains immersed therein; but
    when it is intent on them in relation to the acquisition of beatitude, it is
    not lowered by them, but raises them to a higher level.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> From the very fact that we ask for
    temporal things not as the principal object of our petition, but as
    subordinate to something else, we ask God for them in the sense that they
    may be granted to us in so far as they are expedient for salvation.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether we ought to pray for others?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought not to pray for
    others. In praying we ought to conform to the pattern given by our Lord. Now
    in the Lord's Prayer we make petitions for ourselves, not for others; thus
    we say: "Give us this day our daily bread," etc. Therefore we should not
    pray for others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prayer is offered that it may be heard.
    Now one of the conditions required for prayer that it may be heard is that
    one pray for oneself, wherefore Augustine in commenting on Jn. 16:23, "If
    you ask the Father anything in My name He will give it you," says (Tract.
    cii): "Everyone is heard when he prays for himself, not when he prays for
    all; wherefore He does not say simply 'He will give it,' but 'He will give
    it you. '" Therefore it would seem that we ought not to pray for others, but
    only for ourselves.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we are forbidden to pray for others, if
    they are wicked, according to Jer. 7:16, "Therefore do not then pray for
    this people... and do not withstand Me, for I will not hear thee." On the
    other hand we are not bound to pray for the good, since they are heard when
    they pray for themselves. Therefore it would seem that we ought not to pray
    for others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+5%3A16"
      >James 5:16</a
    >): "Pray one for another, that you may be saved."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS083.html#SSQ83A6THEP1"
      >Article [6]</a
    >), when we pray we ought to ask for what we ought to desire. Now we ought
    to desire good things not only for ourselves, but also for others: for this
    is essential to the love which we owe to our neighbor, as stated above (<a
      href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1"
      >Question [25]</a
    >, <a href="SS025.html#SSQ25ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,12;
    <a href="SS027.html#SSQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>,
    <a href="SS027.html#SSQ27A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="SS031.html#SSQ31OUTP1">Question [31]</a>,
    <a href="SS031.html#SSQ31A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore charity
    requires us to pray for others. Hence Chrysostom says (Hom. xiv in Matth.)
    [*Opus Imperfectum, falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom]: "Necessity
    binds us to pray for ourselves, fraternal charity urges us to pray for
    others: and the prayer that fraternal charity proffers is sweeter to God
    than that which is the outcome of necessity."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Cyprian says (De orat. Dom.), "We say
    'Our Father' and not 'My Father,' 'Give us' and not 'Give me,' because the
    Master of unity did not wish us to pray privately, that is for ourselves
    alone, for He wished each one to pray for all, even as He Himself bore all
    in one."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is a condition of prayer that one
    pray for oneself: not as though it were necessary in order that prayer be
    meritorious, but as being necessary in order that prayer may not fail in its
    effect of impetration. For it sometimes happens that we pray for another
    with piety and perseverance, and ask for things relating to his salvation,
    and yet it is not granted on account of some obstacle on the part of the
    person we are praying for, according to Jer. 15:1, "If Moses and Samuel
    shall stand before Me, My soul is not towards this people." And yet the
    prayer will be meritorious for the person who prays thus out of charity,
    according to Ps. 34:13, "My prayer shall be turned into my bosom, i.e.
    though it profit them not, I am not deprived of my reward," as the gloss
    expounds it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> We ought to pray even for sinners, that
    they may be converted, and for the just that they may persevere and advance
    in holiness. Yet those who pray are heard not for all sinners but for some:
    since they are heard for the predestined, but not for those who are
    foreknown to death; even as the correction whereby we correct the brethren,
    has an effect in the predestined but not in the reprobate, according to
    Eccles. 7:14, "No man can correct whom God hath despised." Hence it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++5%3A16"
      >1 Jn. 5:16</a
    >): "He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death, let him
    ask, and life shall be given to him, who sinneth not to death." Now just as
    the benefit of correction must not be refused to any man so long as he lives
    here below, because we cannot distinguish the predestined from the
    reprobate, as Augustine says (De Correp. et Grat. xv), so too no man should
    be denied the help of prayer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We ought also to pray for the just for three reasons: First, because the
    prayers of a multitude are more easily heard, wherefore a gloss on Rm.
    15:30, "Help me in your prayers," says: "The Apostle rightly tells the
    lesser brethren to pray for him, for many lesser ones, if they be united
    together in one mind, become great, and it is impossible for the prayers of
    a multitude not to obtain" that which is possible to be obtained by prayer.
    Secondly, that many may thank God for the graces conferred on the just,
    which graces conduce to the profit of many, according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++1%3A11"
      >2 Cor. 1:11</a
    >). Thirdly, that the more perfect may not wax proud, seeing that they find
    that they need the prayers of the less perfect.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether we ought to pray for our enemies?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought not to pray for our
    enemies. According to Rm. 15:4, "what things soever were written, were
    written for our learning." Now Holy Writ contains many imprecations against
    enemies; thus it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++6%3A11"
      >Ps. 6:11</a
    >): "Let all my enemies be ashamed and be... troubled, let them be ashamed
    and be troubled very speedily [*Vulg.: 'Let them be turned back and be
    ashamed.']." Therefore we too should pray against rather than for our
    enemies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to be revenged on one's enemies is
    harmful to them. But holy men seek vengeance of their enemies according to
    Apoc. 6:10, "How long... dost Thou not... revenge our blood on them that
    dwell on earth?" Wherefore they rejoice in being revenged on their enemies,
    according to Ps. 57:11, "The just shall rejoice when he shall see the
    revenge." Therefore we should not pray for our enemies, but against them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man's deed should not be contrary to his
    prayer. Now sometimes men lawfully attack their enemies, else all wars would
    be unlawful, which is opposed to what we have said above (<a
      href="SS040.html#SSQ40OUTP1"
      >Question [40]</a
    >, <a href="SS040.html#SSQ40A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore we should
    not pray for our enemies.<br />

    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++5%3A44"
      >Mt. 5:44</a
    >): "Pray for them that persecute and calumniate you."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> To pray for another is an act of charity, as
    stated above (<a href="SS083.html#SSQ83A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Wherefore
    we are bound to pray for our enemies in the same manner as we are bound to
    love them. Now it was explained above in the treatise on charity (<a
      href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1"
      >Question [25]</a
    >, <a href="SS025.html#SSQ25ATHEP1">Articles [8]</a>,9), how we are bound to
    love our enemies, namely, that we must love in them their nature, not their
    sin. and that to love our enemies in general is a matter of precept, while
    to love them in the individual is not a matter of precept, except in the
    preparedness of the mind, so that a man must be prepared to love his enemy
    even in the individual and to help him in a case of necessity, or if his
    enemy should beg his forgiveness. But to love one's enemies absolutely in
    the individual, and to assist them, is an act of perfection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In like manner it is a matter of obligation that we should not exclude our
    enemies from the general prayers which we offer up for others: but it is a
    matter of perfection, and not of obligation, to pray for them individually,
    except in certain special cases.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The imprecations contained in Holy Writ
    may be understood in four ways. First, according to the custom of the
    prophets "to foretell the future under the veil of an imprecation," as
    Augustine states [*De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 21]. Secondly, in the sense
    that certain temporal evils are sometimes inflicted by God on the wicked for
    their correction. Thirdly, because they are understood to be pronounced, not
    against the men themselves, but against the kingdom of sin, with the
    purpose, to wit, of destroying sin by the correction of men. Fourthly, by
    way of conformity of our will to the Divine justice with regard to the
    damnation of those who are obstinate in sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine states in the same book (De
    Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 22), "the martyrs' vengeance is the overthrow of the
    kingdom of sin, because they suffered so much while it reigned": or as he
    says again (Questions. Vet. et Nov. Test. lxviii), "their prayer for
    vengeance is expressed not in words but in their minds, even as the blood of
    Abel cried from the earth." They rejoice in vengeance not for its own sake,
    but for the sake of Divine justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is lawful to attack one's enemies,
    that they may be restrained from sin: and this is for their own good and for
    the good of others. Consequently it is even lawful in praying to ask that
    temporal evils be inflicted on our enemies in order that they may mend their
    ways. Thus prayer and deed will not be contrary to one another.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the seven petitions of the Lord's Prayer are fittingly assigned?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the seven petitions of the
    Lord's Prayer are not fittingly assigned. It is useless to ask for that to
    be hallowed which is always holy. But the name of God is always holy,
    according to Lk. 1:49, "Holy is His name." Again, His kingdom is
    everlasting, according to Ps. 144:13, "Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all
    ages." Again, God's will is always fulfilled, according to Isa 46:10, "All
    My will shall be done." Therefore it is useless to ask for "the name of God
    to be hallowed," for "His kingdom to come," and for "His will to be
    done."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one must withdraw from evil before
    attaining good. Therefore it seems unfitting for the petitions relating to
    the attainment of good to be set forth before those relating to the removal
    of evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one asks for a thing that it may be
    given to one. Now the chief gift of God is the Holy Ghost, and those gifts
    that we receive through Him. Therefore the petitions seem to be unfittingly
    assigned, since they do not correspond to the gifts of the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, according to Luke, only five petitions
    are mentioned in the Lord's Prayer, as appears from the eleventh chapter.
    Therefore it was superfluous for Matthew to mention seven.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, it seems useless to seek to win the
    benevolence of one who forestalls us by his benevolence. Now God forestalls
    us by His benevolence, since "He first hath loved us" (1 Jn. 4:19).
    Therefore it is useless to preface the petitions with the words our "Father
    Who art in heaven," which seem to indicate a desire to win God's
    benevolence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The authority of Christ, who composed this
    prayer, suffices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The Lord's Prayer is most perfect, because, as
    Augustine says (ad Probam Ep. cxxx, 12), "if we pray rightly and fittingly,
    we can say nothing else but what is contained in this prayer of our Lord."
    For since prayer interprets our desires, as it were, before God, then alone
    is it right to ask for something in our prayers when it is right that we
    should desire it. Now in the Lord's Prayer not only do we ask for all that
    we may rightly desire, but also in the order wherein we ought to desire
    them, so that this prayer not only teaches us to ask, but also directs all
    our affections. Thus it is evident that the first thing to be the object of
    our desire is the end, and afterwards whatever is directed to the end. Now
    our end is God towards Whom our affections tend in two ways: first, by our
    willing the glory of God, secondly, by willing to enjoy His glory. The first
    belongs to the love whereby we love God in Himself, while the second belongs
    to the love whereby we love ourselves in God. Wherefore the first petition
    is expressed thus: "Hallowed be Thy name," and the second thus: "Thy kingdom
    come," by which we ask to come to the glory of His kingdom.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    To this same end a thing directs us in two ways: in one way, by its very
    nature, in another way, accidentally. Of its very nature the good which is
    useful for an end directs us to that end. Now a thing is useful in two ways
    to that end which is beatitude: in one way, directly and principally,
    according to the merit whereby we merit beatitude by obeying God, and in
    this respect we ask: "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven"; in
    another way instrumentally, and as it were helping us to merit, and in this
    respect we say: "Give us this day our daily bread," whether we understand
    this of the sacramental Bread, the daily use of which is profitable to man,
    and in which all the other sacraments are contained, or of the bread of the
    body, so that it denotes all sufficiency of food, as Augustine says (ad
    Probam, Ep. cxxx, 11), since the Eucharist is the chief sacrament, and bread
    is the chief food: thus in the Gospel of Matthew we read,
    "supersubstantial," i.e. "principal," as Jerome expounds it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We are directed to beatitude accidentally by the removal of obstacles. Now
    there are three obstacles to our attainment of beatitude. First, there is
    sin, which directly excludes a man from the kingdom, according to 1 Cor.
    6:9,10, "Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, etc., shall possess the kingdom
    of God"; and to this refer the words, "Forgive us our trespasses." Secondly,
    there is temptation which hinders us from keeping God's will, and to this we
    refer when we say: "And lead us not into temptation," whereby we do not ask
    not to be tempted, but not to be conquered by temptation, which is to be led
    into temptation. Thirdly, there is the present penal state which is a kind
    of obstacle to a sufficiency of life, and to this we refer in the words,
    "Deliver us from evil."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in
    Monte ii, 5), when we say, "Hallowed be Thy name, we do not mean that God's
    name is not holy, but we ask that men may treat it as a holy thing," and
    this pertains to the diffusion of God's glory among men. When we say, "Thy
    kingdom come, we do not imply that God is not reigning now," but "we excite
    in ourselves the desire for that kingdom, that it may come to us, and that
    we may reign therein," as Augustine says (ad Probam, Ep. cxxx, 11). The
    words, "Thy will be done rightly signify, 'May Thy commandments be obeyed'
    on earth as in heaven, i.e. by men as well as by angels" (De Serm. Dom. in
    Monte ii, 6). Hence these three petitions will be perfectly fulfilled in the
    life to come; while the other four, according to Augustine (Enchiridion
    cxv), belong to the needs of the present life<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since prayer is the interpreter of
    desire, the order of the petitions corresponds with the order, not of
    execution, but of desire or intention, where the end precedes the things
    that are directed to the end, and attainment of good precedes removal of
    evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Augustine (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii,
    11) adapts the seven petitions to the gifts and beatitudes. He says: "If it
    is fear God whereby blessed are the poor in spirit, let us ask that God's
    name be hallowed among men with a chaste fear. If it is piety whereby
    blessed are the meek, let us ask that His kingdom may come, so that we
    become meek and no longer resist Him. If it is knowledge whereby blessed are
    they that mourn, let us pray that His will be done, for thus we shall mourn
    no more. If it is fortitude whereby blessed ere they that hunger, let us
    pray that our daily bread be given to us. If it is counsel whereby blessed
    are the merciful, let us forgive the trespasses of others that our own may
    be forgiven. If it is understanding whereby blessed are the pure in heart,
    let us pray lest we have a double heart by seeking after worldly things
    which ere the occasion of our temptations. If it is wisdom whereby blessed
    are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God, let us
    pray to be delivered from evil: for if we be delivered we shall by that very
    fact become the free children of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> According to Augustine (Enchiridion
    cxvi), "Luke included not seven but five petitions in the Lord's Prayer, for
    by omitting it, he shows that the third petition is a kind of repetition of
    the two that precede, and thus helps us to understand it"; because, to wit,
    the will of God tends chiefly to this---that we come to the knowledge of His
    holiness and to reign together with Him. Again the last petition mentioned
    by Matthew, "Deliver us from evil," is omitted by Luke, so that each one may
    know himself to be delivered from evil if he be not led into temptation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Prayer is offered up to God, not that we
    may bend Him, but that we may excite in ourselves the confidence to ask:
    which confidence is excited in us chiefly by the consideration of His
    charity in our regard, whereby he wills our good---wherefore we say: "Our
    Father"; and of His excellence, whereby He is able to fulfil it---wherefore
    we say: "Who art in heaven."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether prayer is proper to the rational creature?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prayer is not proper to the
    rational creature. Asking and receiving apparently belong to the same
    subject. But receiving is becoming also to uncreated Persons, viz. the Son
    and Holy Ghost. Therefore it is competent to them to pray: for the Son said
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++14%3A16">Jn. 14:16</a>):
    "I will ask My [Vulg.: 'the'] Father," and the Apostle says of the Holy
    Ghost (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A26"
      >Rm. 8:26</a
    >): "The Spirit... asketh for us."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Angels are above rational creatures, since they
    are intellectual substances. Now prayer is becoming to the angels, wherefore
    we read in the Ps. 96:7: "Adore Him, all you His angels." Therefore prayer
    is not proper to the rational creature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same subject is fitted to pray as is
    fitted to call upon God, since this consists chiefly in prayer. But dumb
    animals are fitted to call upon God, according to Ps. 146:9, "Who giveth to
    beasts their food and to the young ravens that call upon Him." Therefore
    prayer is not proper to the rational creatures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Prayer is an act of reason, as stated above
    (<a href="SS083.html#SSQ83A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But the rational
    creature is so called from his reason. Therefore prayer is proper to the
    rational creature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS083.html#SSQ83A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >) prayer is an act of reason, and consists in beseeching a superior; just
    as command is an act of reason, whereby an inferior is directed to
    something. Accordingly prayer is properly competent to one to whom it is
    competent to have reason, and a superior whom he may beseech. Now nothing is
    above the Divine Persons; and dumb animals are devoid of reason. Therefore
    prayer is unbecoming both the Divine Persons and dumb animals, and it is
    proper to the rational creature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Receiving belongs to the Divine Persons
    in respect of their nature, whereas prayer belongs to one who receives
    through grace. The Son is said to ask or pray in respect of His assumed,
    i.e. His human, nature and not in respect of His Godhead: and the Holy Ghost
    is said to ask, because He makes us ask.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated in the FP, Question [79],
    Article [8], intellect and reason are not distinct powers in us: but they
    differ as the perfect from the imperfect. Hence intellectual creatures which
    are the angels are distinct from rational creatures, and sometimes are
    included under them. In this sense prayer is said to be proper to the
    rational creature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The young ravens are said to call upon
    God, on account of the natural desire whereby all things, each in its own
    way, desire to attain the Divine goodness. Thus too dumb animals are said to
    obey God, on account of the natural instinct whereby they are moved by
    God.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the saints in heaven pray for us?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the saints in heaven do not
    pray for us. A man's action is more meritorious for himself than for others.
    But the saints in heaven do not merit for themselves, neither do they pray
    for themselves, since they are already established in the term. Neither
    therefore do they pray for us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the saints conform their will to God
    perfectly, so that they will only what God wills. Now what God wills is
    always fulfilled. Therefore it would be useless for the saints to pray for
    us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the saints in heaven are above,
    so are those in Purgatory, for they can no longer sin. Now those in
    Purgatory do not pray for us, on the contrary we pray for them. Therefore
    neither do the saints in heaven pray for us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if the saints in heaven pray for us, the
    prayers of the higher saints would be more efficacious; and so we ought not
    to implore the help of the lower saints' prayers but only of those of the
    higher saints.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the soul of Peter is not Peter. If
    therefore the souls of the saints pray for us, so long as they are separated
    from their bodies, we ought not to call upon Saint Peter, but on his soul,
    to pray for us: yet the Church does the contrary. The saints therefore do
    not pray for us, at least before the resurrection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (2 Macc. 15:14): "This is... he
    that prayeth much for the people, and for all the holy city, Jeremias the
    prophet of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Jerome says (Cont. Vigilant. 6), the error
    of Vigilantius consisted in saying that "while we live, we can pray one for
    another; but that after we are dead, none of our prayers for others can be
    heard, seeing that not even the martyrs' prayers are granted when they pray
    for their blood to be avenged." But this is absolutely false, because, since
    prayers offered for others proceed from charity, as stated above (<a
      href="SS083.html#SSQ83ATHEP1"
      >Articles [7]</a
    >,8), the greater the charity of the saints in heaven, the more they pray
    for wayfarers, since the latter can be helped by prayers: and the more
    closely they are united to God, the more are their prayers efficacious: for
    the Divine order is such that lower beings receive an overflow of the
    excellence of the higher, even as the air receives the brightness of the
    sun. Wherefore it is said of Christ (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++7%3A25"
      >Heb. 7:25</a
    >): "Going to God by His own power... to make intercession for us" [*Vulg.:
    'He is able to save for ever them that come to God by Him, always living to
    make intercession for us.']. Hence Jerome says (Cont. Vigilant. 6): "If the
    apostles and martyrs while yet in the body and having to be solicitous for
    themselves, can pray for others, how much more now that they have the crown
    of victory and triumph."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The saints in heaven, since they are
    blessed, have no lack of bliss, save that of the body's glory, and for this
    they pray. But they pray for us who lack the ultimate perfection of bliss:
    and their prayers are efficacious in impetrating through their previous
    merits and through God's acceptance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The saints impetrate what ever God
    wishes to take place through their prayers: and they pray for that which
    they deem will be granted through their prayers according to God's will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who are in Purgatory though they
    are above us on account of their impeccability, yet they are below us as to
    the pains which they suffer: and in this respect they are not in a condition
    to pray, but rather in a condition that requires us to pray for them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> It is God's will that inferior beings
    should be helped by all those that are above them, wherefore we ought to
    pray not only to the higher but also to the lower saints; else we should
    have to implore the mercy of God alone. Nevertheless it happens sometime
    that prayers addressed to a saint of lower degree are more efficacious,
    either because he is implored with greater devotion, or because God wishes
    to make known his sanctity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> It is because the saints while living
    merited to pray for us, that we invoke them under the names by which they
    were known in this life, and by which they are better known to us: and also
    in order to indicate our belief in the resurrection, according to the saying
    of Ex. 3:6, "I am the God of Abraham," etc.<br />

  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prayer ought not to be vocal.
    As stated above (<a href="SS083.html#SSQ83A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), prayer
    is addressed chiefly to God. Now God knows the language of the heart.
    Therefore it is useless to employ vocal prayer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prayer should lift man's mind to God, as
    stated above (<a href="SS083.html#SSQ83A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2). But
    words, like other sensible objects, prevent man from ascending to God by
    contemplation. Therefore we should not use words in our prayers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, prayer should be offered to God in
    secret, according to Mt. 6:6, "But thou, when thou shalt pray, enter into
    thy chamber, and having shut the door, pray to thy Father in secret." But
    prayer loses its secrecy by being expressed vocally. Therefore prayer should
    not be vocal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++141%3A2"
      >Ps. 141:2</a
    >): "I cried to the Lord with my voice, with my voice I made supplication to
    the Lord."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Prayer is twofold, common and individual.
    Common prayer is that which is offered to God by the ministers of the Church
    representing the body of the faithful: wherefore such like prayer should
    come to the knowledge of the whole people for whom it is offered: and this
    would not be possible unless it were vocal prayer. Therefore it is
    reasonably ordained that the ministers of the Church should say these
    prayers even in a loud voice, so that they may come to the knowledge of
    all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand individual prayer is that which is offered by any single
    person, whether he pray for himself or for others; and it is not essential
    to such a prayer as this that it be vocal. And yet the voice is employed in
    such like prayers for three reasons. First, in order to excite interior
    devotion, whereby the mind of the person praying is raised to God, because
    by means of external signs, whether of words or of deeds, the human mind is
    moved as regards apprehension, and consequently also as regards the
    affections. Hence Augustine says (ad Probam. Ep. cxxx, 9) that "by means of
    words and other signs we arouse ourselves more effectively to an increase of
    holy desires." Hence then alone should we use words and such like signs when
    they help to excite the mind internally. But if they distract or in any way
    impede the mind we should abstain from them; and this happens chiefly to
    those whose mind is sufficiently prepared for devotion without having
    recourse to those signs. Wherefore the Psalmist (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++26%3A8"
      >Ps. 26:8</a
    >) said: "My heart hath said to Thee: 'My face hath sought Thee,'" and we
    read of Anna (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Sam++1%3A13"
      >1 Kgs. 1:13</a
    >) that "she spoke in her heart." Secondly, the voice is used in praying as
    though to pay a debt, so that man may serve God with all that he has from
    God, that is to say, not only with his mind, but also with his body: and
    this applies to prayer considered especially as satisfactory. Hence it is
    written (Osee 14:3): "Take away all iniquity, and receive the good: and we
    will render the calves of our lips." Thirdly, we have recourse to vocal
    prayer, through a certain overflow from the soul into the body, through
    excess of feeling, according to Ps. 15:9, "My heart hath been glad, and my
    tongue hath rejoiced."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Vocal prayer is employed, not in order
    to tell God something He does not know, but in order to lift up the mind of
    the person praying or of other persons to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Words about other matters distract the
    mind and hinder the devotion of those who pray: but words signifying some
    object of devotion lift up the mind, especially one that is less devout.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Chrysostom says [*Hom. xiii in the
    Opus Imperfectum falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom], "Our Lord forbids
    one to pray in presence of others in order that one may be seen by others.
    Hence when you pray, do nothing strange to draw men's attention, either by
    shouting so as to be heard by others, or by openly striking the heart, or
    extending the hands, so as to be seen by many. And yet, "according to
    Augustine (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 3), "it is not wrong to be seen by
    men, but to do this or that in order to be seen by men."<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether attention is a necessary condition of prayer?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that attention is a necessary
    condition of prayer. It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++4%3A24"
      >Jn. 4:24</a
    >): "God is a spirit, and they that adore Him must adore Him in spirit and
    in truth." But prayer is not in spirit unless it be attentive. Therefore
    attention is a necessary condition of prayer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prayer is "the ascent of the mind to
    God" [*Damascene, De Fide Orth. iii, 24]. But the mind does not ascend to
    God if the prayer is inattentive. Therefore attention is a necessary
    condition of prayer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is a necessary condition of prayer
    that it should be altogether sinless. Now if a man allows his mind to wander
    while praying he is not free of sin, for he seems to make light of God; even
    as if he were to speak to another man without attending to what he was
    saying. Hence Basil says [*De Constit. Monach. i] that the "Divine
    assistance is to be implored, not lightly, nor with a mind wandering hither
    and thither: because he that prays thus not only will not obtain what he
    asks, nay rather will he provoke God to anger." Therefore it would seem a
    necessary condition of prayer that it should be attentive.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Even holy men sometimes suffer from a
    wandering of the mind when they pray, according to Ps. 39:13, "My heart hath
    forsaken me."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This question applies chiefly to vocal prayer.
    Accordingly we must observe that a thing is necessary in two ways. First, a
    thing is necessary because thereby the end is better obtained: and thus
    attention is absolutely necessary for prayer. Secondly, a thing is said to
    be necessary when without it something cannot obtain its effect. Now the
    effect of prayer is threefold. The first is an effect which is common to all
    acts quickened by charity, and this is merit. In order to realize this
    effect, it is not necessary that prayer should be attentive throughout;
    because the force of the original intention with which one sets about
    praying renders the whole prayer meritorious, as is the case with other
    meritorious acts. The second effect of prayer is proper thereto, and
    consists in impetration: and again the original intention, to which God
    looks chiefly, suffices to obtain this effect. But if the original intention
    is lacking, prayer lacks both merit and impetration: because, as Gregory
    [*Hugh St. Victor, Expos. in Reg. S. Aug. iii] says, "God hears not the
    prayer of those who pay no attention to their prayer." The third effect of
    prayer is that which it produces at once; this is the spiritual refreshment
    of the mind, and for this effect attention is a necessary condition:
    wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++14%3A14"
      >1 Cor. 14:14</a
    >): "If I pray in a tongue... my understanding is without fruit."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It must be observed, however, that there are three kinds of attention that
    can be brought to vocal prayer: one which attends to the words, lest we say
    them wrong, another which attends to the sense of the words, and a third,
    which attends to the end of prayer, namely, God, and to the thing we are
    praying for. That last kind of attention is most necessary, and even idiots
    are capable of it. Moreover this attention, whereby the mind is fixed on
    God, is sometimes so strong that the mind forgets all other things, as Hugh
    of St. Victor states [*De Modo Orandi ii].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To pray in spirit and in truth is to set
    about praying through the instigation of the Spirit, even though afterwards
    the mind wander through weakness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The human mind is unable to remain aloft
    for long on account of the weakness of nature, because human weakness weighs
    down the soul to the level of inferior things: and hence it is that when,
    while praying, the mind ascends to God by contemplation, of a sudden it
    wanders off through weakness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Purposely to allow one's mind to wander
    in prayer is sinful and hinders the prayer from having fruit. It is against
    this that Augustine says in his Rule (Ep. ccxi): "When you pray God with
    psalms and hymns, let your mind attend to that which your lips pronounce."
    But to wander in mind unintentionally does not deprive prayer of its fruit.
    Hence Basil says (De Constit. Monach. i): "If you are so truly weakened by
    sin that you are unable to pray attentively, strive as much as you can to
    curb yourself, and God will pardon you, seeing that you are unable to stand
    in His presence in a becoming manner, not through negligence but through
    frailty."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether prayer should last a long time?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prayer should not be
    continual. It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A7"
      >Mt. 6:7</a
    >): "When you are praying, speak not much." Now one who prays a long time
    needs to speak much, especially if his be vocal prayer. Therefore prayer
    should not last a long time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prayer expresses the desire. Now a
    desire is all the holier according as it is centered on one thing, according
    to Ps. 26:4, "One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after."
    Therefore the shorter prayer is, the more is it acceptable to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it seems to be wrong to transgress the
    limits fixed by God, especially in matters concerning Divine worship,
    according to Ex. 19:21: "Charge the people, lest they should have a mind to
    pass the limits to see the Lord, and a very great multitude of them should
    perish." But God has fixed for us the limits of prayer by instituting the
    Lord's Prayer (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6"
      >Mt. 6</a
    >). Therefore it is not right to prolong our prayer beyond its limits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> On the contrary, It would seem that we ought to
    pray continually. For our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++18%3A1"
      >Lk. 18:1</a
    >): "We ought always to pray, and not to faint": and it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Thess++5%3A17"
      >1 Thess. 5:17</a
    >): "Pray without ceasing."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We may speak about prayer in two ways: first,
    by considering it in itself; secondly, by considering it in its cause. The
    not cause of prayer is the desire of charity, from which prayer ought to
    arise: and this desire ought to be in us continually, either actually or
    virtually, for the virtue of this desire remains in whatever we do out of
    charity; and we ought to "do all things to the glory of God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++10%3A31"
      >1 Cor. 10:31</a
    >). From this point of view prayer ought to be continual: wherefore
    Augustine says (ad Probam, Ep. cxxx, 9): "Faith, hope and charity are by
    themselves a prayer of continual longing." But prayer, considered in itself,
    cannot be continual, because we have to be busy about other works, and, as
    Augustine says (ad Probam. Ep. cxxx, 9), "we pray to God with our lips at
    certain intervals and seasons, in order to admonish ourselves by means of
    such like signs, to take note of the amount of our progress in that desire,
    and to arouse ourselves more eagerly to an increase thereof." Now the
    quantity of a thing should be commensurate with its end, for instance the
    quantity of the dose should be commensurate with health. And so it is
    becoming that prayer should last long enough to arouse the fervor of the
    interior desire: and when it exceeds this measure, so that it cannot be
    continued any longer without causing weariness, it should be discontinued.
    Wherefore Augustine says (ad Probam. Ep. cxxx): "It is said that the
    brethren in Egypt make frequent but very short prayers, rapid ejaculations,
    as it were, lest that vigilant and erect attention which is so necessary in
    prayer slacken and languish, through the strain being prolonged. By so doing
    they make it sufficiently clear not only that this attention must not be
    forced if we are unable to keep it up, but also that if we are able to
    continue, it should not be broken off too soon." And just as we must judge
    of this in private prayers by considering the attention of the person
    praying, so too, in public prayers we must judge of it by considering the
    devotion of the people.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (ad Probam. Ep. cxxx),
    "to pray with many words is not the same as to pray long; to speak long is
    one thing, to be devout long is another. For it is written that our Lord
    passed the whole night in prayer, and that He 'prayed the longer' in order
    to set us an example." Further on he says: "When praying say little, yet
    pray much so long as your attention is fervent. For to say much in prayer is
    to discuss your need in too many words: whereas to pray much is to knock at
    the door of Him we pray, by the continuous and devout clamor of the heart.
    Indeed this business is frequently done with groans rather than with words,
    with tears rather than with speech."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Length of prayer consists, not in
    praying for many things, but in the affections persisting in the desire of
    one thing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Our Lord instituted this prayer, not
    that we might use no other words when we pray, but that in our prayers we
    might have none but these things in view, no matter how we express them or
    think of them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> One may pray continually, either through
    having a continual desire, as stated above; or through praying at certain
    fixed times, though interruptedly; or by reason of the effect, whether in
    the person who prays---because he remains more devout even after praying, or
    in some other person---as when by his kindness a man incites another to pray
    for him, even after he himself has ceased praying.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether prayer is meritorious?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prayer is not meritorious. All
    merit proceeds from grace. But prayer precedes grace, since even grace is
    obtained by means of prayer according to Lk. 11:13, "(How much more) will
    your Father from heaven give the good Spirit to them that ask Him!"
    Therefore prayer is not a meritorious act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if prayer merits anything, this would
    seem to be chiefly that which is besought in prayer. Yet it does not always
    merit this, because even the saints' prayers are frequently not heard; thus
    Paul was not heard when he besought the sting of the flesh to be removed
    from him. Therefore prayer is not a meritorious act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, prayer is based chiefly on faith,
    according to James 1:6, "But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering." Now
    faith is not sufficient for merit, as instanced in those who have lifeless
    faith. Therefore prayer is not a meritorious act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on the words of Ps. 34:13, "My prayer
    shall be turned into my bosom," explains them as meaning, "if my prayer does
    not profit them, yet shall not I be deprived of my reward." Now reward is
    not due save to merit. Therefore prayer is meritorious.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS083.html#SSQ83A13THEP1"
      >Article [13]</a
    >) prayer, besides causing spiritual consolation at the time of praying, has
    a twofold efficacy in respect of a future effect, namely, efficacy in
    meriting and efficacy in impetrating. Now prayer, like any other virtuous
    act, is efficacious in meriting, because it proceeds from charity as its
    root, the proper object of which is the eternal good that we merit to enjoy.
    Yet prayer proceeds from charity through the medium of religion, of which
    prayer is an act, as stated above (<a href="SS083.html#SSQ83A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), and with the concurrence of other virtues requisite for the goodness of
    prayer, viz. humility and faith. For the offering of prayer itself to God
    belongs to religion, while the desire for the thing. that we pray to be
    accomplished belongs to charity. Faith is necessary in reference to God to
    Whom we pray; that is, we need to believe that we can obtain from Him what
    we seek. Humility is necessary on the part of the person praying, because he
    recognizes his neediness. Devotion too is necessary: but this belongs to
    religion, for it is its first act and a necessary condition of all its
    secondary acts, as stated above (<a href="SS082.html#SSQ82OUTP1"
      >Question [82]</a
    >, <a href="SS082.html#SSQ82ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As to its efficacy in impetrating, prayer derives this from the grace of God
    to Whom we pray, and Who instigates us to pray. Wherefore Augustine says (De
    Verb. Dom., Serm. cv, 1): "He would not urge us to ask, unless He were
    willing to give"; and Chrysostom [*Cf. Catena Aurea of St. Thomas on Lk. 18.
    The words as quoted are not to be found in the words of Chrysostom] says:
    "He never refuses to grant our prayers, since in His loving-kindness He
    urged us not to faint in praying."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Neither prayer nor any other virtuous
    act is meritorious without sanctifying grace. And yet even that prayer which
    impetrates sanctifying grace proceeds from some grace, as from a gratuitous
    gift, since the very act of praying is "a gift of God," as Augustine states
    (De Persever. xxiii).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sometimes the merit of prayer regards
    chiefly something distinct from the object of one's petition. For the chief
    object of merit is beatitude, whereas the direct object of the petition of
    prayer extends sometimes to certain other things, as stated above (<a
      href="SS083.html#SSQ83ATHEP1"
      >Articles [6]</a
    >,7). Accordingly if this other thing that we ask for ourselves be not
    useful for our beatitude, we do not merit it; and sometimes by asking for
    and desiring such things we lose merit for instance if we ask of God the
    accomplishment of some sin, which would be an impious prayer. And sometimes
    it is not necessary for salvation, nor yet manifestly contrary thereto; and
    then although he who prays may merit eternal life by praying, yet he does
    not merit to obtain what he asks for. Hence Augustine says (Liber. Sentent.
    Prosperi sent. ccxii): "He who faithfully prays God for the necessaries of
    this life, is both mercifully heard, and mercifully not heard. For the
    physician knows better than the sick man what is good for the disease." For
    this reason, too, Paul was not heard when he prayed for the removal of the
    sting in his flesh, because this was not expedient. If, however, we pray for
    something that is useful for our beatitude, through being conducive to
    salvation, we merit it not only by praying, but also by doing other good
    deeds: therefore without any doubt we receive what we ask for, yet when we
    ought to receive it: "since certain things are not denied us, but are
    deferred that they may be granted at a suitable time," according to
    Augustine (Tract. cii in Joan.): and again this may be hindered if we
    persevere not in asking for it. Wherefore Basil says (De Constit. Monast.
    i): "The reason why sometimes thou hast asked and not received, is because
    thou hast asked amiss, either inconsistently, or lightly, or because thou
    hast asked for what was not good for thee, or because thou hast ceased
    asking." Since, however, a man cannot condignly merit eternal life for
    another, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114OUTP1">Question [114]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS114.html#FSQ114A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), it follows that
    sometimes one cannot condignly merit for another things that pertain to
    eternal life. For this reason we are not always heard when we pray for
    others, as stated above (<a href="SS083.html#SSQ83A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>,
    ad 2,3). Hence it is that four conditions are laid down; namely, to
    ask---"for ourselves---things necessary for
    salvation---piously---perseveringly"; when all these four concur, we always
    obtain what we ask for.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Prayer depends chiefly on faith, not for
    its efficacy in meriting, because thus it depends chiefly on charity, but
    for its efficacy in impetrating, because it is through faith that man comes
    to know of God's omnipotence and mercy, which are the source whence prayer
    impetrates what it asks for.<br />

    Whether sinners impetrate anything from God by their prayers?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sinners impetrate nothing from
    God by their prayers. It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++9%3A31"
      >Jn. 9:31</a
    >): "We know that God doth not hear sinners"; and this agrees with the
    saying of Prov. 28:9, "He that turneth away his ears from hearing the law,
    his prayer shall be an abomination." Now an abominable prayer impetrates
    nothing from God. Therefore sinners impetrate nothing from God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the just impetrate from God what they
    merit, as stated above (<a href="SS083.html#SSQ83A15THEP1">Article [15]</a>,
    ad 2). But sinners cannot merit anything since they lack grace and charity
    which is the "power of godliness," according to a gloss on 2 Tim. 3:5,
    "Having an appearance indeed of godliness, but denying the power thereof."
    and so their prayer is impious, and yet piety it required in order that
    prayer may be impetrative, as stated above (<a
      href="SS083.html#SSQ83A15THEP1"
      >Article [15]</a
    >, ad 2). Therefore sinners impetrate nothing by their prayers.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Chrysostom [*Hom. xiv in the Opus
    Imperfectum falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom] says: "The Father is
    unwilling to hear the prayer which the Son has not inspired." Now in the
    prayer inspired by Christ we say: "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
    them that trespass against us": and sinners do not fulfil this. Therefore
    either they lie in saying this, and so are unworthy to be heard, or, if they
    do not say it, they are not heard, because they do not observe the form of
    prayer instituted by Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Tract. xliv, super Joan.):
    "If God were not to hear sinners, the publican would have vainly said: Lord,
    be merciful to me a sinner"; and Chrysostom [*Hom. xviii of the same Opus
    Imperfectum] says: "Everyone that asketh shall receive, that is to say
    whether he be righteous or sinful."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the sinner, two things are to be considered:
    his nature which God loves, and the sin which He hates. Accordingly when a
    sinner prays for something as sinner, i.e. in accordance with a sinful
    desire, God hears him not through mercy but sometimes through vengeance when
    He allows the sinner to fall yet deeper into sin. For "God refuses in mercy
    what He grants in anger," as Augustine declares (Tract. lxxiii in Joan.). On
    the other hand God hears the sinner's prayer if it proceed from a good
    natural desire, not out of justice, because the sinner does not merit to be
    heard, but out of pure mercy [*Cf. Article [15], ad 1], provided however he
    fulfil the four conditions given above, namely, that he beseech for himself
    things necessary for salvation, piously and perseveringly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine states (Tract. xliv super
    Joan.), these words were spoken by the blind man before being anointed, i.e.
    perfectly enlightened, and consequently lack authority. And yet there is
    truth in the saying if it refers to a sinner as such, in which sense also
    the sinner's prayer is said to be an abomination.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There can be no godliness in the
    sinner's prayer as though his prayer were quickened by a habit of virtue:
    and yet his prayer may be godly in so far as he asks for something
    pertaining to godliness. Even so a man who has not the habit of justice is
    able to will something just, as stated above (<a
      href="SS059.html#SSQ59OUTP1"
      >Question [59]</a
    >, <a href="SS059.html#SSQ59A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). And though his prayer
    is not meritorious, it can be impetrative, because merit depends on justice,
    whereas impetration rests on grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS083.html#SSQ83A7THEP1"
      >Article [7]</a
    >, ad 1) the Lord's Prayer is pronounced in the common person of the whole
    Church: and so if anyone say the Lord's Prayer while unwilling to forgive
    his neighbor's trespasses, he lies not, although his words do not apply to
    him personally: for they are true as referred to the person of the Church,
    from which he is excluded by merit, and consequently he is deprived of the
    fruit of his prayer. Sometimes, however, a sinner is prepared to forgive
    those who have trespassed against him, wherefore his prayers are heard,
    according to Ecclus. 28:2, "Forgive thy neighbor if he hath hurt thee, and
    then shall thy sins be forgiven to thee when thou prayest."<br />

    Whether the parts of prayer are fittingly described as supplications,
    prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the parts of prayer are
    unfittingly described as supplications, prayers, intercessions, and
    thanksgivings. Supplication would seem to be a kind of adjuration. Yet,
    according to Origen (Super Matth. Tract. xxxv), "a man who wishes to live
    according to the gospel need not adjure another, for if it be unlawful to
    swear, it is also unlawful to adjure." Therefore supplication is unfittingly
    reckoned a part of prayer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Damascene (De Fide Orth.
    iii, 24), "to pray is to ask becoming things of God." Therefore it is
    unfitting to distinguish "prayers" from "intercessions."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, thanksgivings regard the past, while the
    others regard the future. But the past precedes the future. Therefore
    thanksgivings are unfittingly placed after the others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> suffices the authority of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++2%3A1"
      >1 Tim. 2:1</a
    >).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Three conditions are requisite for prayer.
    First, that the person who prays should approach God Whom he prays: this is
    signified in the word "prayer," because prayer is "the raising up of one's
    mind to God." The second is that there should be a petition, and this is
    signified in the word "intercession." In this case sometimes one asks for
    something definite, and then some say it is "intercession" properly so
    called, or we may ask for some thing indefinitely, for instance to be helped
    by God, or we may simply indicate a fact, as in Jn. 11:3, "Behold, he whom
    Thou lovest is sick," and then they call it "insinuation." The third
    condition is the reason for impetrating what we ask for: and this either on
    the part of God, or on the part of the person who asks. The reason of
    impetration on the part of God is His sanctity, on account of which we ask
    to be heard, according to Dan. 9:17,18, "For Thy own sake, incline, O God,
    Thy ear"; and to this pertains "supplication" [obsecratio] which means a
    pleading through sacred things, as when we say, "Through Thy nativity,
    deliver us, O Lord." The reason for impetration on the part of the person
    who asks is "thanksgiving"; since "through giving thanks for benefits
    received we merit to receive yet greater benefits," as we say in the collect
    [*Ember Friday in September and Postcommunion of the common of a Confessor
    Bishop]. Hence a gloss on 1 Tim. 2:1 says that "in the Mass, the
    consecration is preceded by supplication," in which certain sacred things
    are called to mind; that "prayers are in the consecration itself," in which
    especially the mind should be raised up to God; and that "intercessions are
    in the petitions that follow, and thanksgivings at the end."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We may notice these four things in several of the Church's collects. Thus in
    the collect of Trinity Sunday the words, "Almighty eternal God" belong to
    the offering up of prayer to God; the words, "Who hast given to Thy
    servants," etc. belong to thanksgiving; the words, "grant, we beseech Thee,"
    belong to intercession; and the words at the end, "Through Our Lord," etc.
    belong to supplication.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the "Conferences of the Fathers" (ix, cap. 11, seqq.) we read:
    "Supplication is bewailing one's sins; prayer is vowing something to God;
    intercession is praying for others; thanksgiving is offered by the mind to
    God in ineffable ecstasy." The first explanation, however, is the better.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> "Supplication" is an adjuration not for
    the purpose of compelling, for this is forbidden, but in order to implore
    mercy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> "Prayer" in the general sense includes
    all the things mentioned here; but when distinguished from the others it
    denotes properly the ascent to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Among things that are diverse the past
    precedes the future; but the one and same thing is future before it is past.
    Hence thanksgiving for other benefits precedes intercession: but one and the
    same benefit is first sought, and finally, when it has been received, we
    give thanks for it. Intercession is preceded by prayer whereby we approach
    Him of Whom we ask: and prayer is preceded by supplication, whereby through
    the consideration of God's goodness we dare approach Him.<br />
