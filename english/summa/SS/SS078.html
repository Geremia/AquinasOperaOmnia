    (E) BY SINS COMMITTED IN LOANS (Question [78])<br />
    <br />
    OF THE SIN OF USURY (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the sin of usury, which is committed in loans: and
    under this head there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS078.html#SSQ78A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is a sin to take money
    as a price for money lent, which is to receive usury?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS078.html#SSQ78A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is lawful to lend money
    for any other kind of consideration, by way of payment for the loan?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS078.html#SSQ78A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether a man is bound to restore
    just gains derived from money taken in usury?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS078.html#SSQ78A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is lawful to borrow
    money under a condition of usury?

  <h3 align="left">Whether it is a sin to take usury for money lent?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not a sin to take usury
    for money lent. For no man sins through following the example of Christ. But
    Our Lord said of Himself (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++19%3A23"
      >Lk. 19:23</a
    >): "At My coming I might have exacted it," i.e. the money lent, "with
    usury." Therefore it is not a sin to take usury for lending money.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Ps. 18:8, "The law of the
    Lord is unspotted," because, to wit, it forbids sin. Now usury of a kind is
    allowed in the Divine law, according to Dt. 23:19,20: "Thou shalt not
    fenerate to thy brother money, nor corn, nor any other thing, but to the
    stranger": nay more, it is even promised as a reward for the observance of
    the Law, according to Dt. 28:12: "Thou shalt fenerate* to many nations, and
    shalt not borrow of any one." [*'Faeneraberis'---'Thou shalt lend upon
    usury.' The Douay version has simply 'lend.' The objection lays stress on
    the word 'faeneraberis': hence the necessity of rendering it by 'fenerate.']
    Therefore it is not a sin to take usury.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in human affairs justice is determined
    by civil laws. Now civil law allows usury to be taken. Therefore it seems to
    be lawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the counsels are not binding under sin.
    But, among other counsels we find (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++6%3A35"
      >Lk. 6:35</a
    >): "Lend, hoping for nothing thereby." Therefore it is not a sin to take
    usury.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, it does not seem to be in itself sinful
    to accept a price for doing what one is not bound to do. But one who has
    money is not bound in every case to lend it to his neighbor. Therefore it is
    lawful for him sometimes to accept a price for lending it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, silver made into coins does not differ
    specifically from silver made into a vessel. But it is lawful to accept a
    price for the loan of a silver vessel. Therefore it is also lawful to accept
    a price for the loan of a silver coin. Therefore usury is not in itself a
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, anyone may lawfully accept a thing which
    its owner freely gives him. Now he who accepts the loan, freely gives the
    usury. Therefore he who lends may lawfully take the usury.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++22%3A25"
      >Ex. 22:25</a
    >): "If thou lend money to any of thy people that is poor, that dwelleth
    with thee, thou shalt not be hard upon them as an extortioner, nor oppress
    them with usuries."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> To take usury for money lent is unjust in
    itself, because this is to sell what does not exist, and this evidently
    leads to inequality which is contrary to justice. In order to make this
    evident, we must observe that there are certain things the use of which
    consists in their consumption: thus we consume wine when we use it for drink
    and we consume wheat when we use it for food. Wherefore in such like things
    the use of the thing must not be reckoned apart from the thing itself, and
    whoever is granted the use of the thing, is granted the thing itself and for
    this reason, to lend things of this kin is to transfer the ownership.
    Accordingly if a man wanted to sell wine separately from the use of the
    wine, he would be selling the same thing twice, or he would be selling what
    does not exist, wherefore he would evidently commit a sin of injustice. In
    like manner he commits an injustice who lends wine or wheat, and asks for
    double payment, viz. one, the return of the thing in equal measure, the
    other, the price of the use, which is called usury.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, there are things the use of which does not consist in
    their consumption: thus to use a house is to dwell in it, not to destroy it.
    Wherefore in such things both may be granted: for instance, one man may hand
    over to another the ownership of his house while reserving to himself the
    use of it for a time, or vice versa, he may grant the use of the house,
    while retaining the ownership. For this reason a man may lawfully make a
    charge for the use of his house, and, besides this, revendicate the house
    from the person to whom he has granted its use, as happens in renting and
    letting a house.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now money, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 5; Polit. i, 3) was
    invented chiefly for the purpose of exchange: and consequently the proper
    and principal use of money is its consumption or alienation whereby it is
    sunk in exchange. Hence it is by its very nature unlawful to take payment
    for the use of money lent, which payment is known as usury: and just as a
    man is bound to restore other ill-gotten goods, so is he bound to restore
    the money which he has taken in usury.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In this passage usury must be taken
    figuratively for the increase of spiritual goods which God exacts from us,
    for He wishes us ever to advance in the goods which we receive from Him: and
    this is for our own profit not for His.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Jews were forbidden to take usury
    from their brethren, i.e. from other Jews. By this we are given to
    understand that to take usury from any man is evil simply, because we ought
    to treat every man as our neighbor and brother, especially in the state of
    the Gospel, whereto all are called. Hence it is said without any distinction
    in Ps. 14:5: "He that hath not put out his money to usury," and (Ezech.
    18:8): "Who hath not taken usury [*Vulg.: 'If a man... hath not lent upon
    money, nor taken any increase... he is just.']." They were permitted,
    however, to take usury from foreigners, not as though it were lawful, but in
    order to avoid a greater evil, lest, to wit, through avarice to which they
    were prone according to Is. 56:11, they should take usury from the Jews who
    were worshippers of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Where we find it promised to them as a reward, "Thou shalt fenerate to many
    nations," etc., fenerating is to be taken in a broad sense for lending, as
    in Ecclus. 29:10, where we read: "Many have refused to fenerate, not out of
    wickedness," i.e. they would not lend. Accordingly the Jews are promised in
    reward an abundance of wealth, so that they would be able to lend to
    others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Human laws leave certain things
    unpunished, on account of the condition of those who are imperfect, and who
    would be deprived of many advantages, if all sins were strictly forbidden
    and punishments appointed for them. Wherefore human law has permitted usury,
    not that it looks upon usury as harmonizing with justice, but lest the
    advantage of many should be hindered. Hence it is that in civil law [*Inst.
    II, iv, de Usufructu] it is stated that "those things according to natural
    reason and civil law which are consumed by being used, do not admit of
    usufruct," and that "the senate did not (nor could it) appoint a usufruct to
    such things, but established a quasi-usufruct," namely by permitting usury.
    Moreover the Philosopher, led by natural reason, says (Polit. i, 3) that "to
    make money by usury is exceedingly unnatural."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A man is not always bound to lend, and
    for this reason it is placed among the counsels. Yet it is a matter of
    precept not to seek profit by lending: although it may be called a matter of
    counsel in comparison with the maxims of the Pharisees, who deemed some
    kinds of usury to be lawful, just as love of one's enemies is a matter of
    counsel. Or again, He speaks here not of the hope of usurious gain, but of
    the hope which is put in man. For we ought not to lend or do any good deed
    through hope in man, but only through hope in God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> He that is not bound to lend, may accept
    repayment for what he has done, but he must not exact more. Now he is repaid
    according to equality of justice if he is repaid as much as he lent.
    Wherefore if he exacts more for the usufruct of a thing which has no other
    use but the consumption of its substance, he exacts a price of something
    non-existent: and so his exaction is unjust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> The principal use of a silver vessel is
    not its consumption, and so one may lawfully sell its use while retaining
    one's ownership of it. On the other hand the principal use of silver money
    is sinking it in exchange, so that it is not lawful to sell its use and at
    the same time expect the restitution of the amount lent. It must be
    observed, however, that the secondary use of silver vessels may be an
    exchange, and such use may not be lawfully sold. In like manner there may be
    some secondary use of silver money; for instance, a man might lend coins for
    show, or to be used as security.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> He who gives usury does not give it
    voluntarily simply, but under a certain necessity, in so far as he needs to
    borrow money which the owner is unwilling to lend without usury.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether it is lawful to ask for any other kind of consideration for money
    lent?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one may ask for some other
    kind of consideration for money lent. For everyone may lawfully seek to
    indemnify himself. Now sometimes a man suffers loss through lending money.
    Therefore he may lawfully ask for or even exact something else besides the
    money lent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated in Ethic. v, 5, one is in duty
    bound by a point of honor, to repay anyone who has done us a favor. Now to
    lend money to one who is in straits is to do him a favor for which he should
    be grateful. Therefore the recipient of a loan, is bound by a natural debt
    to repay something. Now it does not seem unlawful to bind oneself to an
    obligation of the natural law. Therefore it is not unlawful, in lending
    money to anyone, to demand some sort of compensation as condition of the
    loan.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as there is real remuneration, so
    is there verbal remuneration, and remuneration by service, as a gloss says
    on Is. 33:15, "Blessed is he that shaketh his hands from all bribes [*Vulg.:
    'Which of you shall dwell with everlasting burnings?... He that shaketh his
    hands from all bribes.']." Now it is lawful to accept service or praise from
    one to whom one has lent money. Therefore in like manner it is lawful to
    accept any other kind of remuneration.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, seemingly the relation of gift to gift
    is the same as of loan to loan. But it is lawful to accept money for money
    given. Therefore it is lawful to accept repayment by loan in return for a
    loan granted.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the lender, by transferring his
    ownership of a sum of money removes the money further from himself than he
    who entrusts it to a merchant or craftsman. Now it is lawful to receive
    interest for money entrusted to a merchant or craftsman. Therefore it is
    also lawful to receive interest for money lent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, a man may accept a pledge for money
    lent, the use of which pledge he might sell for a price: as when a man
    mortgages his land or the house wherein he dwells. Therefore it is lawful to
    receive interest for money lent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, it sometimes happens that a man raises
    the price of his goods under guise of loan, or buys another's goods at a low
    figure; or raises his price through delay in being paid, and lowers his
    price that he may be paid the sooner. Now in all these cases there seems to
    be payment for a loan of money: nor does it appear to be manifestly illicit.
    Therefore it seems to be lawful to expect or exact some consideration for
    money lent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Among other conditions requisite in a just
    man it is stated (Ezech. 18:17) that he "hath not taken usury and
    increase."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 1), a
    thing is reckoned as money "if its value can be measured by money."
    Consequently, just as it is a sin against justice, to take money, by tacit
    or express agreement, in return for lending money or anything else that is
    consumed by being used, so also is it a like sin, by tacit or express
    agreement to receive anything whose price can be measured by money. Yet
    there would be no sin in receiving something of the kind, not as exacting
    it, nor yet as though it were due on account of some agreement tacit or
    expressed, but as a gratuity: since, even before lending the money, one
    could accept a gratuity, nor is one in a worse condition through lending.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand it is lawful to exact compensation for a loan, in respect
    of such things as are not appreciated by a measure of money, for instance,
    benevolence, and love for the lender, and so forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A lender may without sin enter an
    agreement with the borrower for compensation for the loss he incurs of
    something he ought to have, for this is not to sell the use of money but to
    avoid a loss. It may also happen that the borrower avoids a greater loss
    than the lender incurs, wherefore the borrower may repay the lender with
    what he has gained. But the lender cannot enter an agreement for
    compensation, through the fact that he makes no profit out of his money:
    because he must not sell that which he has not yet and may be prevented in
    many ways from having.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Repayment for a favor may be made in two
    ways. In one way, as a debt of justice; and to such a debt a man may be
    bound by a fixed contract; and its amount is measured according to the favor
    received. Wherefore the borrower of money or any such thing the use of which
    is its consumption is not bound to repay more than he received in loan: and
    consequently it is against justice if he be obliged to pay back more. In
    another way a man's obligation to repayment for favor received is based on a
    debt of friendship, and the nature of this debt depends more on the feeling
    with which the favor was conferred than on the greatness of the favor
    itself. This debt does not carry with it a civil obligation, involving a
    kind of necessity that would exclude the spontaneous nature of such a
    repayment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If a man were, in return for money lent,
    as though there had been an agreement tacit or expressed, to expect or exact
    repayment in the shape of some remuneration of service or words, it would be
    the same as if he expected or exacted some real remuneration, because both
    can be priced at a money value, as may be seen in the case of those who
    offer for hire the labor which they exercise by work or by tongue. If on the
    other hand the remuneration by service or words be given not as an
    obligation, but as a favor, which is not to be appreciated at a money value,
    it is lawful to take, exact, and expect it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Money cannot be sold for a greater sum
    than the amount lent, which has to be paid back: nor should the loan be made
    with a demand or expectation of aught else but of a feeling of benevolence
    which cannot be priced at a pecuniary value, and which can be the basis of a
    spontaneous loan. Now the obligation to lend in return at some future time
    is repugnant to such a feeling, because again an obligation of this kind has
    its pecuniary value. Consequently it is lawful for the lender to borrow
    something else at the same time, but it is unlawful for him to bind the
    borrower to grant him a loan at some future time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> He who lends money transfers the
    ownership of the money to the borrower. Hence the borrower holds the money
    at his own risk and is bound to pay it all back: wherefore the lender must
    not exact more. On the other hand he that entrusts his money to a merchant
    or craftsman so as to form a kind of society, does not transfer the
    ownership of his money to them, for it remains his, so that at his risk the
    merchant speculates with it, or the craftsman uses it for his craft, and
    consequently he may lawfully demand as something belonging to him, part of
    the profits derived from his money.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> If a man in return for money lent to him
    pledges something that can be valued at a price, the lender must allow for
    the use of that thing towards the repayment of the loan. Else if he wishes
    the gratuitous use of that thing in addition to repayment, it is the same as
    if he took money for lending, and that is usury, unless perhaps it were such
    a thing as friends are wont to lend to one another gratis, as in the case of
    the loan of a book.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> If a man wish to sell his goods at a
    higher price than that which is just, so that he may wait for the buyer to
    pay, it is manifestly a case of usury: because this waiting for the payment
    of the price has the character of a loan, so that whatever he demands beyond
    the just price in consideration of this delay, is like a price for a loan,
    which pertains to usury. In like manner if a buyer wishes to buy goods at a
    lower price than what is just, for the reason that he pays for the goods
    before they can be delivered, it is a sin of usury; because again this
    anticipated payment of money has the character of a loan, the price of which
    is the rebate on the just price of the goods sold. On the other hand if a
    man wishes to allow a rebate on the just price in order that he may have his
    money sooner, he is not guilty of the sin of usury.<br />

    Whether a man is bound to restore whatever profits he has made out of money
    gotten by usury?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man is bound to restore
    whatever profits he has made out of money gotten by usury. For the Apostle
    says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++11%3A16"
      >Rm. 11:16</a
    >): "If the root be holy, so are the branches." Therefore likewise if the
    root be rotten so are the branches. But the root was infected with usury.
    Therefore whatever profit is made therefrom is infected with usury.
    Therefore he is bound to restore it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is laid down (Extra, De Usuris, in
    the Decretal: 'Cum tu sicut asseris'): "Property accruing from usury must be
    sold, and the price repaid to the persons from whom the usury was extorted."
    Therefore, likewise, whatever else is acquired from usurious money must be
    restored.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which a man buys with the proceeds
    of usury is due to him by reason of the money he paid for it. Therefore he
    has no more right to the thing purchased than to the money he paid. But he
    was bound to restore the money gained through usury. Therefore he is also
    bound to restore what he acquired with it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A man may lawfully hold what he has lawfully
    acquired. Now that which is acquired by the proceeds of usury is sometimes
    lawfully acquired. Therefore it may be lawfully retained.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS078.html#SSQ78A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), there are certain things whose use is their consumption, and which do
    not admit of usufruct, according to law (ibid., ad 3). Wherefore if such
    like things be extorted by means of usury, for instance money, wheat, wine
    and so forth, the lender is not bound to restore more than he received
    (since what is acquired by such things is the fruit not of the thing but of
    human industry), unless indeed the other party by losing some of his own
    goods be injured through the lender retaining them: for then he is bound to
    make good the loss.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, there are certain things whose use is not their
    consumption: such things admit of usufruct, for instance house or land
    property and so forth. Wherefore if a man has by usury extorted from another
    his house or land, he is bound to restore not only the house or land but
    also the fruits accruing to him therefrom, since they are the fruits of
    things owned by another man and consequently are due to him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The root has not only the character of
    matter, as money made by usury has; but has also somewhat the character of
    an active cause, in so far as it administers nourishment. Hence the
    comparison fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Property acquired from usury
    does not belong to the person who paid usury, but to the person who bought
    it. Yet he that paid usury has a certain claim on that property just as he
    has on the other goods of the usurer. Hence it is not prescribed that such
    property should be assigned to the persons who paid usury, since the
    property is perhaps worth more than what they paid in usury, but it is
    commanded that the property be sold, and the price be restored, of course
    according to the amount taken in usury.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The proceeds of money taken in usury are
    due to the person who acquired them not by reason of the usurious money as
    instrumental cause, but on account of his own industry as principal cause.
    Wherefore he has more right to the goods acquired with usurious money than
    to the usurious money itself.<br />

    Whether it is lawful to borrow money under a condition of usury?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not lawful to borrow
    money under a condition of usury. For the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++1%3A32"
      >Rm. 1:32</a
    >) that they "are worthy of death... not only they that do" these sins, "but
    they also that consent to them that do them." Now he that borrows money
    under a condition of usury consents in the sin of the usurer, and gives him
    an occasion of sin. Therefore he sins also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, for no temporal advantage ought one to
    give another an occasion of committing a sin: for this pertains to active
    scandal, which is always sinful, as stated above (<a
      href="SS043.html#SSQ43OUTP1"
      >Question [43]</a
    >, <a href="SS043.html#SSQ43A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now he that seeks to
    borrow from a usurer gives him an occasion of sin. Therefore he is not to be
    excused on account of any temporal advantage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it seems no less necessary sometimes to
    deposit one's money with a usurer than to borrow from him. Now it seems
    altogether unlawful to deposit one's money with a usurer, even as it would
    be unlawful to deposit one's sword with a madman, a maiden with a libertine,
    or food with a glutton. Neither therefore is it lawful to borrow from a
    usurer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> He that suffers injury does not sin,
    according to the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 11), wherefore justice is not a mean
    between two vices, as stated in the same book (ch. 5). Now a usurer sins by
    doing an injury to the person who borrows from him under a condition of
    usury. Therefore he that accepts a loan under a condition of usury does not
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is by no means lawful to induce a man to
    sin, yet it is lawful to make use of another's sin for a good end, since
    even God uses all sin for some good, since He draws some good from every
    evil as stated in the Enchiridion (xi). Hence when Publicola asked whether
    it were lawful to make use of an oath taken by a man swearing by false gods
    (which is a manifest sin, for he gives Divine honor to them) Augustine (Ep.
    xlvii) answered that he who uses, not for a bad but for a good purpose, the
    oath of a man that swears by false gods, is a party, not to his sin of
    swearing by demons, but to his good compact whereby he kept his word. If
    however he were to induce him to swear by false gods, he would sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly we must also answer to the question in point that it is by no
    means lawful to induce a man to lend under a condition of usury: yet it is
    lawful to borrow for usury from a man who is ready to do so and is a usurer
    by profession; provided the borrower have a good end in view, such as the
    relief of his own or another's need. Thus too it is lawful for a man who has
    fallen among thieves to point out his property to them (which they sin in
    taking) in order to save his life, after the example of the ten men who said
    to Ismahel (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++41%3A8"
      >Jer. 41:8</a
    >): "Kill us not: for we have stores in the field."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> He who borrows for usury does not
    consent to the usurer's sin but makes use of it. Nor is it the usurer's
    acceptance of usury that pleases him, but his lending, which is good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> He who borrows for usury gives the
    usurer an occasion, not for taking usury, but for lending; it is the usurer
    who finds an occasion of sin in the malice of his heart. Hence there is
    passive scandal on his part, while there is no active scandal on the part of
    the person who seeks to borrow. Nor is this passive scandal a reason why the
    other person should desist from borrowing if he is in need, since this
    passive scandal arises not from weakness or ignorance but from malice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If one were to entrust one's money to a
    usurer lacking other means of practising usury; or with the intention of
    making a greater profit from his money by reason of the usury, one would be
    giving a sinner matter for sin, so that one would be a participator in his
    guilt. If, on the other hand, the usurer to whom one entrusts one's money
    has other means of practising usury, there is no sin in entrusting it to him
    that it may be in safer keeping, since this is to use a sinner for a good
    purpose.<br />
