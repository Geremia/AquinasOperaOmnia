  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether gluttony is a sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that gluttony is not a sin. For our
    Lord said (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++15%3A11"
      >Mt. 15:11</a
    >): "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man." Now gluttony
    regards food which goes into a man. Therefore, since every sin defiles a
    man, it seems that gluttony is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "No man sins in what he cannot avoid"
    [*Ep. lxxi, ad Lucin.]. Now gluttony is immoderation in food; and man cannot
    avoid this, for Gregory says (Moral. xxx, 18): "Since in eating pleasure and
    necessity go together, we fail to discern between the call of necessity and
    the seduction of pleasure," and Augustine says (Confess. x, 31): "Who is it,
    Lord, that does not eat a little more than necessary?" Therefore gluttony is
    not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in every kind of sin the first movement
    is a sin. But the first movement in taking food is not a sin, else hunger
    and thirst would be sinful. Therefore gluttony is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xxx, 18) that "unless we
    first tame the enemy dwelling within us, namely our gluttonous appetite, we
    have not even stood up to engage in the spiritual combat." But man's inward
    enemy is sin. Therefore gluttony is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Gluttony denotes, not any desire of eating and
    drinking, but an inordinate desire. Now desire is said to be inordinate
    through leaving the order of reason, wherein the good of moral virtue
    consists: and a thing is said to be a sin through being contrary to virtue.
    Wherefore it is evident that gluttony is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That which goes into man by way of food,
    by reason of its substance and nature, does not defile a man spiritually.
    But the Jews, against whom our Lord is speaking, and the Manichees deemed
    certain foods to make a man unclean, not on account of their signification,
    but by reason of their nature [*Cf. FS, Question [102], Article [6], ad 1].
    It is the inordinate desire of food that defiles a man spiritually.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above, the vice of gluttony
    does not regard the substance of food, but in the desire thereof not being
    regulated by reason. Wherefore if a man exceed in quantity of food, not from
    desire of food, but through deeming it necessary to him, this pertains, not
    to gluttony, but to some kind of inexperience. It is a case of gluttony only
    when a man knowingly exceeds the measure in eating, from a desire for the
    pleasures of the palate.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The appetite is twofold. There is the
    natural appetite, which belongs to the powers of the vegetal soul. In these
    powers virtue and vice are impossible, since they cannot be subject to
    reason; wherefore the appetitive power is differentiated from the powers of
    secretion, digestion, and excretion, and to it hunger and thirst are to be
    referred. Besides this there is another, the sensitive appetite, and it is
    in the concupiscence of this appetite that the vice of gluttony consists.
    Hence the first movement of gluttony denotes inordinateness in the sensitive
    appetite, and this is not without sin.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether gluttony is a mortal sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that gluttony is not a mortal sin.
    For every mortal sin is contrary to a precept of the Decalogue: and this,
    apparently, does not apply to gluttony. Therefore gluttony is not a mortal
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every mortal sin is contrary to charity,
    as stated above (<a href="SS132.html#SSQ132OUTP1">Question [132]</a>,
    <a href="SS132.html#SSQ132A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But gluttony is not
    opposed to charity, neither as regards the love of God, nor as regards the
    love of one's neighbor. Therefore gluttony is never a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says in a sermon on Purgatory
    [*Cf. Append. to St. Augustine's works: Serm. civ (xli, de sanctis)]:
    "Whenever a man takes more meat and drink than is necessary, he should know
    that this is one of the lesser sins." But this pertains to gluttony.
    Therefore gluttony is accounted among the lesser, that is to say venial,
    sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> On the contrary, Gregory says (Moral. xxx, 18):
    "As long as the vice of gluttony has a hold on a man, all that he has done
    valiantly is forfeited by him: and as long as the belly is unrestrained, all
    virtue comes to naught." But virtue is not done away save by mortal sin.
    Therefore gluttony is a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS148.html#SSQ148A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), the vice of gluttony properly consists in inordinate concupiscence. Now
    the order of reason in regulating the concupiscence may be considered from
    two points of view. First, with regard to things directed to the end,
    inasmuch as they may be incommensurate and consequently improportionate to
    the end; secondly, with regard to the end itself, inasmuch as concupiscence
    turns man away from his due end. Accordingly, if the inordinate
    concupiscence in gluttony be found to turn man away from the last end,
    gluttony will be a mortal sin. This is the case when he adheres to the
    pleasure of gluttony as his end, for the sake of which he condemns God,
    being ready to disobey God's commandments, in order to obtain those
    pleasures. On the other hand, if the inordinate concupiscence in the vice of
    gluttony be found to affect only such things as are directed to the end, for
    instance when a man has too great a desire for the pleasures of the palate,
    yet would not for their sake do anything contrary to God's law, it is a
    venial sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The vice of gluttony becomes a mortal
    sin by turning man away from his last end: and accordingly, by a kind of
    reduction, it is opposed to the precept of hallowing the sabbath, which
    commands us to rest in our last end. For mortal sins are not all directly
    opposed to the precepts of the Decalogue, but only those which contain
    injustice: because the precepts of the Decalogue pertain specially to
    justice and its parts, as stated above (<a href="SS122.html#SSQ122OUTP1"
      >Question [122]</a
    >, <a href="SS122.html#SSQ122A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In so far as it turns man away from his
    last end, gluttony is opposed to the love of God, who is to be loved, as our
    last end, above all things: and only in this respect is gluttony a mortal
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This saying of Augustine refers to
    gluttony as denoting inordinate concupiscence merely in regard of things
    directed to the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Gluttony is said to bring virtue to
    naught, not so much on its own account, as on account of the vices which
    arise from it. For Gregory says (Pastor. iii, 19): "When the belly is
    distended by gluttony, the virtues of the soul are destroyed by lust."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether gluttony is the greatest of sins?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that gluttony is the greatest of
    sins. For the grievousness of a sin is measured by the grievousness of the
    punishment. Now the sin of gluttony is most grievously punished, for
    Chrysostom says [*Hom. xiii in Matth.]: "Gluttony turned Adam out of
    Paradise, gluttony it was that drew down the deluge at the time of Noah."
    According to Ezech. 16:49, "This was the iniquity of Sodom, thy sister...
    fulness of bread," etc. Therefore the sin of gluttony is the greatest of
    all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in every genus the cause is the most
    powerful. Now gluttony is apparently the cause of other sins, for a gloss on
    Ps. 135:10, "Who smote Egypt with their first-born," says: "Lust,
    concupiscence, pride are the first-born of gluttony." Therefore gluttony is
    the greatest of sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man should love himself in the first
    place after God, as stated above (<a href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1"
      >Question [25]</a
    >, <a href="SS025.html#SSQ25A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now man, by the vice
    of gluttony, inflicts an injury on himself: for it is written (Ecclus.
    37:34): "By surfeiting many have perished." Therefore gluttony is the
    greatest of sins, at least excepting those that are against God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The sins of the flesh, among which gluttony
    is reckoned, are less culpable according to Gregory (Moral. xxxiii).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The gravity of a sin may be measured in three
    ways. First and foremost it depends on the matter in which the sin is
    committed: and in this way sins committed in connection with Divine things
    are the greatest. From this point of view gluttony is not the greatest sin,
    for it is about matters connected with the nourishment of the body.
    Secondly, the gravity of a sin depends on the person who sins, and from this
    point of view the sin of gluttony is diminished rather than aggravated, both
    on account of the necessity of taking food, and on account of the difficulty
    of proper discretion and moderation in such matters. Thirdly, from the point
    of view of the result that follows, and in this way gluttony has a certain
    gravity, inasmuch as certain sins are occasioned thereby.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These punishments are to be referred to
    the vices that resulted from gluttony, or to the root from which gluttony
    sprang, rather than to gluttony itself. For the first man was expelled from
    Paradise on account of pride, from which he went on to an act of gluttony:
    while the deluge and the punishment of the people of Sodom were inflicted
    for sins occasioned by gluttony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This objection argues from the
    standpoint of the sins that result from gluttony. Nor is a cause necessarily
    more powerful, unless it be a direct cause: and gluttony is not the direct
    cause but the accidental cause, as it were, and the occasion of other
    vices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The glutton intends, not the harm to his
    body, but the pleasure of eating: and if injury results to his body, this is
    accidental. Hence this does not directly affect the gravity of gluttony, the
    guilt of which is nevertheless aggravated, if a man incur some bodily injury
    through taking too much food.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the species of gluttony are fittingly distinguished?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the species of gluttony are
    unfittingly distinguished by Gregory who says (Moral. xxx, 18): "The vice of
    gluttony tempts us in five ways. Sometimes it forestalls the hour of need;
    sometimes it seeks costly meats; sometimes it requires the food to be
    daintily cooked; sometimes it exceeds the measure of refreshment by taking
    too much; sometimes we sin by the very heat of an immoderate
    appetite"---which are contained in the following verse: "Hastily,
    sumptuously, too much, greedily, daintily."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    For the above are distinguished according to diversity of circumstance. Now
    circumstances, being the accidents of an act, do not differentiate its
    species. Therefore the species of gluttony are not distinguished according
    to the aforesaid.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as time is a circumstance, so is place.
    If then gluttony admits of one species in respect of time, it seems that
    there should likewise be others in respect of place and other
    circumstances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as temperance observes due
    circumstances, so do the other moral virtues. Now the species of the vices
    opposed to the other moral virtues are not distinguished according to
    various circumstances. Neither, therefore, are the species of gluttony
    distinguished thus.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the authority of Gregory quoted above.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS148.html#SSQ148A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), gluttony denotes inordinate concupiscence in eating. Now two things are
    to be considered in eating, namely the food we eat, and the eating thereof.
    Accordingly, the inordinate concupiscence may be considered in two ways.
    First, with regard to the food consumed: and thus, as regards the substance
    or species of food a man seeks "sumptuous"---i.e. costly food; as regards
    its quality, he seeks food prepared too nicely---i.e. "daintily"; and as
    regards quantity, he exceeds by eating "too much."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, the inordinate concupiscence is considered as to the consumption
    of food: either because one forestalls the proper time for eating, which is
    to eat "hastily," or one fails to observe the due manner of eating, by
    eating "greedily."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Isidore [*De Summo Bon. ii, 42] comprises the first and second under one
    heading, when he says that the glutton exceeds in "what" he eats, or in "how
    much," "how" or "when he eats."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The corruption of various circumstances
    causes the various species of gluttony, on account of the various motives,
    by reason of which the species of moral things are differentiated. For in
    him that seeks sumptuous food, concupiscence is aroused by the very species
    of the food; in him that forestalls the time concupiscence is disordered
    through impatience of delay, and so forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Place and other circumstances include no
    special motive connected with eating, that can cause a different species of
    gluttony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In all other vices, whenever different
    circumstances correspond to different motives, the difference of
    circumstances argues a specific difference of vice: but this does not apply
    to all circumstances, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,

  <h3 align="left">Whether gluttony is a capital vice?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that gluttony is not a capital
    vice. For capital vices denote those whence, under the aspect of final
    cause, other vices originate. Now food, which is the matter of gluttony, has
    not the aspect of end, since it is sought, not for its own sake, but for the
    body's nourishment. Therefore gluttony is not a capital vice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a capital vice would seem to have a
    certain pre-eminence in sinfulness. But this does not apply to gluttony,
    which, in respect of its genus, is apparently the least of sins, seeing that
    it is most akin to what is in respect of its genus, is apparently the least
    gluttony is not a capital vice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sin results from a man forsaking the
    food of virtue on account of something useful to the present life, or
    pleasing to the senses. Now as regards goods having the aspect of utility,
    there is but one capital vice, namely covetousness. Therefore, seemingly,
    there would be but one capital vice in respect of pleasures: and this is
    lust, which is a greater vice than gluttony, and is about greater pleasures.
    Therefore gluttony is not a capital vice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45) reckons gluttony
    among the capital vices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), a capital vice
    denotes one from which, considered as final cause, i.e. as having a most
    desirable end, other vices originate: wherefore through desiring that end
    men are incited to sin in many ways. Now an end is rendered most desirable
    through having one of the conditions of happiness which is desirable by its
    very nature: and pleasure is essential to happiness, according to Ethic. i,
    8; x, 3,7,8. Therefore the vice of gluttony, being about pleasures of touch
    which stand foremost among other pleasures, is fittingly reckoned among the
    capital vices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is true that food itself is directed
    to something as its end: but since that end, namely the sustaining of life,
    is most desirable and whereas life cannot be sustained without food, it
    follows that food too is most desirable: indeed, nearly all the toil of
    man's life is directed thereto, according to Eccles. 6:7, "All the labor of
    man is for his mouth." Yet gluttony seems to be about pleasures of food
    rather than about food itself; wherefore, as Augustine says (De Vera Relig.
    liii), "with such food as is good for the worthless body, men desire to be
    fed," wherein namely the pleasure consists, "rather than to be filled: since
    the whole end of that desire is this---not to thirst and not to hunger."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In sin the end is ascertained with
    respect to the conversion, while the gravity of sin is determined with
    regard to the aversion. Wherefore it does not follow that the capital sin
    which has the most desirable end surpasses the others in gravity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That which gives pleasure is desirable
    in itself: and consequently corresponding to its diversity there are two
    capital vices, namely gluttony and lust. On the other hand, that which is
    useful is desirable, not in itself, but as directed to something else:
    wherefore seemingly in all useful things there is one aspect of
    desirability. Hence there is but one capital vice, in respect of such
    things.<br />

    Whether six daughters are fittingly assigned to gluttony?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that six daughters are unfittingly
    assigned to gluttony, to wit, "unseemly joy, scurrility, uncleanness,
    loquaciousness, and dullness of mind as regards the understanding." For
    unseemly joy results from every sin, according to Prov. 2:14, "Who are glad
    when they have done evil, and rejoice in most wicked things." Likewise
    dullness of mind is associated with every sin, according to Prov. 14:22,
    "They err that work evil." Therefore they are unfittingly reckoned to be
    daughters of gluttony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the uncleanness which is particularly
    the result of gluttony would seem to be connected with vomiting, according
    to Is. 28:8, "All tables were full of vomit and filth." But this seems to be
    not a sin but a punishment; or even a useful thing that is a matter of
    counsel, according to Ecclus. 31:25, "If thou hast been forced to eat much,
    arise, go out, and vomit; and it shall refresh thee." Therefore it should
    not be reckoned among the daughters of gluttony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Isidore (Questions. in Deut. xvi)
    reckons scurrility as a daughter of lust. Therefore it should not be
    reckoned among the daughters of gluttony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45) assigns these
    daughters to gluttony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS148.html#SSQ148ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,2,3), gluttony consists properly in an immoderate pleasure in eating and
    drinking. Wherefore those vices are reckoned among the daughters of
    gluttony, which are the results of eating and drinking immoderately. These
    may be accounted for either on the part of the soul or on the part of the
    body. on the part of the soul these results are of four kinds. First, as
    regards the reason, whose keenness is dulled by immoderate meat and drink,
    and in this respect we reckon as a daughter of gluttony, "dullness of sense
    in the understanding," on account of the fumes of food disturbing the brain.
    Even so, on the other hand, abstinence conduces to the penetrating power of
    wisdom, according to Eccles. 2:3, "I thought in my heart to withdraw my
    flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind in wisdom." Secondly, as regards
    the. appetite, which is disordered in many ways by immoderation in eating
    and drinking, as though reason were fast asleep at the helm, and in this
    respect "unseemly joy" is reckoned, because all the other inordinate
    passions are directed to joy or sorrow, as stated in Ethic. ii, 5. To this
    we must refer the saying of 3 Esdra 3:20, that "wine... gives every one a
    confident and joyful mind." Thirdly, as regards inordinate words, and thus
    we have "loquaciousness," because as Gregory says (Pastor. iii, 19), "unless
    gluttons were carried away by immoderate speech, that rich man who is stated
    to have feasted sumptuously every day would not have been so tortured in his
    tongue." Fourthly, as regards inordinate action, and in this way we have
    "scurrility," i.e. a kind of levity resulting from lack of reason, which is
    unable not only to bridle the speech, but also to restrain outward behavior.
    Hence a gloss on Eph. 5:4, "Or foolish talking or scurrility," says that
    "fools call this geniality---i.e. jocularity, because it is wont to raise a
    laugh." Both of these, however, may be referred to the words which may
    happen to be sinful, either by reason of excess which belongs to
    "loquaciousness," or by reason of unbecomingness, which belongs to
    "scurrility."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the part of the body, mention is made of "uncleanness," which may refer
    either to the inordinate emission of any kind of superfluities, or
    especially to the emission of the semen. Hence a gloss on Eph. 5:3, "But
    fornication and all uncleanness," says: "That is, any kind of incontinence
    that has reference to lust."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Joy in the act or end of sin results
    from every sin, especially the sin that proceeds from habit, but the random
    riotous joy which is described as "unseemly" arises chiefly from immoderate
    partaking of meat or drink. In like manner, we reply that dullness of sense
    as regards matters of choice is common to all sin, whereas dullness of sense
    in speculative matters arises chiefly from gluttony, for the reason given
    above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although it does one good to vomit after
    eating too much, yet it is sinful to expose oneself to its necessity by
    immoderate meat or drink. However, it is no sin to procure vomiting as a
    remedy for sickness if the physician prescribes it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Scurrility proceeds from the act of
    gluttony, and not from the lustful act, but from the lustful will: wherefore
    it may be referred to either vice.<br />
