<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that gluttony is not a sin. For our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++15%3A11">Mt. 15:11</a>): "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man." Now 
gluttony regards food which goes into a man. Therefore, since every sin 
defiles a man, it seems that gluttony is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "No man sins in what he cannot avoid" [*Ep. lxxi, ad 
Lucin.]. Now gluttony is immoderation in food; and man cannot avoid this, 
for Gregory says (Moral. xxx, 18): "Since in eating pleasure and 
necessity go together, we fail to discern between the call of necessity 
and the seduction of pleasure," and Augustine says (Confess. x, 31): "Who 
is it, Lord, that does not eat a little more than necessary?" Therefore 
gluttony is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in every kind of sin the first movement is a sin. But 
the first movement in taking food is not a sin, else hunger and thirst 
would be sinful. Therefore gluttony is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xxx, 18) that "unless we first 
tame the enemy dwelling within us, namely our gluttonous appetite, we 
have not even stood up to engage in the spiritual combat." But man's 
inward enemy is sin. Therefore gluttony is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Gluttony denotes, not any desire of eating and drinking, 
but an inordinate desire. Now desire is said to be inordinate through 
leaving the order of reason, wherein the good of moral virtue consists: 
and a thing is said to be a sin through being contrary to virtue. 
Wherefore it is evident that gluttony is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That which goes into man by way of food, by reason of its 
substance and nature, does not defile a man spiritually. But the Jews, 
against whom our Lord is speaking, and the Manichees deemed certain foods 
to make a man unclean, not on account of their signification, but by 
reason of their nature [*Cf. FS, Question [102], Article [6], ad 1]. It is the 
inordinate desire of food that defiles a man spiritually.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above, the vice of gluttony does not regard the 
substance of food, but in the desire thereof not being regulated by 
reason. Wherefore if a man exceed in quantity of food, not from desire of 
food, but through deeming it necessary to him, this pertains, not to 
gluttony, but to some kind of inexperience. It is a case of gluttony only 
when a man knowingly exceeds the measure in eating, from a desire for the 
pleasures of the palate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The appetite is twofold. There is the natural appetite, 
which belongs to the powers of the vegetal soul. In these powers virtue 
and vice are impossible, since they cannot be subject to reason; 
wherefore the appetitive power is differentiated from the powers of 
secretion, digestion, and excretion, and to it hunger and thirst are to 
be referred. Besides this there is another, the sensitive appetite, and 
it is in the concupiscence of this appetite that the vice of gluttony 
consists. Hence the first movement of gluttony denotes inordinateness in 
the sensitive appetite, and this is not without sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether gluttony is a mortal sin? <br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that gluttony is not a mortal sin. For every mortal 
sin is contrary to a precept of the Decalogue: and this, apparently, does 
not apply to gluttony. Therefore gluttony is not a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every mortal sin is contrary to charity, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS132.html#SSQ132OUTP1">Question [132]</a>, <A Href="SS132.html#SSQ132A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But gluttony is not opposed to charity, neither as 
regards the love of God, nor as regards the love of one's neighbor. 
Therefore gluttony is never a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says in a sermon on Purgatory [*Cf. Append. to 
St. Augustine's works: Serm. civ (xli, de sanctis)]: "Whenever a man 
takes more meat and drink than is necessary, he should know that this is 
one of the lesser sins." But this pertains to gluttony. Therefore 
gluttony is accounted among the lesser, that is to say venial, sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> On the contrary, Gregory says (Moral. xxx, 18): "As long as the 
vice of gluttony has a hold on a man, all that he has done valiantly is 
forfeited by him: and as long as the belly is unrestrained, all virtue 
comes to naught." But virtue is not done away save by mortal sin. 
Therefore gluttony is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS148.html#SSQ148A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the vice of gluttony properly 
consists in inordinate concupiscence. Now the order of reason in 
regulating the concupiscence may be considered from two points of view. 
First, with regard to things directed to the end, inasmuch as they may be 
incommensurate and consequently improportionate to the end; secondly, 
with regard to the end itself, inasmuch as concupiscence turns man away 
from his due end. Accordingly, if the inordinate concupiscence in 
gluttony be found to turn man away from the last end, gluttony will be a 
mortal sin. This is the case when he adheres to the pleasure of gluttony 
as his end, for the sake of which he contemns God, being ready to disobey 
God's commandments, in order to obtain those pleasures. On the other 
hand, if the inordinate concupiscence in the vice of gluttony be found to 
affect only such things as are directed to the end, for instance when a 
man has too great a desire for the pleasures of the palate, yet would not 
for their sake do anything contrary to God's law, it is a venial sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The vice of gluttony becomes a mortal sin by turning man 
away from his last end: and accordingly, by a kind of reduction, it is 
opposed to the precept of hallowing the sabbath, which commands us to 
rest in our last end. For mortal sins are not all directly opposed to the 
precepts of the Decalogue, but only those which contain injustice: 
because the precepts of the Decalogue pertain specially to justice and 
its parts, as stated above (<A Href="SS122.html#SSQ122OUTP1">Question [122]</a>, <A Href="SS122.html#SSQ122A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In so far as it turns man away from his last end, gluttony 
is opposed to the love of God, who is to be loved, as our last end, above 
all things: and only in this respect is gluttony a  mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This saying of Augustine refers to gluttony as denoting 
inordinate concupiscence merely in regard of things directed to the end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Gluttony is said to bring virtue to naught, not so much on 
its own account, as on account of the vices which arise from it. For 
Gregory says (Pastor. iii, 19): "When the belly is distended by gluttony, 
the virtues of the soul are destroyed by lust."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether gluttony is the greatest of sins?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that gluttony is the greatest of sins. For the 
grievousness of a sin is measured by the grievousness of the punishment. 
Now the sin of gluttony is most grievously punished, for Chrysostom says 
[*Hom. xiii in Matth.]: "Gluttony turned Adam out of Paradise, gluttony 
it was that drew down the deluge at the time of Noah." According to 
Ezech. 16:49, "This was the iniquity of Sodom, thy sister . . . fulness 
of bread," etc. Therefore the sin of gluttony is the greatest of all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in every genus the cause is the most powerful. Now 
gluttony is apparently the cause of other sins, for a gloss on Ps. 
135:10, "Who smote Egypt with their first-born," says: "Lust, 
concupiscence, pride are the first-born of gluttony." Therefore gluttony 
is the greatest of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man should love himself in the first place after God, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now man, by the vice of gluttony, inflicts an 
injury on himself: for it is written (Ecclus. 37:34): "By surfeiting many 
have perished." Therefore gluttony is the greatest of sins, at least 
excepting those that are against God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The sins of the flesh, among which gluttony is 
reckoned, are less culpable according to Gregory (Moral. xxxiii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The gravity of a sin may be measured in three ways. First 
and foremost it depends on the matter in which the sin is committed: and 
in this way sins committed in connection with Divine things are the 
greatest. From this point of view gluttony is not the greatest sin, for 
it is about matters connected with the nourishment of the body. Secondly, 
the gravity of a sin depends on the person who sins, and from this point 
of view the sin of gluttony is diminished rather than aggravated, both on 
account of the necessity of taking food, and on account of the difficulty 
of proper discretion and moderation in such matters. Thirdly, from the 
point of view of the result that follows, and in this way gluttony has a 
certain gravity, inasmuch as certain sins are occasioned thereby. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These punishments are to be referred to the vices that 
resulted from gluttony, or to the root from which gluttony sprang, rather 
than to gluttony itself. For the first man was expelled from Paradise on 
account of pride, from which he went on to an act of gluttony: while the 
deluge and the punishment of the people of Sodom were inflicted for sins 
occasioned by gluttony.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This objection argues from the standpoint of the sins that 
result from gluttony. Nor is a cause necessarily more powerful, unless it 
be a direct cause: and gluttony is not the direct cause but the 
accidental cause, as it were, and the occasion of other vices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The glutton intends, not the harm to his body, but the 
pleasure of eating: and if injury results to his body, this is 
accidental. Hence this does not directly affect the gravity of gluttony, 
the guilt of which is nevertheless aggravated, if a man incur some bodily 
injury through taking too much food.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the species of gluttony are fittingly distinguished?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the species of gluttony are unfittingly 
distinguished by Gregory who says (Moral. xxx, 18): "The vice of gluttony 
tempts us in five ways. Sometimes it forestalls the hour of need; 
sometimes it seeks costly meats; sometimes it requires the food to be 
daintily cooked; sometimes it exceeds the measure of refreshment by 
taking too much; sometimes we sin by the very heat of an immoderate 
appetite"---which are contained in the following verse: "Hastily, 
sumptuously, too much, greedily, daintily."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the above are distinguished according to diversity of circumstance. 
Now circumstances, being the accidents of an act, do not differentiate 
its species. Therefore the species of gluttony are not distinguished 
according to the aforesaid.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as time is a circumstance, so is place. If then gluttony 
admits of one species in respect of time, it seems that there should 
likewise be others in respect of place and other circumstances.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as temperance observes due circumstances, so do the 
other moral virtues. Now the species of the vices opposed to the other 
moral virtues are not distinguished according to various circumstances. 
Neither, therefore, are the species of gluttony distinguished thus.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the authority of Gregory quoted above.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS148.html#SSQ148A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), gluttony denotes inordinate 
concupiscence in eating. Now two things are to be considered in eating, 
namely the food we eat, and the eating thereof. Accordingly, the 
inordinate concupiscence may be  considered in two ways. First, with 
regard to the food consumed: and thus, as regards the substance or 
species of food a man seeks "sumptuous"---i.e. costly food; as regards 
its quality, he seeks food prepared too nicely---i.e. "daintily"; and as 
regards quantity, he exceeds by eating "too much."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the inordinate concupiscence is considered as to the 
consumption of food: either because one forestalls the proper time for 
eating, which is to eat "hastily," or one fails to observe the due manner 
of eating, by eating "greedily."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Isidore [*De Summo Bon. ii, 42] comprises the first and second under one 
heading, when he says that the glutton exceeds in "what" he eats, or in 
"how much," "how" or "when he eats."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The corruption of various circumstances causes the various 
species of gluttony, on account of the various motives, by reason of 
which the species of moral things are differentiated. For in him that 
seeks sumptuous food, concupiscence is aroused by the very species of the 
food; in him that forestalls the time concupiscence is disordered through 
impatience of delay, and so forth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Place and other circumstances include no special motive 
connected with eating, that can cause a different species of gluttony.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In all other vices, whenever different circumstances 
correspond to different motives, the difference of circumstances argues a 
specific difference of vice: but this does not apply to all 
circumstances, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>).<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that gluttony is not a capital vice. For capital 
vices denote those whence, under the aspect of final cause, other vices 
originate. Now food, which is the matter of gluttony, has not the aspect 
of end, since it is sought, not for its own sake, but for the body's 
nourishment. Therefore gluttony is not a capital vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a capital vice would seem to have a certain pre-eminence 
in sinfulness. But this does not apply to gluttony, which, in respect of 
its genus, is apparently the least of sins, seeing that it is most akin 
to what is in respect of its genus, is apparently the least gluttony is 
not a capital vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sin results from a man forsaking the food of virtue on 
account of something useful to the present life, or pleasing to the 
senses. Now as regards goods having the aspect of utility, there is but 
one capital vice, namely covetousness. Therefore, seemingly, there would 
be but one capital vice in respect of pleasures: and this is lust, which 
is a greater vice  than gluttony, and is about greater pleasures. 
Therefore gluttony is not a capital vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45) reckons gluttony among the 
capital vices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), a capital vice denotes 
one from which, considered as final cause, i.e. as having a most 
desirable end, other vices originate: wherefore through desiring that end 
men are incited to sin in many ways. Now an end is rendered most 
desirable through having one of the conditions of happiness which is 
desirable by its very nature: and pleasure is essential to happiness, 
according to Ethic. i, 8; x, 3,7,8. Therefore the vice of gluttony, being 
about pleasures of touch which stand foremost among other pleasures, is 
fittingly reckoned among the capital vices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is true that food itself is directed to something as its 
end: but since that end, namely the sustaining of life, is most desirable 
and whereas life cannot be sustained without food, it follows that food 
too is most desirable: indeed, nearly all the toil of man's life is 
directed thereto, according to Eccles. 6:7, "All the labor of man is for 
his mouth." Yet gluttony seems to be about pleasures of food rather than 
about food itself; wherefore, as Augustine says (De Vera Relig. liii), 
"with such food as is good for the worthless body, men desire to be fed," 
wherein namely the pleasure consists, "rather than to be filled: since 
the whole end of that desire is this---not to thirst and not to hunger."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In sin the end is ascertained with respect to the 
conversion, while the gravity of sin is determined with regard to the 
aversion. Wherefore it does not follow that the capital sin which has the 
most desirable end surpasses the others in gravity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That which gives pleasure is desirable in itself: and 
consequently corresponding to its diversity there are two capital vices, 
namely gluttony and lust. On the other hand, that which is useful is 
desirable, not in itself, but as directed to something else: wherefore 
seemingly in all useful things there is one aspect of desirability. Hence 
there is but one capital vice, in respect of such things.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether six daughters are fittingly assigned to gluttony?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that six daughters are unfittingly assigned to 
gluttony, to wit, "unseemly joy, scurrility, uncleanness, loquaciousness, 
and dullness of mind as regards the understanding." For unseemly joy 
results from every sin, according to Prov. 2:14, "Who are glad when they 
have done evil, and rejoice in most wicked things." Likewise dullness of 
mind is associated with every sin, according to Prov. 14:22, "They err 
that work evil." Therefore they are unfittingly reckoned to be daughters 
of  gluttony.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the uncleanness which is particularly the result of 
gluttony would seem to be connected with vomiting, according to Is. 28:8, 
"All tables were full of vomit and filth." But this seems to be not a sin 
but a punishment; or even a useful thing that is a matter of counsel, 
according to Ecclus. 31:25, "If thou hast been forced to eat much, arise, 
go out, and vomit; and it shall refresh thee." Therefore it should not be 
reckoned among the daughters of gluttony.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Isidore (Questions. in Deut. xvi) reckons scurrility as a 
daughter of lust. Therefore it should not be reckoned among the daughters 
of gluttony.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45) assigns these daughters to 
gluttony.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS148.html#SSQ148ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2,3), gluttony consists properly 
in an immoderate pleasure in eating and drinking. Wherefore those vices 
are reckoned among the daughters of gluttony, which are the results of 
eating and drinking immoderately. These may be accounted for either on 
the part of the soul or on the part of the body. on the part of the soul 
these results are of four kinds. First, as regards the reason, whose 
keenness is dulled by immoderate meat and drink, and in this respect we 
reckon as a daughter of gluttony, "dullness of sense in the 
understanding," on account of the fumes of food disturbing the brain. 
Even so, on the other hand, abstinence conduces to the penetrating power 
of wisdom, according to Eccles. 2:3, "I thought in my heart to withdraw 
my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind in wisdom." Secondly, as 
regards the. appetite, which is disordered in many ways by immoderation 
in eating and drinking, as though reason were fast asleep at the helm, 
and in this respect "unseemly joy" is reckoned, because all the other 
inordinate passions are directed to joy or sorrow, as stated in Ethic. 
ii, 5. To this we must refer the saying of 3 Esdra 3:20, that "wine . . . 
gives every one a confident and joyful mind." Thirdly, as regards 
inordinate words, and thus we have "loquaciousness," because as Gregory 
says (Pastor. iii, 19), "unless gluttons were carried away by immoderate 
speech, that rich man who is stated to have feasted sumptuously every day 
would not have been so tortured in his tongue." Fourthly, as regards 
inordinate action, and in this way we have "scurrility," i.e. a kind of 
levity resulting from lack of reason, which is unable not only to bridle 
the speech, but also to restrain outward behavior. Hence a gloss on Eph. 
5:4, "Or foolish talking or scurrility," says that "fools call this 
geniality---i.e. jocularity, because it is wont to raise a laugh." Both 
of these, however, may be referred to the words which may happen to be 
sinful, either by reason of excess which belongs to "loquaciousness," or 
by reason of unbecomingness, which belongs to "scurrility."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the part of the body, mention is made of "uncleanness," which may 
refer either to the inordinate emission of any kind of  superfluities, or 
especially to the emission of the semen. Hence a gloss on Eph. 5:3, "But 
fornication and all uncleanness," says: "That is, any kind of 
incontinence that has reference to lust."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Joy in the act or end of sin results from every sin, 
especially the sin that proceeds from habit, but the random riotous joy 
which is described as "unseemly" arises chiefly from immoderate partaking 
of meat or drink. In like manner, we reply that dullness of sense as 
regards matters of choice is common to all sin, whereas dullness of sense 
in speculative matters arises chiefly from gluttony, for the reason given 
above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although it does one good to vomit after eating too much, 
yet it is sinful to expose oneself to its necessity by immoderate meat or 
drink. However, it is no sin to procure vomiting as a remedy for sickness 
if the physician prescribes it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[148] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Scurrility proceeds from the act of gluttony, and not from 
the lustful act, but from the lustful will: wherefore it may be referred 
to either vice.<br>
