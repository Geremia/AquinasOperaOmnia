<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that incontinence pertains not to the soul but to 
the body. For sexual diversity comes not from the soul but from the body. 
Now sexual diversity causes diversity of incontinence: for the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 5) that women are not described either as 
continent or as incontinent. Therefore incontinence pertains not to the 
soul but to the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which pertains to the soul does not  result from 
the temperament of the body. But incontinence results from the bodily 
temperament: for the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that "it is 
especially people of a quick or choleric and atrabilious temper whose 
incontinence is one of unbridled desire." Therefore incontinence regards 
the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, victory concerns the victor rather than the vanquished. 
Now a man is said to be incontinent, because "the flesh lusteth against 
the spirit," and overcomes it. Therefore incontinence pertains to the 
flesh rather than to the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Man differs from beast chiefly as regards the soul. Now 
they differ in respect of continence and incontinence, for we ascribe 
neither continence nor incontinence to the beasts, as the Philosopher 
states (Ethic. vii, 3). Therefore incontinence is chiefly on the part of 
the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Things are ascribed to their direct causes rather than to 
those which merely occasion them. Now that which is on the part of the 
body is merely an occasional cause of incontinence; since it is owing to 
a bodily disposition that vehement passions can arise in the sensitive 
appetite which is a power of the organic body. Yet these passions, 
however vehement they be, are not the sufficient cause of incontinence, 
but are merely the occasion thereof, since, so long as the use of reason 
remains, man is always able to resist his passions. If, however, the 
passions gain such strength as to take away the use of reason 
altogether---as in the case of those who become insane through the 
vehemence of their passions---the essential conditions of continence or 
incontinence cease, because such people do not retain the judgment of 
reason, which the continent man follows and the incontinent forsakes. 
From this it follows that the direct cause of incontinence is on the part 
of the soul, which fails to resist a passion by the reason. This happens 
in two ways, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 7): first, when 
the soul yields to the passions, before the reason has given its counsel; 
and this is called "unbridled incontinence" or "impetuosity": secondly, 
when a man does not stand to what has been counselled, through holding 
weakly to reason's judgment; wherefore this kind of incontinence is 
called "weakness." Hence it is manifest that incontinence pertains 
chiefly to the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The human soul is the form of the body, and has certain 
powers which make use of bodily organs. The operations of these organs 
conduce somewhat to those operations of the soul which are accomplished 
without bodily instruments, namely to the acts of the intellect and of 
the will, in so far as the intellect receives from the senses, and the 
will is urged by passions of the sensitive appetite. Accordingly, since 
woman, as regards the body, has a weak temperament, the result is that 
for the most part, whatever she holds to, she holds to it weakly; 
although in /rare cases the opposite occurs, according to Prov. 31:10, 
"Who shall find a valiant woman?" And since small and weak things "are 
accounted as though they were not" [*Aristotle, Phys. ii, 5] the 
Philosopher  speaks of women as though they had not the firm judgment of 
reason, although the contrary happens in some women. Hence he states that 
"we do not describe women as being continent, because they are 
vacillating" through being unstable of reason, and "are easily led" so 
that they follow their passions readily.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is owing to the impulse of passion that a man at once 
follows his passion before his reason counsels him. Now the impulse of 
passion may arise either from its quickness, as in bilious persons [*Cf. 
FS, Question [46], Article [5]], or from its vehemence, as in the melancholic, who on 
account of their earthy temperament are most vehemently aroused. Even so, 
on the other hand, a man fails to stand to that which is counselled, 
because he holds to it in weakly fashion by reason of the softness of his 
temperament, as we have stated with regard to woman (ad 1). This is also 
the case with phlegmatic temperaments, for the same reason as in women. 
And these results are due to the fact that the bodily temperament is an 
occasional but not a sufficient cause of incontinence, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the incontinent man concupiscence of the flesh overcomes 
the spirit, not necessarily, but through a certain negligence of the 
spirit in not resisting strongly.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether incontinence is a sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that incontinence is not a sin. For as Augustine 
says (De Lib. Arb. iii, 18): "No man sins in what he cannot avoid." Now 
no man can by himself avoid incontinence, according to Wis. 8:21, "I know 
[Vulg.: 'knew'] that I could not . . . be continent, except God gave it." 
Therefore incontinence is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, apparently every sin originates in the reason. But the 
judgment of reason is overcome in the incontinent man. Therefore 
incontinence is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one sins in loving God vehemently. Now a man becomes 
incontinent through the vehemence of divine love: for Dionysius says 
(Div. Nom. iv) that "Paul, through incontinence of divine love, 
exclaimed: I live, now not I" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++2%3A20">Gal. 2:20</a>). Therefore incontinence is not 
a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is numbered together with other sins (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Tim++3%3A3">2 Tim. 3:3</a>) 
where it is written: "Slanderers, incontinent, unmerciful," etc. 
Therefore incontinence is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Incontinence about a matter may be considered in two 
ways. First it may be considered properly and simply: and thus 
incontinence is about concupiscences of pleasures of touch, even as 
intemperance is, as we have said in reference to continence (<A Href="SS155.html#SSQ155OUTP1">Question [155]</a>, <A Href="SS155.html#SSQ155A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). In this way incontinence is a sin for two reasons: first, because the 
incontinent man goes astray from that which is  in accord with reason; 
secondly, because he plunges into shameful pleasures. Hence the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 4) that "incontinence is censurable not 
only because it is wrong"---that is, by straying from reason---"but also 
because it is wicked"---that is, by following evil desires. Secondly, 
incontinence about a matter is considered, properly---inasmuch as it is a 
straying from reason---but not simply; for instance when a man does not 
observe the mode of reason in his desire for honor, riches, and so forth, 
which seem to be good in themselves. About such things there is 
incontinence, not simply but relatively, even as we have said above in 
reference to continence (<A Href="SS155.html#SSQ155OUTP1">Question [155]</a>, <A Href="SS155.html#SSQ155A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3). In this way incontinence is 
a sin, not from the fact that one gives way to wicked desires, but 
because one fails to observe the mode of reason even in the desire for 
things that are of themselves desirable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, incontinence is said to be about a matter, not properly, but 
metaphorically. for instance about the desires for things of which one 
cannot make an evil use, such as the desire for virtue. A man may be said 
to be incontinent in these matters metaphorically, because just as the 
incontinent man is entirely led by his evil desire, even so is a man 
entirely led by his good desire which is in accord with reason. Such like 
incontinence is no sin, but pertains to the perfection of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Man can avoid sin and do good, yet not without God's help, 
according to Jn. 15:5: "Without Me you can do nothing." Wherefore the 
fact that man needs God's help in order to be continent, does not show 
incontinence to be no sin, for, as stated in Ethic. iii, 3, "what we can 
do by means of a friend we do, in a way, ourselves."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The judgment of reason is overcome in the incontinent man, 
not necessarily, for then he would commit no sin, but through a certain 
negligence on account of his not standing firm in resisting the passion 
by holding to the judgment formed by his reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument takes incontinence metaphorically and not 
properly.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the incontinent man sins more gravely than the intemperate?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the incontinent man sins more gravely than the 
intemperate. For, seemingly, the more a man acts against his conscience, 
the more gravely he sins, according to Lk. 12:47, "That servant who knew 
the will of his lord . . . and did not . . . shall be beaten with many 
stripes." Now the incontinent man would seem to act against his 
conscience more than the intemperate because, according to Ethic. vii, 3, 
the incontinent man, though knowing how wicked are the things he desires, 
nevertheless acts through passion, whereas the intemperate man judges 
what he desires to be good. Therefore the incontinent man  sins more 
gravely than the intemperate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, apparently, the graver a sin is, the more incurable it 
is: wherefore the sins against the Holy Ghost, being most grave, are 
declared to be unpardonable. Now the sin of incontinence would appear to 
be more incurable than the sin of intemperance. For a person's sin is 
cured by admonishment and correction, which seemingly are no good to the 
incontinent man, since he knows he is doing wrong, and does wrong 
notwithstanding: whereas it seems to the intemperate man that he is doing 
well, so that it were good for him to be admonished. Therefore it would 
appear that the incontinent man sins more gravely than the intemperate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the more eagerly man sins, the more grievous his sin. 
Now the incontinent sins more eagerly than the intemperate, since the 
incontinent man has vehement passions and desires, which the intemperate 
man does not always have. Therefore the incontinent man sins more gravely 
than the intemperate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Impenitence aggravates every sin: wherefore Augustine 
says (De Verb. Dom. serm. xi, 12,13) that "impenitence is a sin against 
the Holy Ghost." Now according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 8) "the 
intemperate man is not inclined to be penitent, for he holds on to his 
choice: but every incontinent man is inclined to repentance." Therefore 
the intemperate man sins more gravely than the incontinent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to Augustine [*De Duab. Anim. x, xi] sin is 
chiefly an act of the will, because "by the will we sin and live aright" 
[*Retract. i, 9]. Consequently where there is a greater inclination of 
the will to sin, there is a graver sin. Now in the intemperate man, the 
will is inclined to sin in virtue of its own choice, which proceeds from 
a habit acquired through custom: whereas in the incontinent man, the will 
is inclined to sin through a passion. And since passion soon passes, 
whereas a habit is "a disposition difficult to remove," the result is 
that the incontinent man repents at once, as soon as the passion has 
passed; but not so the intemperate man; in fact he rejoices in having 
sinned, because the sinful act has become connatural to him by reason of 
his habit. Wherefore in reference to such persons it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++2%3A14">Prov. 2:14</a>) that "they are glad when they have done evil, and rejoice in most 
wicked things." Hence it follows that "the intemperate man is much worse 
than the incontinent," as also the Philosopher declares (Ethic. vii, 7).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Ignorance in the intellect sometimes precedes the 
inclination of the appetite and causes it, and then the greater the 
ignorance, the more does it diminish or entirely excuse the sin, in so 
far as it renders it involuntary. On the other hand, ignorance in the 
reason sometimes follows the inclination of the appetite, and then such 
like ignorance, the greater it is, the graver the sin, because the 
inclination of the appetite is shown thereby to be greater. Now in both 
the incontinent and the intemperate man,  ignorance arises from the 
appetite being inclined to something, either by passion, as in the 
incontinent, or by habit, as in the intemperate. Nevertheless greater 
ignorance results thus in the intemperate than in the incontinent. In one 
respect as regards duration, since in the incontinent man this ignorance 
lasts only while the passion endures, just as an attack of intermittent 
fever lasts as long as the humor is disturbed: whereas the ignorance of 
the intemperate man endures without ceasing, on account of the endurance 
of the habit, wherefore it is likened to phthisis or any chronic disease, 
as the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 8). In another respect the ignorance 
of the intemperate man is greater as regards the thing ignored. For the 
ignorance of the incontinent man regards some particular detail of choice 
(in so far as he deems that he must choose this particular thing now): 
whereas the intemperate man's ignorance is about the end itself, inasmuch 
as he judges this thing good, in order that he may follow his desires 
without being curbed. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7,8) that 
"the incontinent man is better than the intemperate, because he retains 
the best principle [*{To beltiston, e arche}, 'the best thing, i.e. the 
principle']," to wit, the right estimate of the end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Mere knowledge does not suffice to cure the incontinent 
man, for he needs the inward assistance of grace which quenches 
concupiscence, besides the application of the external remedy of 
admonishment and correction, which induce him to begin to resist his 
desires, so that concupiscence is weakened, as stated above (<A Href="SS142.html#SSQ142OUTP1">Question [142]</a>, <A Href="SS142.html#SSQ142A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). By these same means the intemperate man can be cured. But his curing 
is more difficult, for two reasons. The first is on the part of reason, 
which is corrupt as regards the estimate of the last end, which holds the 
same position as the principle in demonstrations. Now it is more 
difficult to bring back to the truth one who errs as to the principle; 
and it is the same in practical matters with one who errs in regard to 
the end. The other reason is on the part of the inclination of the 
appetite: for in the intemperate man this proceeds from a habit, which is 
difficult to remove, whereas the inclination of the incontinent man 
proceeds from a passion, which is more easily suppressed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The eagerness of the will, which increases a sin, is 
greater in the intemperate man than in the incontinent, as explained 
above. But the eagerness of concupiscence in the sensitive appetite is 
sometimes greater in the incontinent man, because he does not sin except 
through vehement concupiscence, whereas the intemperate man sins even 
through slight concupiscence and sometimes forestalls it. Hence the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that we blame more the intemperate man, 
"because he pursues pleasure without desiring it or with calm," i.e. 
slight desire. "For what would he have done if he had desired it with 
passion?"<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the incontinent in anger is worse than the 
incontinent in desire. For the more difficult it is to resist the 
passion, the less grievous, apparently is incontinence: wherefore the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7): "It is not wonderful, indeed it is 
pardonable if a person is overcome by strong and overwhelming pleasures 
or pains." Now, "as Heraclitus says, it is more difficult to resist 
desire than anger" [*Ethic. ii. 3]. Therefore incontinence of desire is 
less grievous than incontinence of anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one is altogether excused from sin if the passion be so 
vehement as to deprive one of the judgment of reason, as in the case of 
one who becomes demented through passion. Now he that is incontinent in 
anger retains more of the judgment of reason, than one who is incontinent 
in desire: since "anger listens to reason somewhat, but desire does not" 
as the Philosopher states (Ethic. vii, 6). Therefore the incontinent in 
anger is worse than the incontinent in desire.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the more dangerous a sin the more grievous it is. Now 
incontinence of anger would seem to be more dangerous, since it leads a 
man to a greater sin, namely murder, for this is a more grievous sin than 
adultery, to which incontinence of desire leads. Therefore incontinence 
of anger is graver than incontinence of desire.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 6) that "incontinence 
of anger is less disgraceful than incontinence of desire."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The sin of incontinence may be considered in two ways. 
First, on the part of the passion which occasions the downfall of reason. 
In this way incontinence of desire is worse than incontinence of anger, 
because the movement of desire is more inordinate than the movement of 
anger. There are four reasons for this, and the Philosopher indicates 
them, Ethic. vii, 6: First, because the movement of anger partakes 
somewhat of reason, since the angry man tends to avenge the injury done 
to him, and reason dictates this in a certain degree. Yet he does not 
tend thereto perfectly, because he does not intend the due mode of 
vengeance. on the other hand, the movement of desire is altogether in 
accord with sense and nowise in accord with reason. Secondly, because the 
movement of anger results more from the bodily temperament owing to the 
quickness of the movement of the bile which tends to anger. Hence one who 
by bodily temperament is disposed to anger is more readily angry than one 
who is disposed to concupiscence is liable to be concupiscent: wherefore 
also it happens more often that the children of those who are disposed to 
anger are themselves disposed to anger, than that the children of those 
who are disposed to concupiscence are also disposed to concupiscence. Now 
that which results from the natural disposition of the body is deemed 
more deserving of pardon. Thirdly, because anger seeks to work openly, 
whereas concupiscence is fain to disguise itself and creeps in by 
stealth. Fourthly, because he who is subject to concupiscence works  with 
pleasure, whereas the angry man works as though forced by a certain 
previous displeasure.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the sin of incontinence may be considered with regard to the 
evil into which one falls through forsaking reason; and thus incontinence 
of anger is, for the most part, more grievous, because it leads to things 
that are harmful to one's neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is more difficult to resist pleasure perseveringly than 
anger, because concupiscence is enduring. But for the moment it is more 
difficult to resist anger, on account of its impetuousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Concupiscence is stated to be without reason, not as though 
it destroyed altogether the judgment of reason, but because nowise does 
it follow the judgment of reason: and for this reason it is more 
disgraceful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[156] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers incontinence with regard to its 
result.<br>
