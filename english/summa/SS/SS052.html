</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the gift of counsel which corresponds to prudence. 
Under this head there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS052.html#SSQ52A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether counsel should be reckoned among the seven gifts of the Holy 
Ghost?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS052.html#SSQ52A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the gift of counsel corresponds to prudence?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS052.html#SSQ52A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the gift of counsel remains in heaven?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS052.html#SSQ52A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the fifth beatitude, "Blessed are the merciful," etc. 
corresponds to the gift of counsel?<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that counsel should not be reckoned among the gifts 
of the Holy Ghost. The gifts of the Holy Ghost are given as a help to the 
virtues, according to Gregory (Moral. ii, 49). Now  for the purpose of 
taking counsel, man is sufficiently perfected by the virtue of prudence, 
or even of {euboulia} (deliberating well), as is evident from what has 
been said (<A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2; <A Href="SS051.html#SSQ51OUTP1">Question [51]</a>, <A Href="SS051.html#SSQ51ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Therefore counsel should 
not be reckoned among the gifts of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the difference between the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost 
and the gratuitous graces seems to be that the latter are not given to 
all, but are divided among various people, whereas the gifts of the Holy 
Ghost are given to all who have the Holy Ghost. But counsel seems to be 
one of those things which are given by the Holy Ghost specially to 
certain persons, according to 1 Macc. 2:65: "Behold . . . your brother 
Simon is a man of counsel." Therefore counsel should be numbered among 
the gratuitous graces rather than among the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++8:14">Rm. 8:14</a>): "Whosoever are led by the 
Spirit of God, they are the sons of God." But counselling is not 
consistent with being led by another. Since then the gifts of the Holy 
Ghost are most befitting the children of God, who "have received the 
spirit of adoption of sons," it would seem that counsel should not be 
numbered among the gifts of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++11:2">Is. 11:2</a>): "(The Spirit of the Lord) 
shall rest upon him . . . the spirit of counsel, and of fortitude."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the gifts of the Holy 
Ghost are dispositions whereby the soul is rendered amenable to the 
motion of the Holy Ghost. Now God moves everything according to the mode 
of the thing moved: thus He moves the corporeal creature through time and 
place, and the spiritual creature through time, but not through place, as 
Augustine declares (Gen. ad lit. viii, 20,22). Again, it is proper to the 
rational creature to be moved through the research of reason to perform 
any particular action, and this research is called counsel. Hence the 
Holy Ghost is said to move the rational creature by way of counsel, 
wherefore counsel is reckoned among the gifts of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Prudence or {euboulia} (deliberating well), whether 
acquired or infused, directs man in the research of counsel according to 
principles that the reason can grasp; hence prudence or {euboulia} 
(deliberating well) makes man take good counsel either for himself or for 
another. Since, however, human reason is unable to grasp the singular and 
contingent things which may occur, the result is that "the thoughts of 
mortal men are fearful, and our counsels uncertain" (Wis. 9:14). Hence in 
the research of counsel, man requires to be directed by God who 
comprehends all things: and this is done through the gift of counsel, 
whereby man is directed as though counseled by God, just as, in human 
affairs, those who are unable to take counsel for themselves, seek 
counsel from those who are wiser.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That a man be of such good counsel as to counsel  others, 
may be due to a gratuitous grace; but that a man be counselled by God as 
to what he ought to do in matters necessary for salvation is common to 
all holy persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The children of God are moved by the Holy Ghost according 
to their mode, without prejudice to their free-will which is the "faculty 
of will and reason" [*Sent. iii, D, 24]. Accordingly the gift of counsel 
is befitting the children of God in so far as the reason is instructed by 
the Holy Ghost about what we have to do.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the gift of counsel corresponds to the virtue of prudence?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gift of counsel does not fittingly 
correspond to the virtue of prudence. For "the highest point of that 
which is underneath touches that which is above," as Dionysius observes 
(Div. Nom. vii), even as a man comes into contact with the angel in 
respect of his intellect. Now cardinal virtues are inferior to the gifts, 
as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Since, then, counsel is the first and 
lowest act of prudence, while command is its highest act, and judgment 
comes between, it seems that the gift corresponding to prudence is not 
counsel, but rather a gift of judgment or command.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one gift suffices to help one virtue, since the higher a 
thing is the more one it is, as proved in De Causis. Now prudence is 
helped by the gift of knowledge, which is not only speculative but also 
practical, as shown above (<A Href="SS009.html#SSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="SS009.html#SSQ9A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore the gift of counsel 
does not correspond to the virtue of prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it belongs properly to prudence to direct, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). But it belongs to the gift of counsel that man 
should be directed by God, as stated above (<A Href="SS052.html#SSQ52A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore the gift of 
counsel does not correspond to the virtue of prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The gift of counsel is about what has to be done for 
the sake of the end. Now prudence is about the same matter. Therefore 
they correspond to one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A lower principle of movement is helped chiefly, and is 
perfected through being moved by a higher principle of movement, as a 
body through being moved by a spirit. Now it is evident that the 
rectitude of human reason is compared to the Divine Reason, as a lower 
motive principle to a higher: for the Eternal Reason is the supreme rule 
of all human rectitude. Consequently prudence, which denotes rectitude of 
reason, is chiefly perfected and helped through being ruled and moved by 
the Holy Ghost, and this belongs to the gift of counsel, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS052.html#SSQ52A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore the gift of counsel corresponds to prudence, as helping 
and perfecting it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To judge and command belongs not to the thing moved, but to 
the mover. Wherefore, since in the gifts of the Holy  Ghost, the position 
of the human mind is of one moved rather than of a mover, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS052.html#SSQ52A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it follows that it would be unfitting to call 
the gift corresponding to prudence by the name of command or judgment 
rather than of counsel whereby it is possible to signify that the 
counselled mind is moved by another counselling it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The gift of knowledge does not directly correspond to 
prudence, since it deals with speculative matters: yet by a kind of 
extension it helps it. On the other hand the gift of counsel corresponds 
to prudence directly, because it is concerned about the same things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The mover that is moved, moves through being moved. Hence 
the human mind, from the very fact that it is directed by the Holy Ghost, 
is enabled to direct itself and others.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the gift of counsel remains in heaven?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the gift of counsel does not remain in heaven. 
For counsel is about what has to be done for the sake of an end. But in 
heaven nothing will have to be done for the sake of an end, since there 
man possesses the last end. Therefore the gift of counsel is not in 
heaven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, counsel implies doubt, for it is absurd to take counsel 
in matters that are evident, as the Philosopher observes (Ethic. iii, 3). 
Now all doubt will cease in heaven. Therefore there is no counsel in 
heaven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the saints in heaven are most conformed to God, 
according to 1 Jn. 3:2, "When He shall appear, we shall be like to Him." 
But counsel is not becoming to God, according to Rm. 11:34, "Who hath 
been His counsellor?" Therefore neither to the saints in heaven is the 
gift of counsel becoming.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xvii, 12): "When either the guilt 
or the righteousness of each nation is brought into the debate of the 
heavenly Court, the guardian of that nation is said to have won in the 
conflict, or not to have won."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS052.html#SSQ52A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the gifts of the 
Holy Ghost are connected with the motion of the rational creature by God. 
Now we must observe two points concerning the motion of the human mind by 
God. First, that the disposition of that which is moved, differs while it 
is being moved from its disposition when it is in the term of movement. 
Indeed if the mover is the principle of the movement alone, when the 
movement ceases, the action of the mover ceases as regards the thing 
moved, since it has already reached the term of movement, even as a 
house, after it is built, ceases being built by the builder. On the other 
hand, when the mover is cause not only of the movement, but also of the 
form to which the movement tends, then the action of the mover does  not 
cease even after the form has been attained: thus the sun lightens the 
air even after it is lightened. In this way, then, God causes in us 
virtue and knowledge, not only when we first acquire them, but also as 
long as we persevere in them: and it is thus that God causes in the 
blessed a knowledge of what is to be done, not as though they were 
ignorant, but by continuing that knowledge in them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless there are things which the blessed, whether angels or men, 
do not know: such things are not essential to blessedness, but concern 
the government of things according to Divine Providence. As regards 
these, we must make a further observation, namely, that God moves the 
mind of the blessed in one way, and the mind of the wayfarer, in another. 
For God moves the mind of the wayfarer in matters of action, by soothing 
the pre-existing anxiety of doubt; whereas there is simple nescience in 
the mind of the blessed as regards the things they do not know. From this 
nescience the angel's mind is cleansed, according to Dionysius (Coel. 
Hier. vii), nor does there precede in them any research of doubt, for 
they simply turn to God; and this is to take counsel of God, for as 
Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. v, 19) "the angels take counsel of God about 
things beneath them": wherefore the instruction which they receive from 
God in such matters is called "counsel."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly the gift of counsel is in the blessed, in so far as God 
preserves in them the knowledge that they have, and enlightens them in 
their nescience of what has to be done.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Even in the blessed there are acts directed to an end, or 
resulting, as it were, from their attainment of the end, such as the acts 
of praising God, or of helping on others to the end which they themselves 
have attained, for example the ministrations of the angels, and the 
prayers of the saints. In this respect the gift of counsel finds a place 
in them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Doubt belongs to counsel according to the present state of 
life, but not to that counsel which takes place in heaven. Even so 
neither have the theological virtues quite the same acts in heaven as on 
the way thither.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Counsel is in God, not as receiving but as giving it: and 
the saints in heaven are conformed to God, as receivers to the source 
whence they receive.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the fifth beatitude, which is that of mercy, corresponds to the gift of counsel?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fifth beatitude, which is that of mercy, 
does not correspond to the gift of counsel. For all the beatitudes are 
acts of virtue, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS069.html#FSQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS069.html#FSQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now we are directed by 
counsel in all acts of virtue. Therefore the fifth beatitude does not 
correspond more than any other to counsel. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, precepts are given about matters necessary for 
salvation, while counsel is given about matters which are not necessary 
for salvation. Now mercy is necessary for salvation, according to James 
2:13, "Judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy." On the 
other hand poverty is not necessary for salvation, but belongs to the 
life of perfection, according to Mt. 19:21. Therefore the beatitude of 
poverty corresponds to the gift of counsel, rather than to the beatitude 
of mercy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the fruits result from the beatitudes, for they denote a 
certain spiritual delight resulting from perfect acts of virtue. Now none 
of the fruits correspond to the gift of counsel, as appears from Gal. 
5:22, 23. Therefore neither does the beatitude of mercy correspond to the 
gift of counsel.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. iv): "Counsel is 
befitting the merciful, because the one remedy is to be delivered from 
evils so great, to pardon, and to give."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Counsel is properly about things useful for an end. Hence 
such things as are of most use for an end, should above all correspond to 
the gift of counsel. Now such is mercy, according to 1 Tim. 4:8, 
"Godliness [*'Pietas,' which our English word 'pity,' which is the same 
as mercy; see note on SS, Question [30], Article [1]] is profitable to all things." 
Therefore the beatitude of mercy specially corresponds to the gift of 
counsel, not as eliciting but as directing mercy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although counsel directs in all the acts of virtue, it does 
so in a special way in works of mercy, for the reason given above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Counsel considered as a gift of the Holy Ghost guides us in 
all matters that are directed to the end of eternal life whether they be 
necessary for salvation or not, and yet not every work of mercy is 
necessary for salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[52] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Fruit denotes something ultimate. Now the ultimate in 
practical matters consists not in knowledge but in an action which is the 
end. Hence nothing pertaining to practical knowledge is numbered among 
the fruits, but only such things as pertain to action, in which practical 
knowledge is the guide. Among these we find "goodness" and "benignity" 
which correspond to mercy.<br>
