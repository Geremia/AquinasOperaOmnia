  <h3 align="center">OF THE PRECEPTS OF CHARITY (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the Precepts of Charity, under which there are eight
    points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS044.html#SSQ44A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether precepts should be given
    about charity?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS044.html#SSQ44A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether there should be one or
    two?
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS044.html#SSQ44A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether two suffice?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS044.html#SSQ44A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is fittingly prescribed
    that we should love God, "with thy whole heart"?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS044.html#SSQ44A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether it is fittingly added:
    "With thy whole mind," etc.?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS044.html#SSQ44A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether it is possible to fulfil
    this precept in this life?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS044.html#SSQ44A7THEP1">(7)</a> Of the precept: "Thou shalt love
    thy neighbor as thyself";
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS044.html#SSQ44A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether the order of charity is
    included in the precept?

  <h3 align="left">Whether any precept should be given about charity?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no precept should be given
    about charity. For charity imposes the mode on all acts of virtue, since it
    is the form of the virtues as stated above (<a href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1"
      >Question [23]</a
    >, <a href="SS023.html#SSQ23A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>), while the precepts
    are about the virtues themselves. Now, according to the common saying, the
    mode is not included in the precept. Therefore no precepts should be given
    about charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, charity, which "is poured forth in our
    hearts by the Holy Ghost" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A5"
      >Rm. 5:5</a
    >), makes us free, since "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++3%3A17"
      >2 Cor. 3:17</a
    >). Now the obligation that arises from a precept is opposed to liberty,
    since it imposes a necessity. Therefore no precept should be given about
    charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity is the foremost among all the
    virtues, to which the precepts are directed, as shown above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS090.html#FSQ90A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS100.html#FSQ100OUTP1">Question [100]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS100.html#FSQ100A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>). If, therefore,
    any precepts were given about charity, they should have a place among the
    chief precepts which are those of the decalogue. But they have no place
    there. Therefore no precepts should be given about charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Whatever God requires of us is included in a
    precept. Now God requires that man should love Him, according to Dt. 10:12.
    Therefore it behooved precepts to be given about the love of charity, which
    is the love of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS016.html#SSQ16OUTP1"
      >Question [16]</a
    >, <a href="SS016.html#SSQ16A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS099.html#FSQ99OUTP1">Question [99]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS099.html#FSQ99A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), a precept implies
    the notion of something due. Hence a thing is a matter of precept, in so far
    as it is something due. Now a thing is due in two ways, for its own sake,
    and for the sake of something else. In every affair, it is the end that is
    due for its own sake, because it has the character of a good for its own
    sake: while that which is directed to the end is due for the sake of
    something else: thus for a physician, it is due for its own sake, that he
    should heal, while it is due for the sake of something else that he should
    give a medicine in order to heal. Now the end of the spiritual life is that
    man be united to God, and this union is effected by charity, while all
    things pertaining to the spiritual life are ordained to this union, as to
    their end. Hence the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++1%3A5"
      >1 Tim. 1:5</a
    >): "The end of the commandment is charity from a pure heart, and a good
    conscience, and an unfeigned faith." For all the virtues, about whose acts
    the precepts are given, are directed either to the freeing of the heart from
    the whirl of the passions---such are the virtues that regulate the
    passions---or at least to the possession of a good conscience---such are the
    virtues that regulate operations---or to the having of a right faith---such
    are those which pertain to the worship of God: and these three things are
    required of man that he may love God. For an impure heart is withdrawn from
    loving God, on account of the passion that inclines it to earthly things; an
    evil conscience gives man a horror for God's justice, through fear of His
    punishments; and an untrue faith draws man's affections to an untrue
    representation of God, and separates him from the truth of God. Now in every
    genus that which is for its own sake takes precedence of that which is for
    the sake of another, wherefore the greatest precept is that of charity, as
    stated in Mt. 22:39.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS100.html#FSQ100OUTP1">Question [100]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS100.html#FSQ100A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>) when we were
    treating of the commandments, the mode of love does not come under those
    precepts which are about the other acts of virtue: for instance, this
    precept, "Honor thy father and thy mother," does not prescribe that this
    should be done out of charity. The act of love does, however, fall under
    special precepts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The obligation of a precept is not
    opposed to liberty, except in one whose mind is averted from that which is
    prescribed, as may be seen in those who keep the precepts through fear
    alone. But the precept of love cannot be fulfilled save of one's own will,
    wherefore it is not opposed to charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All the precepts of the decalogue are
    directed to the love of God and of our neighbor: and therefore the precepts
    of charity had not to be enumerated among the precepts of the decalogue,
    since they are included in all of them.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether there should have been given two precepts of charity?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there should not have been
    given two precepts of charity. For the precepts of the Law are directed to
    virtue, as stated above (<a href="SS044.html#SSQ44A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>,
    Objection [3]). Now charity is one virtue, as shown above (<a
      href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/summa/SS/SS033.html#SSQ33OUTP1"
      >Question [33]</a
    >,
    <a
      href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/summa/SS/SS033.html#SSQ33A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >). Therefore only one precept of charity should have been given.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i,
    22,27), charity loves none but God in our neighbor. Now we are sufficiently
    directed to love God by the precept, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God."
    Therefore there was no need to add the precept about loving our neighbor.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, different sins are opposed to different
    precepts. But it is not a sin to put aside the love of our neighbor,
    provided we put not aside the love of God; indeed, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++15%3A26"
      >Lk. 15:26</a
    >): "If any man come to Me, and hate not his father, and mother... he cannot
    be My disciple." Therefore the precept of the love of God is not distinct
    from the precept of the love of our neighbor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++13%3A8"
      >Rm. 13:8</a
    >): "He that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the Law." But a law is not
    fulfilled unless all its precepts be observed. Therefore all the precepts
    are included in the love of our neighbor: and consequently the one precept
    of the love of our neighbor suffices. Therefore there should not be two
    precepts of charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++4%3A21"
      >1 Jn. 4:21</a
    >): "This commandment we have from God, that he who loveth God, love also
    his brother."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS091.html#FSQ91OUTP1">Question [91]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS091.html#FSQ91A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS094.html#FSQ94OUTP1">Question [94]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS094.html#FSQ94A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) when we were
    treating of the commandments, the precepts are to the Law what propositions
    are to speculative sciences, for in these latter, the conclusions are
    virtually contained in the first principles. Hence whoever knows the
    principles as to their entire virtual extent has no need to have the
    conclusions put separately before him. Since, however, some who know the
    principles are unable to consider all that is virtually contained therein,
    it is necessary, for their sake, that scientific conclusions should be
    traced to their principles. Now in practical matters wherein the precepts of
    the Law direct us, the end has the character of principle, as stated above
    (<a href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>,
    <a href="SS023.html#SSQ23A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>, ad 2;
    <a href="SS026.html#SSQ26OUTP1">Question [26]</a>,
    <a href="SS026.html#SSQ26A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1): and the love of
    God is the end to which the love of our neighbor is directed. Therefore it
    behooved us to receive precepts not only of the love of God but also of the
    love of our neighbor, on account of those who are less intelligent, who do
    not easily understand that one of these precepts is included in the
    other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although charity is one virtue, yet it
    has two acts, one of which is directed to the other as to its end. Now
    precepts are given about acts of virtue, and so there had to be several
    precepts of charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God is loved in our neighbor, as the end
    is loved in that which is directed to the end; and yet there was need for an
    explicit precept about both, for the reason given above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The means derive their goodness from
    their relation to the end, and accordingly aversion from the means derives
    its malice from the same source and from no other<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Love of our neighbor includes love of
    God, as the end is included in the means, and vice versa: and yet it
    behooved each precept to be given explicitly, for the reason given above.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether two precepts of charity suffice?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that two precepts of charity do not
    suffice. For precepts are given about acts of virtue. Now acts are
    distinguished by their objects. Since, then, man is bound to love four
    things out of charity, namely, God, himself, his neighbor and his own body,
    as shown above (<a href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>,
    <a href="SS025.html#SSQ25A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>;
    <a href="SS026.html#SSQ26OUTP1">Question [26]</a>), it seems that there
    ought to be four precepts of charity, so that two are not sufficient.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, love is not the only act of charity, but
    also joy, peace and beneficence. But precepts should be given about the acts
    of the virtues. Therefore two precepts of charity do not suffice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, virtue consists not only in doing good
    but also in avoiding evil. Now we are led by the positive precepts to do
    good, and by the negative precepts to avoid evil. Therefore there ought to
    have been not only positive, but also negative precepts about charity; and
    so two precepts of charity are not sufficient.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++22%3A40"
      >Mt. 22:40</a
    >): "On these two commandments dependeth the whole Law and the prophets."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Charity, as stated above (<a
      href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1"
      >Question [23]</a
    >, <a href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), is a kind of
    friendship. Now friendship is between one person and another, wherefore
    Gregory says (Hom. in Ev. xvii): "Charity is not possible between less than
    two": and it has been explained how one may love oneself out of charity (<a
      href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1"
      >Question [25]</a
    >, <a href="SS025.html#SSQ25A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now since good is the
    object of dilection and love, and since good is either an end or a means, it
    is fitting that there should be two precepts of charity, one whereby we are
    induced to love God as our end, and another whereby we are led to love our
    neighbor for God's sake, as for the sake of our end<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i,
    23), "though four things are to be loved out of charity, there was no need
    of a precept as regards the second and fourth," i.e. love of oneself and of
    one's own body. "For however much a man may stray from the truth, the love
    of himself and of his own body always remains in him." And yet the mode of
    this love had to be prescribed to man, namely, that he should love himself
    and his own body in an ordinate manner, and this is done by his loving God
    and his neighbor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS028.html#SSQ28OUTP1"
      >Question [28]</a
    >, <a href="SS028.html#SSQ28A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="SS029.html#SSQ29OUTP1">Question [29]</a>,
    <a href="SS029.html#SSQ29A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), the other acts of
    charity result from the act of love as effects from their cause. Hence the
    precepts of love virtually include the precepts about the other acts. And
    yet we find that, for the sake of the laggards, special precepts were given
    about each act---about joy (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Phil++4%3A4"
      >Phil. 4:4</a
    >): "Rejoice in the Lord always"---about peace (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++12%3A14"
      >Heb. 12:14</a
    >): "Follow peace with all men"---about beneficence (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal+++6%3A10"
      >Gal. 6:10</a
    >): "Whilst we have time, let us work good to all men"---and Holy Writ
    contains precepts about each of the parts of beneficence, as may be seen by
    anyone who considers the matter carefully.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To do good is more than to avoid evil,
    and therefore the positive precepts virtually include the negative precepts.
    Nevertheless we find explicit precepts against the vices contrary to
    charity: for, against hatred it is written (Lev. 12:17): "Thou shalt not
    hate thy brother in thy heart"; against sloth (Ecclus. 6:26): "Be not
    grieved with her bands"; against envy (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A26"
      >Gal. 5:26</a
    >): "Let us not be made desirous of vainglory, provoking one another,
    envying one another"; against discord (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++1%3A10"
      >1 Cor. 1:10</a
    >): "That you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among
    you"; and against scandal (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++14%3A13"
      >Rm. 14:13</a
    >): "That you put not a stumbling-block or a scandal in your brother's
    way."<br />

    Whether it is fittingly commanded that man should love God with his whole
    heart?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is unfittingly commanded
    that man should love God with his whole heart. For the mode of a virtuous
    act is not a matter of precept, as shown above (<a
      href="SS044.html#SSQ44A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 1; <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS100.html#FSQ100OUTP1">Question [100]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS100.html#FSQ100A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>). Now the words
    "with thy whole heart" signify the mode of the love of God. Therefore it is
    unfittingly commanded that man should love God with his whole heart.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "A thing is whole and perfect when it
    lacks nothing" (Phys. iii, 6). If therefore it is a matter of precept that
    God be loved with the whole heart, whoever does something not pertaining to
    the love of God, acts counter to the precept, and consequently sins
    mortally. Now a venial sin does not pertain to the love of God. Therefore a
    venial sin is a mortal sin, which is absurd.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to love God with one's whole heart
    belongs to perfection, since according to the Philosopher (Phys. iii, text.
    64), "to be whole is to be perfect." But that which belongs to perfection is
    not a matter of precept, but a matter of counsel. Therefore we ought not to
    be commanded to love God with our whole heart.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++6%3A5"
      >Dt. 6:5</a
    >): "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since precepts are given about acts of virtue,
    an act is a matter of precept according as it is an act of virtue. Now it is
    requisite for an act of virtue that not only should it fall on its own
    matter, but also that it should be endued with its due circumstances,
    whereby it is adapted to that matter. But God is to be loved as the last
    end, to which all things are to be referred. Therefore some kind of totality
    was to be indicated in connection with the precept of the love of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The commandment that prescribes an act
    of virtue does not prescribe the mode which that virtue derives from another
    and higher virtue, but it does prescribe the mode which belongs to its own
    proper virtue, and this mode is signified in the words "with thy whole
    heart."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To love God with one's whole heart has a
    twofold signification. First, actually, so that a man's whole heart be
    always actually directed to God: this is the perfection of heaven. Secondly,
    in the sense that a man's whole heart be habitually directed to God, so that
    it consent to nothing contrary to the love of God, and this is the
    perfection of the way. Venial sin is not contrary to this latter perfection,
    because it does not destroy the habit of charity, since it does not tend to
    a contrary object, but merely hinders the use of charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That perfection of charity to which the
    counsels are directed, is between the two perfections mentioned in the
    preceding reply: and it consists in man renouncing, as much as possible,
    temporal things, even such as are lawful, because they occupy the mind and
    hinder the actual movement of the heart towards God.<br />

    Whether to the words, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole
    heart," it was fitting to add "and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole
    strength"?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was unfitting to the words,
    "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with thy whole heart," to add, "and with
    thy whole soul, and with thy whole strength" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++6%3A5"
      >Dt. 6:5</a
    >). For heart does not mean here a part of the body, since to love God is
    not a bodily action: and therefore heart is to be taken here in a spiritual
    sense. Now the heart understood spiritually is either the soul itself or
    part of the soul. Therefore it is superfluous to mention both heart and
    soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man's strength whether spiritual or
    corporal depends on the heart. Therefore after the words, "Thou shalt love
    the Lord thy God with thy whole heart," it was unnecessary to add, "with all
    thy strength."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in Mt. 22:37 we read: "With all thy
    mind," which words do not occur here. Therefore it seems that this precept
    is unfittingly worded in Dt. 6.<br />
  </p>
  <p>On the contrary stands the authority of Scripture.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This precept is differently worded in various
    places: for, as we said in the first objection, in Dt. 6 three points are
    mentioned: "with thy whole heart," and "with thy whole soul," and "with thy
    whole strength." In Mt. 22 we find two of these mentioned, viz. "with thy
    whole heart" and "with thy whole soul," while "with thy whole strength" is
    omitted, but "with thy whole mind" is added. Yet in Mark 12 we find all
    four, viz. "with thy whole heart," and "with thy whole soul," and "with thy
    whole mind," and "with thy whole force" which is the same as "strength."
    Moreover, these four are indicated in Luke 10, where in place of "strength"
    or "force" we read "with all thy might." [*St. Thomas is explaining the
    Latin text which reads "ex tota fortitudine tua" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt+"
      >Dt.</a
    >), "ex tota virtue tua" (Mk.), and "ex omnibus tuis" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk+"
      >Lk.</a
    >), although the Greek in all three cases has {ex holes tes ischyos}, which
    the Douay renders "with thy whole strength."]<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly these four have to be explained, since the fact that one of them
    is omitted here or there is due to one implying another. We must therefore
    observe that love is an act of the will which is here denoted by the
    "heart," because just as the bodily heart is the principle of all the
    movements of the body, so too the will, especially as regards the intention
    of the last end which is the object of charity, is the principle of all the
    movements of the soul. Now there are three principles of action that are
    moved by the will, namely, the intellect which is signified by "the mind,"
    the lower appetitive power, signified by "the soul"; and the exterior
    executive power signified by "strength," "force" or "might." Accordingly we
    are commanded to direct our whole intention to God, and this is signified by
    the words "with thy whole heart"; to submit our intellect to God, and this
    is expressed in the words "with thy whole mind"; to regulate our appetite
    according to God, in the words "with thy whole soul"; and to obey God in our
    external actions, and this is to love God with our whole "strength," "force"
    or "might."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Chrysostom [*The quotation is from an anonymous author's unfinished work
    (Opus imperf. Hom. xlii, in Matth.) which is included in Chrysostom's
    works], on the other hand, takes "heart" and "soul" in the contrary sense;
    and Augustine (De Doctr. Christ. i, 22) refers "heart" to the thought,
    "soul" to the manner of life, and "mind" to the intellect. Again some
    explain "with thy whole heart" as denoting the intellect, "with thy whole
    soul" as signifying the will, "with thy mind" as pointing to the memory. And
    again, according to Gregory of Nyssa (De Hom. Opif. viii), "heart" signifies
    the vegetative soul, "soul" the sensitive, and "mind" the intellective soul,
    because our nourishment, sensation, and understanding ought all to be
    referred by us to God.<br />

    Whether it is possible in this life to fulfil this precept of the love of
    God?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in this life it is possible to
    fulfil this precept of the love of God. For according to Jerome [*Pelagius,
    Exposit. Cath. Fid.] "accursed is he who says that Cod has commanded
    anything impossible." But God gave this commandment, as is clear from Dt.
    6:5. Therefore it is possible to fulfil this precept in this life.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever does not fulfil a precept sins
    mortally, since according to Ambrose (De Parad. viii) sin is nothing else
    than "a transgression of the Divine Law, and disobedience of the heavenly
    commandments." If therefore this precept cannot be fulfilled by wayfarers,
    it follows that in this life no man can be without mortal sin, and this is
    against the saying of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++1%3A8"
      >1 Cor. 1:8</a
    >): "(Who also) will confirm you unto the end without crime," and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++3%3A10"
      >1 Tim. 3:10</a
    >): "Let them minister, having no crime."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, precepts are given in order to direct
    man in the way of salvation, according to Ps. 18:9: "The commandment of the
    Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes." Now it is useless to direct
    anyone to what is impossible. Therefore it is not impossible to fulfill this
    precept in this life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Perfect. Justit. viii):
    "In the fulness of heavenly charity this precept will be fulfilled: Thou
    shalt love the Lord thy God," etc. For as long as any carnal concupiscence
    remains, that can be restrained by continence, man cannot love God with all
    his heart.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A precept can be fulfilled in two ways;
    perfectly, and imperfectly. A precept is fulfilled perfectly, when the end
    intended by the author of the precept is reached; yet it is fulfilled,
    imperfectly however, when although the end intended by its author is not
    reached, nevertheless the order to that end is not departed from. Thus if
    the commander of an army order his soldiers to fight, his command will be
    perfectly obeyed by those who fight and conquer the foe, which is the
    commander's intention; yet it is fulfilled, albeit imperfectly, by those who
    fight without gaining the victory, provided they do nothing contrary to
    military discipline. Now God intends by this precept that man should be
    entirely united to Him, and this will be realized in heaven, when God will
    be "all in all," according to 1 Cor. 15:28. Hence this precept will be
    observed fully and perfectly in heaven; yet it is fulfilled, though
    imperfectly, on the way. Nevertheless on the way one man will fulfil it more
    perfectly than another, and so much the more, as he approaches by some kind
    of likeness to the perfection of heaven.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument proves that the precept
    can be fulfilled after a fashion on the way, but not perfectly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even as the soldier who fights
    legitimately without conquering is not blamed nor deserves to be punished
    for this, so too he that does not fulfil this precept on the way, but does
    nothing against the love of God, does not sin mortally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Perfect. Justit.
    viii), "why should not this perfection be prescribed to man, although no man
    attains it in this life? For one cannot run straight unless one knows
    whither to run. And how would one know this if no precept pointed it
    out."<br />

    Whether the precept of love of our neighbor is fittingly expressed?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the precept of the love of our
    neighbor is unfittingly expressed. For the love of charity extends to all
    men, even to our enemies, as may be seen in Mt. 5:44. But the word
    "neighbor" denotes a kind of "nighness" which does not seem to exist towards
    all men. Therefore it seems that this precept is unfittingly expressed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. ix,
    8) "the origin of our friendly relations with others lies in our relation to
    ourselves," whence it seems to follow that love of self is the origin of
    one's love for one's neighbor. Now the principle is greater than that which
    results from it. Therefore man ought not to love his neighbor as himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man loves himself, but not his neighbor,
    naturally. Therefore it is unfitting that he should be commanded to love his
    neighbor as himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++22%3A39"
      >Mt. 22:39</a
    >): "The second" commandment "is like to this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor
    as thyself."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This precept is fittingly expressed, for it
    indicates both the reason for loving and the mode of love. The reason for
    loving is indicated in the word "neighbor," because the reason why we ought
    to love others out of charity is because they are nigh to us, both as to the
    natural image of God, and as to the capacity for glory. Nor does it matter
    whether we say "neighbor," or "brother" according to 1 Jn. 4:21, or
    "friend," according to Lev. 19:18, because all these words express the same
    affinity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The mode of love is indicated in the words "as thyself." This does not mean
    that a man must love his neighbor equally as himself, but in like manner as
    himself, and this in three ways. First, as regards the end, namely, that he
    should love his neighbor for God's sake, even as he loves himself for God's
    sake, so that his love for his neighbor is a "holy" love. Secondly, as
    regards the rule of love, namely, that a man should not give way to his
    neighbor in evil, but only in good things, even as he ought to gratify his
    will in good things alone, so that his love for his neighbor may be a
    "righteous" love. Thirdly, as regards the reason for loving, namely, that a
    man should love his neighbor, not for his own profit, or pleasure, but in
    the sense of wishing his neighbor well, even as he wishes himself well, so
    that his love for his neighbor may be a "true" love: since when a man loves
    his neighbor for his own profit or pleasure, he does not love his neighbor
    truly, but loves himself.<br />

    Whether the order of charity is included in the precept?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the order of charity is not
    included in the precept. For whoever transgresses a precept does a wrong.
    But if man loves some one as much as he ought, and loves any other man more,
    he wrongs no man. Therefore he does not transgress the precept. Therefore
    the order of charity is not included in the precept.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is a matter of precept is
    sufficiently delivered to us in Holy Writ. Now the order of charity which
    was given above (<a href="SS026.html#SSQ26OUTP1">Question [26]</a>) is
    nowhere indicated in Holy Writ. Therefore it is not included in the
    precept.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, order implies some kind of distinction.
    But the love of our neighbor is prescribed without any distinction, in the
    words, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Therefore the order of
    charity is not included in the precept.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Whatever God works in us by His grace, He
    teaches us first of all by His Law, according to Jer. 31:33: "I will give My
    Law in their heart [*Vulg.: 'in their bowels, and I will write it in their
    heart']." Now God causes in us the order of charity, according to Cant 2:4:
    "He set in order charity in me." Therefore the order of charity comes under
    the precept of the Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS044.html#SSQ44A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >, ad 1), the mode which is essential to an act of virtue comes under the
    precept which prescribes that virtuous act. Now the order of charity is
    essential to the virtue, since it is based on the proportion of love to the
    thing beloved, as shown above (<a href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1"
      >Question [25]</a
    >, <a href="SS025.html#SSQ25A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>;
    <a href="SS026.html#SSQ26OUTP1">Question [26]</a>,
    <a href="SS026.html#SSQ26ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). It is therefore
    evident that the order of charity must come under the precept.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A man gratifies more the person he loves
    more, so that if he loved less one whom he ought to love more, he would wish
    to gratify more one whom he ought to gratify less, and so he would do an
    injustice to the one he ought to love more.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The order of those four things we have
    to love out of charity is expressed in Holy Writ. For when we are commanded
    to love God with our "whole heart," we are given to understand that we must
    love Him above all things. When we are commanded to love our neighbor "as
    ourselves," the love of self is set before love of our neighbor. In like
    manner where we are commanded (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++3%3A16"
      >1 Jn. 3:16</a
    >) "to lay down our souls," i.e. the life of our bodies, "for the brethren,"
    we are given to understand that a man ought to love his neighbor more than
    his own body; and again when we are commanded (<a
