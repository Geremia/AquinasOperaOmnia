</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that covetousness is not aa sin. For covetousness 
[avaritia] denotes a certain greed for gold [aeris aviditas*], because, 
to wit, it consists in a desire for money, under which all external goods 
may be comprised. [*The Latin for covetousness "avaritia" is derived from 
"aveo" to desire; but the Greek {philargyria} signifies literally "love 
of money": and it is to this that St. Thomas is alluding (cf. <A Href="SS118.html#SSQ118A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, Objection [2])]. Now it is not a sin to desire external goods: since man desires 
them naturally, both because they are naturally subject to man, and 
because by their means man's life is sustained (for which reason they are 
spoken of as his substance). Therefore covetousness is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every sin is against either God, or one's neighbor, or 
oneself, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But covetousness is not, 
properly speaking, a sin against God: since it is opposed neither to 
religion nor to the theological virtues, by which man is directed to God. 
Nor again is it a sin against oneself, for this pertains properly to 
gluttony and lust, of which the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++6:18">1 Cor. 6:18</a>): "He that 
committeth fornication sinneth against his own body." In like manner 
neither is it apparently a sin against one's neighbor, since a man harms 
no one by keeping what is his own. Therefore covetousness is not a sin. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things that occur naturally are not sins. Now 
covetousness comes naturally to old age and every kind of defect, 
according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 1). Therefore covetousness is 
not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++13:5">Heb. 13:5</a>): "Let your manners be without 
covetousness, contented with such things as you have."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In whatever things good consists in a due measure, evil 
must of necessity ensue through excess or deficiency of that measure. Now 
in all things that are for an end, the good consists in a certain 
measure: since whatever is directed to an end must needs be commensurate 
with the end, as, for instance, medicine is commensurate with health, as 
the Philosopher observes (Polit. i, 6). External goods come under the 
head of things useful for an end, as stated above (<A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117OUTP1">Question [117]</a>, <A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS002.html#FSQ2A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence it must needs be that man's good in their respect consists 
in a certain measure, in other words, that man seeks, according to a 
certain measure, to have external riches, in so far as they are necessary 
for him to live in keeping with his condition of life. Wherefore it will 
be a sin for him to exceed this measure, by wishing to acquire or keep 
them immoderately. This is what is meant by covetousness, which is 
defined as "immoderate love of possessing." It is therefore evident that 
covetousness is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is natural to man to desire external things as means to 
an end: wherefore this desire is devoid of sin, in so far as it is held 
in check by the rule taken from the nature of the end. But covetousness 
exceeds this rule, and therefore is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Covetousness may signify immoderation about external things 
in two ways. First, so as to regard immediately the acquisition and 
keeping of such things, when, to wit, a man acquires or keeps them more 
than is due. In this way it is a sin directly against one's neighbor, 
since one man cannot over-abound in external riches, without another man 
lacking them, for temporal goods cannot be possessed by many at the same 
time. Secondly, it may signify immoderation in the internal affection 
which a man has for riches when, for instance, a man loves them, desires 
them, or delights in them, immoderately. In this way by covetousness a 
man sins against himself, because it causes disorder in his affections, 
though not in his body as do the sins of the flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As a consequence, however, it is a sin against God, just as all mortal 
sins, inasmuch as man contemns things eternal for the sake of temporal 
things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Natural inclinations should be regulated according to 
reason, which is the governing power in human nature. Hence though old 
people seek more greedily the aid of external things, just as everyone 
that is in need seeks to have his need supplied, they are not excused 
from sin if they exceed this due measure of reason with regard to riches.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that covetousness is not a special sin. For Augustine 
says (De Lib. Arb. iii): "Covetousness, which in Greek is called 
{philargyria}, applies not only to silver or money, but also to anything 
that is desired immoderately." Now in every sin there is immoderate 
desire of something, because sin consists in turning away from the 
immutable good, and adhering to mutable goods, as state above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS071.html#FSQ71OUTP1">Question [71]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS071.html#FSQ71A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, Objection [3]). Therefore covetousness is a general sin.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Isidore (Etym. x), "the covetous [avarus] 
man" is so called because he is "greedy for brass [avidus aeris]," i.e. 
money: wherefore in Greek covetousness is called {philargyria}, i.e. 
"love of silver." Now silver, which stands for money, signifies all 
external goods the value of which can be measured by money, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117OUTP1">Question [117]</a>, <A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). Therefore covetousness is a desire for any 
external thing: and consequently seems to be a general sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a gloss on Rm. 7:7, "For I had not known concupiscence," 
says: "The law is good, since by forbidding concupiscence, it forbids all 
evil." Now the law seems to forbid especially the concupiscence of 
covetousness: hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++20:17">Ex. 20:17</a>): "Thou shalt not covet thy 
neighbor's goods." Therefore the concupiscence of covetousness is all 
evil, and so covetousness is a general sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Covetousness is numbered together with other special 
sins (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++1:29">Rm. 1:29</a>), where it is written: "Being filled with all iniquity, 
malice, fornication, covetousness" [Douay: 'avarice'], etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sins take their species from their objects, as stated 
above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now the object of a sin is the good towards 
which an inordinate appetite tends. Hence where there is a special aspect 
of good inordinately desired, there is a special kind of sin. Now the 
useful good differs in aspect from the delightful good. And riches, as 
such, come under the head of useful good, since they are desired under 
the aspect of being useful to man. Consequently covetousness is a special 
sin, forasmuch as it is an immoderate love of having possessions, which 
are comprised under the name of money, whence covetousness [avaritia] is 
denominated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since, however, the verb "to have," which seems to have been originally 
employed in connection with possessions whereof we are absolute masters, 
is applied to many other things (thus a man is said to have health, a 
wife, clothes, and so forth, as stated in De Praedicamentis), 
consequently the term "covetousness" has been amplified to denote all 
immoderate desire for having anything whatever. Thus Gregory says in a 
homily (xvi in Ev.) that "covetousness is a desire not only for money, 
but also for knowledge and high places, when prominence is immoderately 
sought  after." In this way covetousness is not a special sin: and in 
this sense Augustine speaks of covetousness in the passage quoted in the 
First Objection. Wherefore this suffices for the Reply to the First 
Objection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All those external things that are subject to the uses of 
human life are comprised under the term "money," inasmuch as they have 
the aspect of useful good. But there are certain external goods that can 
be obtained by money, such as pleasures, honors, and so forth, which are 
desirable under another aspect. Wherefore the desire for such things is 
not properly called covetousness, in so far as it is a special vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This gloss speaks of the inordinate concupiscence for 
anything whatever. For it is easy to understand that if it is forbidden 
to covet another's possessions it is also forbidden to covet those things 
that can be obtained by means of those possessions.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether covetousness is opposed to liberality?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that covetousness is not opposed to liberality. For 
Chrysostom, commenting on Mt. 5:6, "Blessed are they that hunger and 
thirst after justice," says, (Hom. xv in Matth.) that there are two kinds 
of justice, one general, and the other special, to which covetousness is 
opposed: and the Philosopher says the same (Ethic. v, 2). Therefore 
covetousness is not opposed to liberality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sin of covetousness consists in a man's exceeding 
the measure in the things he possesses. But this measure is appointed by 
justice. Therefore covetousness is directly opposed to justice and not to 
liberality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, liberality is a virtue that observes the mean between 
two contrary vices, as the Philosopher states (Ethic. i, 7; iv, 1). But 
covetousness has no contrary and opposite sin, according to the 
Philosopher (Ethic. v, 1,2). Therefore covetousness is not opposed to 
liberality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eccles++5:9">Eccles. 5:9</a>): "A covetous man shall not 
be satisfied with money, and he that loveth riches shall have no fruits 
from them." Now not to be satisfied with money and to love it 
inordinately are opposed to liberality, which observes the mean in the 
desire of riches. Therefore covetousness is opposed to liberality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Covetousness denotes immoderation with regard to riches 
in two ways. First, immediately in respect of the acquisition and keeping 
of riches. In this way a man obtains money beyond his due, by stealing or 
retaining another's property. This is opposed to justice, and in this 
sense covetousness is mentioned (Ezech. 22:27): "Her princes in the midst 
of her are like wolves  ravening the prey to shed blood . . . and to run 
after gains through covetousness." Secondly, it denotes immoderation in 
the interior affections for riches; for instance, when a man loves or 
desires riches too much, or takes too much pleasure in them, even if he 
be unwilling to steal. In this way covetousness is opposed to liberality, 
which moderates these affections, as stated above (<A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117OUTP1">Question [117]</a>, <A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3, <A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117A2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 3, <A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117A2A3A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). In this sense covetousness is spoken of (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Cor++9:5">2 Cor. 9:5</a>): 
"That they would . . . prepare this blessing before promised, to be 
ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness," where a gloss observes: 
"Lest they should regret what they had given, and give but little."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Chrysostom and the Philosopher are speaking of covetousness 
in the first sense: covetousness in the second sense is called 
illiberality [*{aneleutheria}] by the Philosopher.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It belongs properly to justice to appoint the measure in 
the acquisition and keeping of riches from the point of view of legal 
due, so that a man should neither take nor retain another's property. But 
liberality appoints the measure of reason, principally in the interior 
affections, and consequently in the exterior taking and keeping of money, 
and in the spending of the same, in so far as these proceed from the 
interior affection, looking at the matter from the point of view not of 
the legal but of the moral debt, which latter depends on the rule of 
reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Covetousness as opposed to justice has no opposite vice: 
since it consists in having more than one ought according to justice, the 
contrary of which is to have less than one ought, and this is not a sin 
but a punishment. But covetousness as opposed to liberality has the vice 
of prodigality opposed to it.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether covetousness is always a mortal sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that covetousness is always a mortal sin. For no one is 
worthy of death save for a mortal sin. But men are worthy of death on 
account of covetousness. For the Apostle after saying (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++1:29">Rm. 1:29</a>): "Being 
filled with all iniquity . . . fornication, covetousness [Douay: 
'avarice']," etc. adds (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++1:32">Rm. 1:32</a>): "They who do such things are worthy of 
death." Therefore covetousness is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the least degree of covetousness is to hold to one's own 
inordinately. But this seemingly is a mortal sin: for Basil says (Serm. 
super. Luc. xii, 18): "It is the hungry man's bread that thou keepest 
back, the naked man's cloak that thou hoardest, the needy man's money 
that thou possessest, hence thou despoilest as many as thou mightest 
succor."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is a mortal sin to do an injustice to another, since it is 
contrary to the love of our neighbor. Much more therefore is all 
covetousness a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one is struck with spiritual blindness save through a 
mortal sin, for this deprives a man of the light of grace. But, according 
to Chrysostom [*Hom. xv in the Opus Imperfectum, falsely ascribed to St. 
Chrysostom], "Lust for money brings darkness on the soul." Therefore 
covetousness, which is lust for money, is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on 1 Cor. 3:12, "If any man build upon this 
foundation," says (cf. St. Augustine, De Fide et Oper. xvi) that "he 
builds wood, hay, stubble, who thinks in the things of the world, how he 
may please the world," which pertains to the sin of covetousness. Now he 
that builds wood, hay, stubble, sins not mortally but venially, for it is 
said of him that "he shall be saved, yet so as by fire." Therefore 
covetousness is some times a venial sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS118.html#SSQ118A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) covetousness is twofold. In one 
way it is opposed to justice, and thus it is a mortal sin in respect of 
its genus. For in this sense covetousness consists in the unjust taking 
or retaining of another's property, and this belongs to theft or robbery, 
which are mortal sins, as stated above (<A Href="SS066.html#SSQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="SS066.html#SSQ66ATHEP1">Articles [6]</a>,8). Yet venial sin 
may occur in this kind of covetousness by reason of imperfection of the 
act, as stated above (<A Href="SS066.html#SSQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="SS066.html#SSQ66A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 3), when we were treating of theft.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In another way covetousness may be take as opposed to liberality: in 
which sense it denotes inordinate love of riches. Accordingly if the love 
of riches becomes so great as to be preferred to charity, in such wise 
that a man, through love of riches, fear not to act counter to the love 
of God and his neighbor, covetousness will then be a mortal sin. If, on 
the other hand, the inordinate nature of his love stops short of this, so 
that although he love riches too much, yet he does not prefer the love of 
them to the love of God, and is unwilling for the sake of riches to do 
anything in opposition to God or his neighbor, then covetousness is a 
venial sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Covetousness is numbered together with mortal sins, by 
reason of the aspect under which it is a mortal sin.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Lust for riches, properly speaking, brings darkness on the 
soul, when it puts out the light of charity, by preferring the love of 
riches to the love of God.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether covetousness is the greatest of sins?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that covetousness is the greatest of sins. For it is 
written (Ecclus. 10:9): "Nothing is more wicked than a covetous man," and 
the text continues: "There is not a more wicked  thing than to love 
money: for such a one setteth even his own soul to sale." Tully also says 
(De Offic. i, under the heading, 'True magnanimity is based chiefly on 
two things'): "Nothing is so narrow or little minded as to love money." 
But this pertains to covetousness. Therefore covetousness is the most 
grievous of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the more a sin is opposed to charity, the more grievous 
it is. Now covetousness is most opposed to charity: for Augustine says 
(<A Href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [83]</a>, qu. 36) that "greed is the bane of charity." Therefore 
covetousness is the greatest of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the gravity of a sin is indicated by its being 
incurable: wherefore the sin against the Holy Ghost is said to be most 
grievous, because it is irremissible. But covetousness is an incurable 
sin: hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "old age and 
helplessness of any kind make men illiberal." Therefore covetousness is 
the most grievous of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[5] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eph++5:5">Eph. 5:5</a>) that covetousness is "a 
serving of idols." Now idolatry is reckoned among the most grievous sins. 
Therefore covetousness is also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Adultery is a more grievous sin than theft, according 
to Prov. 6:30. But theft pertains to covetousness. Therefore covetousness 
is not the most grievous of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Every sin, from the very fact that it is an evil, 
consists in the corruption or privation of some good: while, in so far as 
it is voluntary, it consists in the desire of some good. Consequently the 
order of sins may be considered in two ways. First, on the part of the 
good that is despised or corrupted by sin, and then the greater the good 
the graver the sin. From this point of view a sin that is against God is 
most grievous; after this comes a sin that is committed against a man's 
person, and after this comes a sin against external things, which are 
deputed to man's use, and this seems to belong to covetousness. Secondly, 
the degrees of sin may be considered on the part of the good to which the 
human appetite is inordinately subjected; and then the lesser the good, 
the more deformed is the sin: for it is more shameful to be subject to a 
lower than to a higher good. Now the good of external things is the 
lowest of human goods: since it is less than the good of the body, and 
this is less than the good of the soul, which is less than the Divine 
good. From this point of view the sin of covetousness, whereby the human 
appetite is subjected even to external things, has in a way a greater 
deformity. Since, however, corruption or privation of good is the formal 
element in sin, while conversion to a mutable good is the material 
element, the gravity of the sin is to be judged from the point of view of 
the good corrupted, rather than from that of the good to which the 
appetite is subjected. Hence we must assert that covetousness is not 
simply the most grievous of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These authorities speak of covetousness on the part of the 
good to which the appetite is subjected. Hence (Ecclus.  10:10) it is 
given as a reason that the covetous man "setteth his own soul to sale"; 
because, to wit, he exposes his soul---that is, his life---to danger for 
the sake of money. Hence the text continues: "Because while he liveth he 
hath cast away"---that is, despised---"his bowels," in order to make 
money. Tully also adds that it is the mark of a "narrow mind," namely, 
that one be willing to be subject to money.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine is taking greed generally, in reference to any 
temporal good, not in its special acceptation for covetousness: because 
greed for any temporal good is the bane of charity, inasmuch as a man 
turns away from the Divine good through cleaving to a temporal good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sin against the Holy Ghost is incurable in one way, 
covetousness in another. For the sin against the Holy Ghost is incurable 
by reason of contempt: for instance, because a man contemns God's mercy, 
or His justice, or some one of those things whereby man's sins are 
healed: wherefore incurability of this kind points to the greater gravity 
of the sin. on the other hand, covetousness is incurable on the part of a 
human defect; a thing which human nature ever seeks to remedy, since the 
more deficient one is the more one seeks relief from external things, and 
consequently the more one gives way to covetousness. Hence incurability 
of this kind is an indication not of the sin being more grievous, but of 
its being somewhat more dangerous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Covetousness is compared to idolatry on account of a 
certain likeness that it bears to it: because the covetous man, like the 
idolater, subjects himself to an external creature, though not in the 
same way. For the idolater subjects himself to an external creature by 
paying it Divine honor, whereas the covetous man subjects himself to an 
external creature by desiring it immoderately for use, not for worship. 
Hence it does not follow that covetousness is as grievous a sin as 
idolatry.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that covetousness is not a spiritual sin. For spiritual 
sins seem to regard spiritual goods. But the matter of covetousness is 
bodily goods, namely, external riches. Therefore covetousness is not a 
spiritual sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, spiritual sin is condivided with sin of the flesh. Now 
covetousness is seemingly a sin of the flesh, for it results from the 
corruption of the flesh, as instanced in old people who, through 
corruption of carnal nature, fall into covetousness. Therefore 
covetousness is not a spiritual sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a sin of the flesh is one by which man's body is 
disordered, according to the saying of the Apostle (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++6:18">1 Cor. 6:18</a>), "He 
that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body." Now 
covetousness disturbs man even in his body; wherefore  Chrysostom (Hom. 
xxix in Matth.) compares the covetous man to the man who was possessed by 
the devil (Mk. 5) and was troubled in body. Therefore covetousness seems 
not to be a spiritual sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi) numbers covetousness among 
spiritual vices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sins are seated chiefly in the affections: and all the 
affections or passions of the soul have their term in pleasure and 
sorrow, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 5). Now some pleasures 
are carnal and some spiritual. Carnal pleasures are those which are 
consummated in the carnal senses---for instance, the pleasures of the 
table and sexual pleasures: while spiritual pleasures are those which are 
consummated in the mere apprehension of the soul. Accordingly, sins of 
the flesh are those which are consummated in carnal pleasures, while 
spiritual sins are consummated in pleasures of the spirit without 
pleasure of the flesh. Such is covetousness: for the covetous man takes 
pleasure in the consideration of himself as a possessor of riches. 
Therefore covetousness is a spiritual sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Covetousness with regard to a bodily object seeks the 
pleasure, not of the body but only of the soul, forasmuch as a man takes 
pleasure in the fact that he possesses riches: wherefore it is not a sin 
of the flesh. Nevertheless by reason of its object it is a mean between 
purely spiritual sins, which seek spiritual pleasure in respect of 
spiritual objects (thus pride is about excellence), and purely carnal 
sins, which seek a purely bodily pleasure in respect of a bodily object.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Movement takes its species from the term "whereto" and not 
from the term "wherefrom." Hence a vice of the flesh is so called from 
its tending to a pleasure of the flesh, and not from its originating in 
some defect of the flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Chrysostom compares a covetous man to the man who was 
possessed by the devil, not that the former is troubled in the flesh in 
the same way as the latter, but by way of contrast, since while the 
possessed man, of whom we read in Mk. 5, stripped himself, the covetous 
man loads himself with an excess of riches.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether covetousness is a capital vice?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that covetousness is not a capital vice. For 
covetousness is opposed to liberality as the mean, and to prodigality as 
extreme. But neither is liberality a principal virtue, nor prodigality a 
capital vice. Therefore covetousness also should not be reckoned a 
capital vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), those vices are 
called capital which have principal ends, to which the ends of other 
vices are directed. But this does not apply to covetousness: since riches 
have the aspect, not of an end, but rather of  something directed to an 
end, as stated in Ethic. i, 5. Therefore covetousness is not a capital 
vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. xv), that "covetousness arises 
sometimes from pride, sometimes from fear. For there are those who, when 
they think that they lack the needful for their expenses, allow the mind 
to give way to covetousness. And there are others who, wishing to be 
thought more of, are incited to greed for other people's property." 
Therefore covetousness arises from other vices instead of being a capital 
vice in respect of other vices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi) reckons covetousness among the 
capital vices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated in the Second Objection, a capital vice is one 
which under the aspect of end gives rise to other vices: because when an 
end is very desirable, the result is that through desire thereof man sets 
about doing many things either good or evil. Now the most desirable end 
is happiness or felicity, which is the last end of human life, as stated 
above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,7,8): wherefore the more a thing is furnished with 
the conditions of happiness, the more desirable it is. Also one of the 
conditions of happiness is that it be self-sufficing, else it would not 
set man's appetite at rest, as the last end does. Now riches give great 
promise of self-sufficiency, as Boethius says (De Consol. iii): the 
reason of which, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 5), is that we 
"use money in token of taking possession of something," and again it is 
written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eccles++10:19">Eccles. 10:19</a>): "All things obey money." Therefore covetousness, 
which is desire for money, is a capital vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Virtue is perfected in accordance with reason, but vice is 
perfected in accordance with the inclination of the sensitive appetite. 
Now reason and sensitive appetite do not belong chiefly to the same 
genus, and consequently it does not follow that principal vice is opposed 
to principal virtue. Wherefore, although liberality is not a principal 
virtue, since it does not regard the principal good of the reason, yet 
covetousness is a principal vice, because it regards money, which 
occupies a principal place among sensible goods, for the reason given in 
the Article.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, prodigality is not directed to an end that is 
desirable principally, indeed it seems rather to result from a lack of 
reason. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "a prodigal man is 
a fool rather than a knave."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is true that money is directed to something else as its 
end: yet in so far as it is useful for obtaining all sensible things, it 
contains, in a way, all things virtually. Hence it has a certain likeness 
to happiness, as stated in the Article.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Nothing prevents a capital vice from arising sometimes out 
of other vices, as stated above (<A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS036.html#SSQ36OUTP1">Question [36]</a>, <A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS036.html#SSQ36A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>),

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the daughters of covetousness are not as commonly 
stated, namely, "treachery, fraud, falsehood, perjury, restlessness, 
violence, and insensibility to mercy." For covetousness is opposed to 
liberality, as stated above (<A Href="SS118.html#SSQ118A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Now treachery, fraud, and falsehood 
are opposed to prudence, perjury to religion, restlessness to hope, or to 
charity which rests in the beloved object, violence to justice, 
insensibility to mercy. Therefore these vices have no connection with 
covetousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, treachery, fraud and falsehood seem to pertain to the 
same thing, namely, the deceiving of one's neighbor. Therefore they 
should not be reckoned as different daughters of covetousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Isidore (Comment. in Deut.) enumerates nine daughters of 
covetousness; which are "lying, fraud, theft, perjury, greed of filthy 
lucre, false witnessing, violence, inhumanity, rapacity." Therefore the 
former reckoning of daughters is insufficient.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[8] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 1) mentions many kinds of 
vices as belonging to covetousness which he calls illiberality, for he 
speaks of those who are "sparing, tight-fisted, skinflints 
[*{kyminopristes}], misers [*{kimbikes}], who do illiberal deeds," and of 
those who "batten on whoredom, usurers, gamblers, despoilers of the dead, 
and robbers." Therefore it seems that the aforesaid enumeration is 
insufficient.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[8] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, tyrants use much violence against their subjects. But 
the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "tyrants who destroy cities and 
despoil sacred places are not to be called illiberal," i.e. covetous. 
Therefore violence should not be reckoned a daughter of covetousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi) assigns to covetousness the 
daughters mentioned above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The daughters of covetousness are the vices which arise 
therefrom, especially in respect of the desire of an end. Now since 
covetousness is excessive love of possessing riches, it exceeds in two 
things. For in the first place it exceeds in retaining, and in this 
respect covetousness gives rise to "insensibility to mercy," because, to 
wit, a man's heart is not softened by mercy to assist the needy with his 
riches [*See Question [30], Article [1]]. In the second place it belongs to covetousness 
to exceed in receiving, and in this respect covetousness may be 
considered in two ways. First as in the thought [affectu]. In this way it 
gives rise to "restlessness," by hindering man with excessive anxiety and 
care, for "a covetous man shall not be satisfied with money" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eccles++5:9">Eccles. 5:9</a>). Secondly, it may be considered in the execution  [effectu]. In this 
way the covetous man, in acquiring other people's goods, sometimes 
employs force, which pertains to "violence," sometimes deceit, and then 
if he has recourse to words, it is "falsehood," if it be mere words, 
"perjury" if he confirm his statement by oath; if he has recourse to 
deeds, and the deceit affects things, we have "fraud"; if persons, then 
we have "treachery," as in the case of Judas, who betrayed Christ through 
covetousness.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There is no need for the daughters of a capital sin to 
belong to that same kind of vice: because a sin of one kind allows of 
sins even of a different kind being directed to its end; seeing that it 
is one thing for a sin to have daughters, and another for it to have 
species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> These three are distinguished as stated in the Article.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> These nine are reducible to the seven aforesaid. For lying 
and false witnessing are comprised under falsehood, since false 
witnessing is a special kind of lie, just as theft is a special kind of 
fraud, wherefore it is comprised under fraud; and greed of filthy lucre 
belongs to restlessness; rapacity is comprised under violence, since it 
is a species thereof; and inhumanity is the same as insensibility to 
mercy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[8] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The vices mentioned by Aristotle are species rather than 
daughters of illiberality or covetousness. For a man may be said to be 
illiberal or covetous through a defect in giving. If he gives but little 
he is said to be "sparing"; if nothing, he is "tightfisted": if he gives 
with great reluctance, he is said to be {kyminopristes} [skinflint], a 
cumin-seller, as it were, because he makes a great fuss about things of 
little value. Sometimes a man is said to be illiberal or covetous, 
through an excess in receiving, and this in two ways. In one way, through 
making money by disgraceful means, whether in performing shameful and 
servile works by means of illiberal practices, or by acquiring more 
through sinful deeds, such as whoredom or the like, or by making a profit 
where one ought to have given gratis, as in the case of usury, or by 
laboring much to make little profit. In another way, in making money by 
unjust means, whether by using violence on the living, as robbers do, or 
by despoiling the dead, or by preying on one's friends, as gamblers do.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[118] A[8] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Just as liberality is about moderate sums of money, so is 
illiberality. Wherefore tyrants who take great things by violence, are 
said to be, not illiberal, but unjust.<br>
