<H3 Align="Center">OF THE SIN OF BLASPHEMY, IN GENERAL (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the sin of blasphemy, which is opposed to the 
confession of faith; and (1) blasphemy in general, (2) that blasphemy 
which is called the sin against the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS013.html#SSQ13A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether blasphemy is opposed to the confession of faith?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS013.html#SSQ13A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether blasphemy is always a mortal sin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS013.html#SSQ13A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether blasphemy is the most grievous sin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS013.html#SSQ13A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether blasphemy is in the damned?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that blasphemy is not opposed to the confession of 
faith. Because to blaspheme is to utter an affront or insult against the 
Creator. Now this pertains to ill-will against God rather than to 
unbelief. Therefore blasphemy is not opposed to the confession of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, on Eph. 4:31, "Let blasphemy . . . be put away from 
you," a gloss says, "that which is committed against God or  the saints." 
But confession of faith, seemingly, is not about other things than those 
pertaining to God, Who is the object of faith. Therefore blasphemy is not 
always opposed to the confession of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to some, there are three kinds of blasphemy. 
The first of these is when something unfitting is affirmed of God; the 
second is when something fitting is denied of Him; and the third, when 
something proper to God is ascribed to a creature, so that, seemingly, 
blasphemy is not only about God, but also about His creatures. Now the 
object of faith is God. Therefore blasphemy is not opposed to confession 
of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++1:12,13">1 Tim. 1:12,13</a>): "I . . . before was 
a blasphemer and a persecutor," and afterwards, "I did it ignorantly in" 
my "unbelief." Hence it seems that blasphemy pertains to unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The word blasphemy seems to denote the disparagement of 
some surpassing goodness, especially that of God. Now God, as Dionysius 
says (Div. Nom. i), is the very essence of true goodness. Hence whatever 
befits God, pertains to His goodness, and whatever does not befit Him, is 
far removed from the perfection of goodness which is His Essence. 
Consequently whoever either denies anything befitting God, or affirms 
anything unbefitting Him, disparages the Divine goodness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this may happen in two ways. In the first way it may happen merely 
in respect of the opinion in the intellect; in the second way this 
opinion is united to a certain detestation in the affections, even as, on 
the other hand, faith in God is perfected by love of Him. Accordingly 
this disparagement of the Divine goodness is either in the intellect 
alone, or in the affections also. If it is in thought only, it is 
blasphemy of the heart, whereas if it betrays itself outwardly in speech 
it is blasphemy is opposed to confession of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> He that speaks against God, with the intention of reviling 
Him, disparages the Divine goodness, not only in respect of the falsehood 
in his intellect, but also by reason of the wickedness of his will, 
whereby he detests and strives to hinder the honor due to God, and this 
is perfect blasphemy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even as God is praised in His saints, in so far as praise 
is given to the works which God does in His saints, so does blasphemy 
against the saints, redound, as a consequence, against God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Properly speaking, the sin of blasphemy is not in this way 
divided into three species: since to affirm unfitting things, or to deny 
fitting things of God, differ merely as affirmation and negation. For 
this diversity does not cause distinct species of habits, since the 
falsehood of affirmations and negations is made known by the same 
knowledge, and it is the same  ignorance which errs in either way, since 
negatives are proved by affirmatives, according to Poster. i, 25. Again 
to ascribe to creatures things that are proper to God, seems to amount to 
the same as affirming something unfitting of Him, since whatever is 
proper to God is God Himself: and to ascribe to a creature, that which is 
proper to God, is to assert that God is the same as a creature.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether blasphemy is always a mortal sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that blasphemy is not always a mortal sin. Because 
a gloss on the words, "Now lay you also all away," etc. (Col. 3:8) says: 
"After prohibiting greater crimes he forbids lesser sins": and yet among 
the latter he includes blasphemy. Therefore blasphemy is comprised among 
the lesser, i.e. venial, sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every mortal sin is opposed to one of the precepts of 
the decalogue. But, seemingly, blasphemy is not contrary to any of them. 
Therefore blasphemy is not a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sins committed without deliberation, are not mortal: 
hence first movements are not mortal sins, because they precede the 
deliberation of the reason, as was shown above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS074.html#FSQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS074.html#FSQ74ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,10). Now 
blasphemy sometimes occurs without deliberation of the reason. Therefore 
it is not always a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Lev. 24:16): "He that blasphemeth the 
name of the Lord, dying let him die." Now the death punishment is not 
inflicted except for a mortal sin. Therefore blasphemy is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), a mortal sin is one 
whereby a man is severed from the first principle of spiritual life, 
which principle is the charity of God. Therefore whatever things are 
contrary to charity, are mortal sins in respect of their genus. Now 
blasphemy, as to its genus, is opposed to Divine charity, because, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS013.html#SSQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it disparages the Divine goodness, which is the 
object of charity. Consequently blasphemy is a mortal sin, by reason of 
its genus.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This gloss is not to be understood as meaning that all the 
sins which follow, are mortal, but that whereas all those mentioned 
previously are more grievous sins, some of those mentioned afterwards are 
less grievous; and yet among the latter some more grievous sins are 
included.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since, as stated above (<A Href="SS013.html#SSQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), blasphemy is contrary to the 
confession of faith, its prohibition is comprised under the prohibition 
of unbelief, expressed by the words: "I am the Lord thy God," etc. (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++20:1">Ex. 20:1</a>). Or else, it is forbidden by the words: "Thou shalt not take the 
name of . . . God in vain" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++20:7">Ex. 20:7</a>). Because he who asserts something 
false about God, takes His  name in vain even more than he who uses the 
name of God in confirmation of a falsehood.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There are two ways in which blasphemy may occur unawares 
and without deliberation. In the first way, by a man failing to advert to 
the blasphemous nature of his words, and this may happen through his 
being moved suddenly by passion so as to break out into words suggested 
by his imagination, without heeding to the meaning of those words: this 
is a venial sin, and is not a blasphemy properly so called. In the second 
way, by adverting to the meaning of his words, and to their blasphemous 
nature: in which case he is not excused from mortal sin, even as neither 
is he who, in a sudden movement of anger, kills one who is sitting beside 
him.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the sin of blasphemy is the greatest sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the sin of blasphemy is not the greatest sin. 
For, according to Augustine (Enchiridion xii), a thing is said to be evil 
because it does harm. Now the sin of murder, since it destroys a man's 
life, does more harm than the sin of blasphemy, which can do no harm to 
God. Therefore the sin of murder is more grievous than that of blasphemy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a perjurer calls upon God to witness to a falsehood, and 
thus seems to assert that God is false. But not every blasphemer goes so 
far as to say that God is false. Therefore perjury is a more grievous sin 
than blasphemy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, on Ps. 74:6, "Lift not up your horn on high," a gloss 
says: "To excuse oneself for sin is the greatest sin of all." Therefore 
blasphemy is not the greatest sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> On Is. 18:2, "To a terrible people," etc. a gloss says: 
"In comparison with blasphemy, every sin is slight."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS013.html#SSQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), blasphemy is opposed to the 
confession of faith, so that it contains the gravity of unbelief: while 
the sin is aggravated if the will's detestation is added thereto, and yet 
more, if it breaks out into words, even as love and confession add to the 
praise of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, since, as stated above (<A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a>, <A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), unbelief is the 
greatest of sins in respect of its genus, it follows that blasphemy also 
is a very great sin, through belonging to the same genus as unbelief and 
being an aggravated form of that sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> If we compare murder and blasphemy as regards the objects 
of those sins, it is clear that blasphemy, which is a sin committed 
directly against God, is more grave than murder, which is a sin against 
one's neighbor. On the other hand, if we compare them in respect of the 
harm wrought by them, murder is the graver sin, for murder does more harm 
to one's neighbor, than blasphemy does to God. Since, however, the 
gravity of a sin depends on the intention  of the evil will, rather than 
on the effect of the deed, as was shown above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>), it 
follows that, as the blasphemer intends to do harm to God's honor, 
absolutely speaking, he sins more grievously that the murderer. 
Nevertheless murder takes precedence, as to punishment, among sins 
committed against our neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A gloss on the words, "Let . . . blasphemy be put away from 
you" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++4:31">Eph. 4:31</a>) says: "Blasphemy is worse than perjury." The reason is 
that the perjurer does not say or think something false about God, as the 
blasphemer does: but he calls God to witness to a falsehood, not that he 
deems God a false witness, but in the hope, as it were, that God will not 
testify to the matter by some evident sign.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To excuse oneself for sin is a circumstance that aggravates 
every sin, even blasphemy itself: and it is called the most grievous sin, 
for as much as it makes every sin more grievous.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the damned blaspheme?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the damned do not blaspheme. Because some 
wicked men are deterred from blaspheming now, on account of the fear of 
future punishment. But the damned are undergoing these punishments, so 
that they abhor them yet more. Therefore, much more are they restrained 
from blaspheming.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, since blasphemy is a most grievous sin, it is most 
demeritorious. Now in the life to come there is no state of meriting or 
demeriting. Therefore there will be no place for blasphemy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eccles++11:3">Eccles. 11:3</a>) that "the tree . . . in 
what place soever it shall fall, there shall it be": whence it clearly 
follows that, after this life, man acquires neither merit nor sin, which 
he did not already possess in this life. Now many will be damned who were 
not blasphemous in this life. Neither, therefore, will they blaspheme in 
the life to come.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rev+++16:9">Apoc. 16:9</a>): "The men were scorched with 
great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, Who hath power over 
these plagues," and a gloss on these words says that "those who are in 
hell, though aware that they are deservedly punished, will nevertheless 
complain that God is so powerful as to torture them thus." Now this would 
be blasphemy in their present state: and consequently it will also be in 
their future state.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS013.html#SSQ13ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3), detestation of the Divine 
goodness is a necessary condition of blasphemy. Now those who are in hell 
retain their wicked will which is turned away from God's justice, since 
they love the things for which they are punished, would wish to use them 
if they could, and hate the punishments inflicted on them for those same 
sins. They regret  indeed the sins which they have committed, not because 
they hate them, but because they are punished for them. Accordingly this 
detestation of the Divine justice is, in them, the interior blasphemy of 
the heart: and it is credible that after the resurrection they will 
blaspheme God with the tongue, even as the saints will praise Him with 
their voices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the present life men are deterred from blasphemy through 
fear of punishment which they think they can escape: whereas, in hell, 
the damned have no hope of escape, so that, in despair, they are borne 
towards whatever their wicked will suggests to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Merit and demerit belong to the state of a wayfarer, 
wherefore good is meritorious in them, while evil is demeritorious. In 
the blessed, on the other hand, good is not meritorious, but is part of 
their blissful reward, and, in like manner, in the damned, evil is not 
demeritorious, but is part of the punishment of damnation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[13] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Whoever dies in mortal sin, bears with him a will that 
detests the Divine justice with regard to a certain thing, and in this 
respect there can be blasphemy in him.<br>
