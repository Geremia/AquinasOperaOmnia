    OF THE FRIENDLINESS WHICH IS CALLED AFFABILITY (TWO ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the friendliness which is called affability, and the
    opposite vices which are flattery and quarreling. Concerning friendliness or
    affability, there are two points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS114.html#SSQ114A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is a special virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS114.html#SSQ114A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a part of justice?

  <h3 align="left">Whether friendliness is a special virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that friendliness is not a special
    virtue. For the Philosopher says (Ethic. viii, 3) that "the perfect
    friendship is that which is on account of virtue." Now any virtue is the
    cause of friendship: "since the good is lovable to all," as Dionysius states
    (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore friendliness is not a special virtue, but a
    consequence of every virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 6) of
    this kind of friend that he "takes everything in a right manner both from
    those he loves and from those who are not his friends." Now it seems to
    pertain to simulation that a person should show signs of friendship to those
    whom he loves not, and this is incompatible with virtue. Therefore this kind
    of friendliness is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, virtue "observes the mean according as a
    wise man decides" (Ethic. ii, 6). Now it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++7%3A5"
      >Eccles. 7:5</a
    >): "The heart of the wise is where there is mourning, and the heart of
    fools where there is mirth": wherefore "it belongs to a virtuous man to be
    most wary of pleasure" (Ethic. ii, 9). Now this kind of friendship,
    according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 6), "is essentially desirous of
    sharing pleasures, but fears to give pain." Therefore this kind of
    friendliness is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The precepts of the law are about acts of
    virtue. Now it is written (Ecclus. 4:7): "Make thyself affable to the
    congregation of the poor." Therefore affability, which is what we mean by
    friendship, is a special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS109.html#SSQ109OUTP1"
      >Question [109]</a
    >, <a href="SS109.html#SSQ109A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), since virtue is
    directed to good, wherever there is a special kind of good, there must needs
    be a special kind of virtue. Now good consists in order, as stated above (<a
      href="SS109.html#SSQ109OUTP1"
      >Question [109]</a
    >, <a href="SS109.html#SSQ109A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). And it behooves man
    to be maintained in a becoming order towards other men as regards their
    mutual relations with one another, in point of both deeds and words, so that
    they behave towards one another in a becoming manner. Hence the need of a
    special virtue that maintains the becomingness of this order: and this
    virtue is called friendliness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher speaks of a twofold
    friendship in his Ethics. One consists chiefly in the affection whereby one
    man loves another and may result from any virtue. We have stated above, in
    treating of charity (<a href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>,
    <a href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>,
    <a href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1;
    <a href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [25]</a>,26), what things belong to
    this kind of friendship. But he mentions another friendliness, which
    consists merely in outward words or deeds; this has not the perfect nature
    of friendship, but bears a certain likeness thereto, in so far as a man
    behaves in a becoming manner towards those with whom he is in contact.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Every man is naturally every man's
    friend by a certain general love; even so it is written (Ecclus. 13:19) that
    "every beast loveth its like." This love is signified by signs of
    friendship, which we show outwardly by words or deeds, even to those who are
    strangers or unknown to us. Hence there is no dissimulation in this: because
    we do not show them signs of perfect friendship, for we do not treat
    strangers with the same intimacy as those who are united to us by special
    friendship.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When it is said that "the heart of the
    wise is where there is mourning" it is not that he may bring sorrow to his
    neighbor, for the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++14%3A15"
      >Rm. 14:15</a
    >): "If, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now
    according to charity": but that he may bring consolation to the sorrowful,
    according to Ecclus. 7:38, "Be not wanting in comforting them that weep, and
    walk with them that mourn." Again, "the heart of fools is where there is
    mirth," not that they may gladden others, but that they may enjoy others'
    gladness. Accordingly, it belongs to the wise man to share his pleasures
    with those among whom he dwells, not lustful pleasures, which virtue shuns,
    but honest pleasures, according to Ps. 132:1, "Behold how good and how
    pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 6), for the sake of some
    good that will result, or in order to avoid some evil, the virtuous man will
    sometimes not shrink from bringing sorrow to those among whom he lives.
    Hence the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++7%3A8"
      >2 Cor. 7:8</a
    >): "Although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent," and
    further on (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++7%3A9"
      >2 Cor. 7:9</a
    >), "I am glad; not because you were made sorrowful, but because you were
    made sorrowful unto repentance." For this reason we should not show a
    cheerful face to those who are given to sin, in order that we may please
    them, lest we seem to consent to their sin, and in a way encourage them to
    sin further. Hence it is written (Ecclus. 7:26): "Hast thou daughters? Have
    a care of their body, and show not thy countenance gay towards them."<br />

    Whether this kind of friendship is a part of justice?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that this kind of friendship is not a
    part of justice. For justice consists in giving another man his due. But
    this virtue does not consist in doing that, but in behaving agreeably
    towards those among whom we live. Therefore this virtue is not a part of
    justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv,
    6), this virtue is concerned about the joys and sorrows of those who dwell
    in fellowship. Now it belongs to temperance to moderate the greatest
    pleasures, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore this
    virtue is a part of temperance rather than of justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to give equal things to those who are
    unequal is contrary to justice, as stated above (<a
      href="SS059.html#SSQ59OUTP1"
      >Question [59]</a
    >, <a href="SS059.html#SSQ59ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Now, according to
    the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 6), this virtue "treats in like manner known and
    unknown, companions and strangers." Therefore this virtue rather than being
    a part of justice is opposed thereto.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Macrobius (De Somno Scip. i) accounts
    friendship a part of justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This virtue is a part of justice, being annexed
    to it as to a principal virtue. Because in common with justice it is
    directed to another person, even as justice is: yet it falls short of the
    notion of justice, because it lacks the full aspect of debt, whereby one man
    is bound to another, either by legal debt, which the law binds him to pay,
    or by some debt arising out of a favor received. For it regards merely a
    certain debt of equity, namely, that we behave pleasantly to those among
    whom we dwell, unless at times, for some reason, it be necessary to
    displease them for some good purpose.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As we have said above (<a
      href="SS109.html#SSQ109OUTP1"
      >Question [109]</a
    >, <a href="SS109.html#SSQ109A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1), because man is
    a social animal he owes his fellow-man, in equity, the manifestation of
    truth without which human society could not last. Now as man could not live
    in society without truth, so likewise, not without joy, because, as the
    Philosopher says (Ethic. viii), no one could abide a day with the sad nor
    with the joyless. Therefore, a certain natural equity obliges a man to live
    agreeably with his fellow-men; unless some reason should oblige him to
    sadden them for their good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It belongs to temperance to curb
    pleasures of the senses. But this virtue regards the pleasures of
    fellowship, which have their origin in the reason, in so far as one man
    behaves becomingly towards another. Such pleasures need not to be curbed as
    though they were noisome.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This saying of the Philosopher does not
    mean that one ought to converse and behave in the same way with
    acquaintances and strangers, since, as he says (Ethic. iv, 6), "it is not
    fitting to please and displease intimate friends and strangers in the same
    way." This likeness consists in this, that we ought to behave towards all in
    a fitting manner.<br />
