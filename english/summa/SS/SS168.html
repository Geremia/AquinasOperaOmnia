    OF MODESTY AS CONSISTING IN THE OUTWARD MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY (FOUR
    ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must next consider modesty as consisting in the outward movements of the
    body, and under this head there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS168.html#SSQ168A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there can be virtue and
    vice in the outward movements of the body that are done seriously?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS168.html#SSQ168A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether there can be a virtue
    about playful actions?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS168.html#SSQ168A3THEP1">(3)</a> Of the sin consisting in excess
    of play;
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS168.html#SSQ168A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of the sin consisting in lack of
    play.

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether any virtue regards the outward movements of the body?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no virtue regards the outward
    movements of the body. For every virtue pertains to the spiritual beauty of
    the soul, according to Ps. 44:14, "All the glory of the king's daughter is
    within," and a gloss adds, "namely, in the conscience." Now the movements of
    the body are not within, but without. Therefore there can be no virtue about
    them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "Virtues are not in us by nature," as
    the Philosopher states (Ethic. ii, 1). But outward bodily movements are in
    man by nature, since it is by nature that some are quick, and some slow of
    movement, and the same applies to other differences of outward movements.
    Therefore there is no virtue about movements of this kind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every moral virtue is either about
    actions directed to another person, as justice, or about passions, as
    temperance and fortitude. Now outward bodily movements are not directed to
    another person, nor are they passions. Therefore no virtue is connected with
    them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, study should be applied to all works of
    virtue, as stated above (<a href="SS166.html#SSQ166OUTP1">Question [166]</a
    >, <a href="SS166.html#SSQ166A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, Objection [1];
    <a href="SS166.html#SSQ166A1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1). Now it is
    censurable to apply study to the ordering of one's outward movements: for
    Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 18): "A becoming gait is one that reflects the
    carriage of authority, has the tread of gravity, and the foot-print of
    tranquillity: yet so that there be neither study nor affectation, but
    natural and artless movement." Therefore seemingly there is no virtue about
    the style of outward movements.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The beauty of honesty [*Cf. Question [145],
    Article [1]] pertains to virtue. Now the style of outward movements pertains
    to the beauty of honesty. For Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 18): "The sound of
    the voice and the gesture of the body are distasteful to me, whether they be
    unduly soft and nerveless, or coarse and boorish. Let nature be our model;
    her reflection is gracefulness of conduct and beauty of honesty." Therefore
    there is a virtue about the style of outward movement.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Moral virtue consists in the things pertaining
    to man being directed by his reason. Now it is manifest that the outward
    movements of man are dirigible by reason, since the outward members are set
    in motion at the command of reason. Hence it is evident that there is a
    moral virtue concerned with the direction of these movements.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the direction of these movements may be considered from a twofold
    standpoint. First, in respect of fittingness to the person; secondly, in
    respect of fittingness to externals, whether persons, business, or place.
    Hence Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 18): "Beauty of conduct consists in
    becoming behavior towards others, according to their sex and person," and
    this regards the first. As to the second, he adds: "This is the best way to
    order our behavior, this is the polish becoming to every action."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence Andronicus [*De Affectibus] ascribes two things to these outward
    movements: namely "taste" [ornatus] which regards what is becoming to the
    person, wherefore he says that it is the knowledge of what is becoming in
    movement and behavior; and "methodicalness" [bona ordinatio] which regards
    what is becoming to the business in hand, and to one's surroundings,
    wherefore he calls it "the practical knowledge of separation," i.e. of the
    distinction of "acts."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Outward movements are signs of the
    inward disposition, according to Ecclus. 19:27, "The attire of the body, and
    the laughter of the teeth, and the gait of the man, show what he is"; and
    Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 18) that "the habit of mind is seen in the
    gesture of the body," and that "the body's movement is an index of the
    soul."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although it is from natural disposition
    that a man is inclined to this or that style of outward movement,
    nevertheless what is lacking to nature can be supplied by the efforts of
    reason. Hence Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 18): "Let nature guide the
    movement: and if nature fail in any respect, surely effort will supply the
    defect."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated (ad 1) outward movements are
    indications of the inward disposition, and this regards chiefly the passions
    of the soul. Wherefore Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 18) that "from these
    things," i.e. the outward movements, "the man that lies hidden in our hearts
    is esteemed to be either frivolous, or boastful, or impure, or on the other
    hand sedate, steady, pure, and free from blemish." It is moreover from our
    outward movements that other men form their judgment about us, according to
    Ecclus. 19:26, "A man is known by his look, and a wise man, when thou
    meetest him, is known by his countenance." Hence moderation of outward
    movements is directed somewhat to other persons, according to the saying of
    Augustine in his Rule (Ep. ccxi), "In all your movements, let nothing be
    done to offend the eye of another, but only that which is becoming to the
    holiness of your state." Wherefore the moderation of outward movements may
    be reduced to two virtues, which the Philosopher mentions in Ethic. iv, 6,7.
    For, in so far as by outward movements we are directed to other persons, the
    moderation of our outward movements belongs to "friendliness or affability"
    [*Cf. Question [114], Article [1]]. This regards pleasure or pain which may
    arise from words or deeds in reference to others with whom a man comes in
    contact. And, in so far as outward movements are signs of our inward
    disposition, their moderation belongs to the virtue of truthfulness [*Cf.
    Question [9]], whereby a man, by word and deed, shows himself to be such as
    he is inwardly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> It is censurable to study the style of
    one's outward movements, by having recourse to pretense in them, so that
    they do not agree with one's inward disposition. Nevertheless it behooves
    one to study them, so that if they be in any way inordinate, this may be
    corrected. Hence Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 18): "Let them be without
    artifice, but not without correction."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether there can be a virtue about games?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there cannot be a virtue about
    games. For Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 23): "Our Lord said: 'Woe to you who
    laugh, for you shall weep.' Wherefore I consider that all, and not only
    excessive, games should be avoided." Now that which can be done virtuously
    is not to be avoided altogether. Therefore there cannot be a virtue about
    games.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "Virtue is that which God forms in us,
    without us," as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now Chrysostom
    says [*Hom. vi in Matth.]: "It is not God, but the devil, that is the author
    of fun. Listen to what happened to those who played: 'The people sat down to
    eat and drink, and they rose up to play.'" Therefore there can be no virtue
    about games.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 6) that
    "playful actions are not directed to something else." But it is a requisite
    of virtue that the agent in choosing should "direct his action to something
    else," as the Philosopher states (Ethic. ii, 4). Therefore there can be no
    virtue about games.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Music. ii, 15): "I pray thee,
    spare thyself at times: for it becomes a wise man sometimes to relax the
    high pressure of his attention to work." Now this relaxation of the mind
    from work consists in playful words or deeds. Therefore it becomes a wise
    and virtuous man to have recourse to such things at times. Moreover the
    Philosopher [*Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 8] assigns to games the virtue of
    {eutrapelia}, which we may call "pleasantness."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Just as man needs bodily rest for the body's
    refreshment, because he cannot always be at work, since his power is finite
    and equal to a certain fixed amount of labor, so too is it with his soul,
    whose power is also finite and equal to a fixed amount of work. Consequently
    when he goes beyond his measure in a certain work, he is oppressed and
    becomes weary, and all the more since when the soul works, the body is at
    work likewise, in so far as the intellective soul employs forces that
    operate through bodily organs. Now sensible goods are connatural to man, and
    therefore, when the soul arises above sensibles, through being intent on the
    operations of reason, there results in consequence a certain weariness of
    soul, whether the operations with which it is occupied be those of the
    practical or of the speculative reason. Yet this weariness is greater if the
    soul be occupied with the work of contemplation, since thereby it is raised
    higher above sensible things; although perhaps certain outward works of the
    practical reason entail a greater bodily labor. In either case, however, one
    man is more soul-wearied than another, according as he is more intensely
    occupied with works of reason. Now just as weariness of the body is
    dispelled by resting the body, so weariness of the soul must needs be
    remedied by resting the soul: and the soul's rest is pleasure, as stated
    above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS025.html#FSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS025.html#FSQ25A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS031.html#FSQ31OUTP1">Question [31]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS031.html#FSQ31A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2).
    Consequently, the remedy for weariness of soul must needs consist in the
    application of some pleasure, by slackening the tension of the reason's
    study. Thus in the Conferences of the Fathers xxiv, 21, it is related of
    Blessed John the Evangelist, that when some people were scandalized on
    finding him playing together with his disciples, he is said to have told one
    of them who carried a bow to shoot an arrow. And when the latter had done
    this several times, he asked him whether he could do it indefinitely, and
    the man answered that if he continued doing it, the bow would break. Whence
    the Blessed John drew the inference that in like manner man's mind would
    break if its tension were never relaxed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now such like words or deeds wherein nothing further is sought than the
    soul's delight, are called playful or humorous. Hence it is necessary at
    times to make use of them, in order to give rest, as it were, to the soul.
    This is in agreement with the statement of the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 8)
    that "in the intercourse of this life there is a kind of rest that is
    associated with games": and consequently it is sometimes necessary to make
    use of such things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless it would seem that in this matter there are three points which
    require especial caution. The first and chief is that the pleasure in
    question should not be sought in indecent or injurious deeds or words.
    Wherefore Tully says (De Offic. i, 29) that "one kind of joke is
    discourteous, insolent, scandalous, obscene." Another thing to be observed
    is that one lose not the balance of one's mind altogether. Hence Ambrose
    says (De Offic. i, 20): "We should beware lest, when we seek relaxation of
    mind, we destroy all that harmony which is the concord of good works": and
    Tully says (De Offic. i, 29), that, "just as we do not allow children to
    enjoy absolute freedom in their games, but only that which is consistent
    with good behavior, so our very fun should reflect something of an upright
    mind." Thirdly, we must be careful, as in all other human actions, to
    conform ourselves to persons, time, and place, and take due account of other
    circumstances, so that our fun "befit the hour and the man," as Tully says
    (De Offic. i, 29).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now these things are directed according to the rule of reason: and a habit
    that operates according to reason is virtue. Therefore there can be a virtue
    about games. The Philosopher gives it the name of wittiness ({eutrapelia}),
    and a man is said to be pleasant through having a happy turn* of mind,
    whereby he gives his words and deeds a cheerful turn: and inasmuch as this
    virtue restrains a man from immoderate fun, it is comprised under modesty.
    [*{Eutrapelia} is derived from {trepein} = 'to turn'].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above, fun should fit with
    business and persons; wherefore Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. i, 17) that
    "when the audience is weary, it will be useful for the speaker to try
    something novel or amusing, provided that joking be not incompatible with
    the gravity of the subject." Now the sacred doctrine is concerned with
    things of the greatest moment, according to Prov. 8:6, "Hear, for I will
    speak of great things." Wherefore Ambrose does not altogether exclude fun
    from human speech, but from the sacred doctrine; hence he begins by saying:
    "Although jokes are at times fitting and pleasant, nevertheless they are
    incompatible with the ecclesiastical rule; since how can we have recourse to
    things which are not to be found in Holy Writ?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This saying of Chrysostom refers to the
    inordinate use of fun, especially by those who make the pleasure of games
    their end; of whom it is written (Wis. 15:12): "They have accounted our life
    a pastime." Against these Tully says (De Offic. i, 29): "We are so begotten
    by nature that we appear to be made not for play and fun, but rather for
    hardships, and for occupations of greater gravity and moment."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Playful actions themselves considered in
    their species are not directed to an end: but the pleasure derived from such
    actions is directed to the recreation and rest of the soul, and accordingly
    if this be done with moderation, it is lawful to make use of fun. Hence
    Tully says (De Offic. i, 29): "It is indeed lawful to make use of play and
    fun, but in the same way as we have recourse to sleep and other kinds of
    rest, then only when we have done our duty by grave and serious matters."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether there can be sin in the excess of play?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there cannot be sin in the
    excess of play. For that which is an excuse for sin is not held to be
    sinful. Now play is sometimes an excuse for sin, for many things would be
    grave sins if they were done seriously, whereas if they be done in fun, are
    either no sin or but slightly sinful. Therefore it seems that there is no
    sin in excessive play.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, all other vices are reducible to the
    seven capital vices, as Gregory states (Moral. xxxi, 17). But excess of play
    does not seem reducible to any of the capital vices. Therefore it would seem
    not to be a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, comedians especially would seem to
    exceed in play, since they direct their whole life to playing. Therefore if
    excess of play were a sin, all actors would be in a state of sin; moreover
    all those who employ them, as well as those who make them any payment, would
    sin as accomplices of their sin. But this would seem untrue; for it is
    related in the Lives of the Fathers (ii. 16; viii. 63) that is was revealed
    to the Blessed Paphnutius that a certain jester would be with him in the
    life to come.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Prov. 14:13, "Laughter shall be
    mingled with sorrow and mourning taketh hold of the end of joy," remarks: "A
    mourning that will last for ever." Now there is inordinate laughter and
    inordinate joy in excessive play. Therefore there is mortal sin therein,
    since mortal sin alone is deserving of everlasting mourning.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In all things dirigible according to reason,
    the excessive is that which goes beyond, and the deficient is that which
    falls short of the rule of reason. Now it has been stated (<a
      href="SS168.html#SSQ168A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >) that playful or jesting words or deeds are dirigible according to reason.
    Wherefore excessive play is that which goes beyond the rule of reason: and
    this happens in two ways. First, on account of the very species of the acts
    employed for the purpose of fun, and this kind of jesting, according to
    Tully (De Offic. i, 29), is stated to be "discourteous, insolent,
    scandalous, and obscene," when to wit a man, for the purpose of jesting,
    employs indecent words or deeds, or such as are injurious to his neighbor,
    these being of themselves mortal sins. And thus it is evident that excessive
    play is a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, there may be excess in play, through lack of due circumstances:
    for instance when people make use of fun at undue times or places, or out of
    keeping with the matter in hand, or persons. This may be sometimes a mortal
    sin on account of the strong attachment to play, when a man prefers the
    pleasure he derives therefrom to the love of God, so as to be willing to
    disobey a commandment of God or of the Church rather than forego, such like
    amusements. Sometimes, however, it is a venial sin, for instance where a man
    is not so attached to amusement as to be willing for its sake to do anything
    in disobedience to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Certain things are sinful on account of
    the intention alone, because they are done in order to injure someone. Such
    an intention is excluded by their being done in fun, the intention of which
    is to please, not to injure: in these cases fun excuses from sin, or
    diminishes it. Other things, however, are sins according to their species,
    such as murder, fornication, and the like: and fun is no excuse for these;
    in fact they make fun scandalous and obscene.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Excessive play pertains to senseless
    mirth, which Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 17) calls a daughter of gluttony.
    Wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++32%3A6"
      >Ex. 32:6</a
    >): "The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play."<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated (<a
      href="SS168.html#SSQ168A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), play is necessary for the intercourse of human life. Now whatever is
    useful to human intercourse may have a lawful employment ascribed to it.
    Wherefore the occupation of play-actors, the object of which is to cheer the
    heart of man, is not unlawful in itself; nor are they in a state of sin
    provided that their playing be moderated, namely that they use no unlawful
    words or deeds in order to amuse, and that they do not introduce play into
    undue matters and seasons. And although in human affairs, they have no other
    occupation in reference to other men, nevertheless in reference to
    themselves, and to God, they perform other actions both serious and
    virtuous, such as prayer and the moderation of their own passions and
    operations, while sometimes they give alms to the poor. Wherefore those who
    maintain them in moderation do not sin but act justly, by rewarding them for
    their services. on the other hand, if a man spends too much on such persons,
    or maintains those comedians who practice unlawful mirth, he sins as
    encouraging them in their sin. Hence Augustine says (Tract. c. in Joan.)
    that "to give one's property to comedians is a great sin, not a virtue";
    unless by chance some play-actor were in extreme need, in which case one
    would have to assist him, for Ambrose says (De Offic. [*Quoted in Canon
    Pasce, dist. 86]): "Feed him that dies of hunger; for whenever thou canst
    save a man by feeding him, if thou hast not fed him, thou hast slain
    him."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether there is a sin in lack of mirth?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is no sin in lack of
    mirth. For no sin is prescribed to a penitent. But Augustine speaking of a
    penitent says (De Vera et Falsa Poenit. 15) [*Spurious]: "Let him refrain
    from games and the sights of the world, if he wishes to obtain the grace of
    a full pardon." Therefore there is no sin in lack of mirth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no sin is included in the praise given
    to holy men. But some persons are praised for having refrained from mirth;
    for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++15%3A17"
      >Jer. 15:17</a
    >): "I sat not in the assembly of jesters," and (Tobias 3:17): "Never have I
    joined myself with them that play; neither have I made myself partaker with
    them that walk in lightness." Therefore there can be no sin in the lack of
    mirth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Andronicus counts austerity to be one of
    the virtues, and he describes it as a habit whereby a man neither gives nor
    receives the pleasures of conversation. Now this pertains to the lack of
    mirth. Therefore the lack of mirth is virtuous rather than sinful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 8) reckons
    the lack of mirth to be a vice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In human affairs whatever is against reason is
    a sin. Now it is against reason for a man to be burdensome to others, by
    offering no pleasure to others, and by hindering their enjoyment. Wherefore
    Seneca [*Martin of Braga, Formula Vitae Honestae: cap. De Continentia] says
    (De Quat. Virt., cap. De Continentia): "Let your conduct be guided by wisdom
    so that no one will think you rude, or despise you as a cad." Now a man who
    is without mirth, not only is lacking in playful speech, but is also
    burdensome to others, since he is deaf to the moderate mirth of others.
    Consequently they are vicious, and are said to be boorish or rude, as the
    Philosopher states (Ethic. iv, 8).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Since, however, mirth is useful for the sake of the rest and pleasures it
    affords; and since, in human life, pleasure and rest are not in quest for
    their own sake, but for the sake of operation, as stated in Ethic. x, 6, it
    follows that "lack of mirth is less sinful than excess thereof." Hence the
    Philosopher says (Ethic. ix, 10): "We should make few friends for the sake
    of pleasure, since but little sweetness suffices to season life, just as
    little salt suffices for our meat."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Mirth is forbidden the penitent because
    he is called upon to mourn for his sins. Nor does this imply a vice in
    default, because this very diminishment of mirth in them is in accordance
    with reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Jeremias speaks there in accordance with
    the times, the state of which required that man should mourn; wherefore he
    adds: "I sat alone, because Thou hast filled me with threats." The words of
    Tobias 3 refer to excessive mirth; and this is evident from his adding:
    "Neither have I made myself partaker with them that walk in lightness."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Austerity, as a virtue, does not exclude
    all pleasures, but only such as are excessive and inordinate; wherefore it
    would seem to pertain to affability, which the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 6)
    calls "friendliness," or {eutrapelia}, otherwise wittiness. Nevertheless he
    names and defines it thus in respect of its agreement with temperance, to
    which it belongs to restrain pleasure.<br />
