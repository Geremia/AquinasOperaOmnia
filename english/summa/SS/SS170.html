    Whether the precepts of temperance are suitably given in the Divine law?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the precepts of temperance are
    unsuitably given in the Divine law. Because fortitude is a greater virtue
    than temperance, as stated above (<a href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1"
      >Question [123]</a
    >, <a href="SS123.html#SSQ123A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>;
    <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141OUTP1">Question [141]</a>,
    <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS066.html#FSQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS066.html#FSQ66A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now there is no
    precept of fortitude among the precepts of the decalogue, which are the most
    important among the precepts of the Law. Therefore it was unfitting to
    include among the precepts of the decalogue the prohibition of adultery,
    which is contrary to temperance, as stated above (<a
      href="SS154.html#SSQ154OUTP1"
      >Question [154]</a
    >, <a href="SS154.html#SSQ154ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,8).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, temperance is not only about venereal
    matters, but also about pleasures of meat and drink. Now the precepts of the
    decalogue include no prohibition of a vice pertaining to pleasures of meat
    and drink, or to any other species of lust. Neither, therefore, should they
    include a precept prohibiting adultery, which pertains to venereal
    pleasure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the lawgiver's intention inducement
    to virtue precedes the prohibition of vice, since vices are forbidden in
    order that obstacles to virtue may be removed. Now the precepts of the
    decalogue are the most important in the Divine law. Therefore the precepts
    of the decalogue should have included an affirmative precept directly
    prescribing the virtue of temperance, rather than a negative precept
    forbidding adultery which is directly opposed thereto.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the authority of Scripture in the
    decalogue (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++20%3A14,17"
      >Ex. 20:14,17</a
    >).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++1%3A5"
      >1 Tim. 1:5</a
    >), "the end of the commandment is charity," which is enjoined upon us in
    the two precepts concerning the love of God and of our neighbor. Wherefore
    the decalogue contains those precepts which tend more directly to the love
    of God and of our neighbor. Now among the vices opposed to temperance,
    adultery would seem most of all opposed to the love of our neighbor, since
    thereby a man lays hold of another's property for his own use, by abusing
    his neighbor's wife. Wherefore the precepts of the decalogue include a
    special prohibition of adultery, not only as committed in deed, but also as
    desired in thought.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Among the species of vices opposed to
    fortitude there is not one that is so directly opposed to the love of our
    neighbor as adultery, which is a species of lust that is opposed to
    temperance. And yet the vice of daring, which is opposed to fortitude, is
    wont to be sometimes the cause of murder, which is forbidden by one of the
    precepts of the decalogue: for it is written (Ecclus. 8:18): "Go not on the
    way with a bold man lest he burden thee with his evils."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Gluttony is not directly opposed to the
    love of our neighbor, as adultery is. Nor indeed is any other species of
    lust, for a father is not so wronged by the seduction of the virgin over
    whom he has no connubial right, as is the husband by the adultery of his
    wife, for he, not the wife herself, has power over her body [*1 Cor.
    7:4].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS122.html#SSQ122OUTP1"
      >Question [122]</a
    >, <a href="SS122.html#SSQ122ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4) the precepts of the
    decalogue are universal principles of the Divine law; hence they need to be
    common precepts. Now it was not possible to give any common affirmative
    precepts of temperance, because the practice of temperance varies according
    to different times, as Augustine remarks (De Bono Conjug. xv, 7), and
    according to different human laws and customs.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the precepts of the virtues annexed to temperance are suitably given
    in the Divine law?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the precepts of the virtues
    annexed to temperance are unsuitably given in the Divine law. For the
    precepts of the Decalogue, as stated above (<a
      href="SS170.html#SSQ170A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 3), are certain universal principles of the whole Divine law. Now
    "pride is the beginning of all sin," according to Ecclus. 10:15. Therefore
    among the precepts of the Decalogue there should have been one forbidding
    pride.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a place before all should have been
    given in the decalogue to those precepts by which men are especially induced
    to fulfil the Law, because these would seem to be the most important. Now
    since humility subjects man to God, it would seem most of all to dispose man
    to the fulfilment of the Divine law; wherefore obedience is accounted one of
    the degrees of humility, as stated above (<a href="SS161.html#SSQ161OUTP1"
      >Question [161]</a
    >, <a href="SS161.html#SSQ161A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>); and the same
    apparently applies to meekness, the effect of which is that a man does not
    contradict the Divine Scriptures, as Augustine observes (De Doctr. Christ.
    ii, 7). Therefore it seems that the Decalogue should have contained precepts
    of humility and meekness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it was stated in the foregoing Article
    that adultery is forbidden in the decalogue, because it is contrary to the
    love of our neighbor. But inordinateness of outward movements, which is
    contrary to modesty, is opposed to neighborly love: wherefore Augustine says
    in his Rule (Ep. ccxii): "In all your movements let nothing be done to
    offend the eye of any person whatever." Therefore it seems that this kind of
    inordinateness should also have been forbidden by a precept of the
    Decalogue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> suffices the authority of Scripture.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The virtues annexed to temperance may be
    considered in two ways: first, in themselves; secondly, in their effects.
    Considered in themselves they have no direct connection with the love of God
    or of our neighbor; rather do they regard a certain moderation of things
    pertaining to man himself. But considered in their effects, they may regard
    the love of God or of our neighbor: and in this respect the decalogue
    contains precepts that relate to the prohibition of the effects of the vices
    opposed to the parts of temperance. Thus the effect of anger, which is
    opposed to meekness, is sometimes that a man goes on to commit murder (and
    this is forbidden in the Decalogue), and sometimes that he refuses due honor
    to his parents, which may also be the result of pride, which leads many to
    transgress the precepts of the first table.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Pride is the beginning of sin, but it
    lies hidden in the heart; and its inordinateness is not perceived by all in
    common. Hence there was no place for its prohibition among the precepts of
    the Decalogue, which are like first self-evident principles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those precepts which are essentially an
    inducement to the observance of the Law presuppose the Law to be already
    given, wherefore they cannot be first precepts of the Law so as to have a
    place in the Decalogue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Inordinate outward movement is not
    injurious to one's neighbor, if we consider the species of the act, as are
    murder, adultery, and theft, which are forbidden in the decalogue; but only
    as being signs of an inward inordinateness, as stated above (<a
      href="SS168.html#SSQ168OUTP1"
      >Question [168]</a
    >, <a href="SS168.html#SSQ168A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1,3).
