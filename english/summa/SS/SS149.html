<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider sobriety and the contrary vice, namely drunkenness. 
As regards sobriety there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS149.html#SSQ149A1THEP1">(1)</a> What is the matter of sobriety?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS149.html#SSQ149A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a special virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS149.html#SSQ149A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the use of wine is lawful?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS149.html#SSQ149A4THEP1">(4)</a> To whom especially is sobriety becoming?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that drink is not the matter proper to sobriety. 
For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++12%3A3">Rm. 12:3</a>): "Not to be more wise than it behooveth to 
be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety." Therefore sobriety is also about 
wisdom, and not only about drink.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, concerning the wisdom of God, it is written (Wis. 8:7) 
that "she teacheth sobriety [Douay: 'temperance'], and prudence, and 
justice, and fortitude," where sobriety stands for temperance. Now 
temperance is not only about drink, but also about meat and sexual 
matters. Therefore sobriety is not only about drink.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sobriety would seem to take its name from "measure" 
[*'Bria,' a measure, a cup; Cf. Facciolati and Forcellini's Lexicon]. Now 
we ought to be guided by the measure in all things appertaining to us: 
for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Titus+2%3A12">Titus 2:12</a>): "We should live soberly and justly and 
godly," where a gloss remarks: "Soberly, in ourselves"; and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++2%3A9">1 Tim. 2:9</a>): 
"Women . . . in decent apparel, adorning themselves with modesty and 
sobriety." Consequently it would seem that sobriety regards not only the 
interior man, but also things appertaining to external apparel.  
Therefore drink is not the matter proper to sobriety.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 31:32): "Wine taken with 
sobriety is equal life to men; if thou drink it moderately, thou shalt be 
sober."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> When a virtue is denominated from some condition common 
to the virtues, the matter specially belonging to it is that in which it 
is most difficult and most commendable to satisfy that condition of 
virtue: thus fortitude is about dangers of death, and temperance about 
pleasures of touch. Now sobriety takes its name from "measure," for a man 
is said to be sober because he observes the "bria," i.e. the measure. 
Wherefore sobriety lays a special claim to that matter wherein /the 
observance of the measure is most deserving of praise. Such matter is the 
drinking of intoxicants, because the measured use thereof is most 
profitable, while immoderate excess therein is most harmful, since it 
hinders the use of reason even more than excessive eating. Hence it is 
written (Ecclus. 31:37,38): "Sober drinking is health to soul and body; 
wine drunken with excess raiseth quarrels, and wrath and many ruins." For 
this reason sobriety is especially concerned with drink, not any kind of 
drink, but that which by reason of its volatility is liable to disturb 
the brain, such as wine and all intoxicants. Nevertheless, sobriety may 
be employed in a general sense so as to apply to any matter, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141OUTP1">Question [141]</a>, <A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) with regard to fortitude and 
temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as the material wine intoxicates a man as to his body, 
so too, speaking figuratively, the consideration of wisdom is said to be 
an inebriating draught, because it allures the mind by its delight, 
according to Ps. 22:5, "My chalice which inebriateth me, how goodly is 
it!" Hence sobriety is applied by a kind of metaphor in speaking of the 
contemplation of wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All the things that belong properly to temperance are 
necessary to the present life, and their excess is harmful. Wherefore it 
behooves one to apply a measure in all such things. This is the business 
of sobriety: and for this reason sobriety is used to designate 
temperance. Yet slight excess is more harmful in drink than in other 
things, wherefore sobriety is especially concerned with drink.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although a measure is needful in all things, sobriety is 
not properly employed in connection with all things, but only in those 
wherein there is most need for a measure.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sobriety is not by itself a special virtue. 
For abstinence is concerned with both meat and drink. Now there is no 
special virtue about meat. Therefore neither is sobriety, which is about 
drink, a special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, abstinence and gluttony are about pleasures of touch as 
sensitive to food. Now meat and drink combine together to make food, 
since an animal needs a combination of wet and dry nourishment. Therefore 
sobriety, which is about drink, is not a. special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as in things pertaining to nourishment, drink is 
distinguished from meat, so are there various kinds of meats and of 
drinks. Therefore if sobriety is by itself a special virtue, seemingly 
there will be a special virtue corresponding to each different kind of 
meat or drink, which is unreasonable. Therefore it would seem that 
sobriety is not a special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Macrobius [*In Somno Scip. i, 8] reckons sobriety to be 
a special part of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS146.html#SSQ146OUTP1">Question [146]</a>, <A Href="SS146.html#SSQ146A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it belongs to moral 
virtue to safeguard the good of reason against those things which may 
hinder it. Hence wherever we find a special hindrance to reason, there 
must needs be a special virtue to remove it. Now intoxicating drink is a 
special kind of hindrance to the use of reason, inasmuch as it disturbs 
the brain by its fumes. Wherefore in order to remove this hindrance to 
reason a special virtue, which is sobriety, is requisite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Meat and drink are alike capable of hindering the good of 
reason, by embroiling the reason with immoderate pleasure: and in this 
respect abstinence is about both meat and drink alike. But intoxicating 
drink is a special kind of hindrance, as stated above, wherefore it 
requires a special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The virtue of abstinence is about meat and drink, 
considered, not as food but as a hindrance to reason. Hence it does not 
follow that special kinds of virtue correspond to different kinds of food.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In all intoxicating drinks there is one kind of hindrance 
to the use of reason: so that the difference of drinks bears an 
accidental relation to virtue. Hence this difference does not call for a 
difference of virtue. The same applies to the difference of meats.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the use of wine is altogether unlawful?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the use of wine is altogether unlawful. For 
without wisdom, a man cannot be in the state of salvation: since it is 
written (Wis. 7:28): "God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom," 
and further on (Wis. 9:19): "By wisdom they were healed, whosoever have 
pleased Thee, O Lord, from the beginning." Now the use of wine is a 
hindrance to wisdom, for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eccles++2%3A3">Eccles. 2:3</a>): "I thought in my 
heart to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind to 
wisdom." Therefore wine-drinking is altogether unlawful. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++14%3A21">Rm. 14:21</a>): "It is good not to eat 
flesh, and not to drink wine, nor anything whereby thy brother is 
offended or scandalized, or made weak." Now it is sinful to forsake the 
good of virtue, as likewise to scandalize one's brethren. Therefore it is 
unlawful to make use of wine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Jerome says [*Contra Jovin. i] that "after the deluge 
wine and flesh were sanctioned: but Christ came in the last of the ages 
and brought back the end into line with the beginning." Therefore it 
seems unlawful to use wine under the Christian law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++5%3A23">1 Tim. 5:23</a>): "Do not still drink 
water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake, and thy frequent 
infirmities"; and it is written (Ecclus. 31:36): "Wine drunken with 
moderation is the joy of the soul and the heart."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> No meat or drink, considered in itself, is unlawful, 
according to Mt. 15:11, "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a 
man." Wherefore it is not unlawful to drink wine as such. Yet it may 
become unlawful accidentally. This is sometimes owing to a circumstance 
on the part of the drinker, either because he is easily the worse for 
taking wine, or because he is bound by a vow not to drink wine: sometimes 
it results from the mode of drinking, because to wit he exceeds the 
measure in drinking: and sometimes it is on account of others who would 
be scandalized thereby.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A man may have wisdom in two ways. First, in a general way, 
according as it is sufficient for salvation: and in this way it is 
required, in order to have wisdom, not that a man abstain altogether from 
wine, but that he abstain from its immoderate use. Secondly, a man may 
have wisdom in some degree of perfection: and in this way, in order to 
receive wisdom perfectly, it is requisite for certain persons that they 
abstain altogether from wine, and this depends on circumstances of 
certain persons and places.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Apostle does not declare simply that it is good to 
abstain from wine, but that it is good in the case where this would give 
scandal to certain people.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ withdraws us from some things as being altogether 
unlawful, and from others as being obstacles to perfection. It is in the 
latter way that he withdraws some from the use of wine, that they may aim 
at perfection, even as from riches and the like.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sobriety is more requisite in persons of 
greater standing. For old age gives a man a certain standing; wherefore 
honor and reverence are due to the old,  according to Lev. 19:32, "Rise 
up before the hoary head, and honor the person of the aged man." Now the 
Apostle declares that old men especially should be exhorted to sobriety, 
according to Titus 2:2, "That the aged man be sober." Therefore sobriety 
is most requisite in persons of standing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a bishop has the highest degree in the Church: and the 
Apostle commands him to be sober, according to 1 Tim. 3:2, "It behooveth 
. . . a bishop to be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober, prudent," 
etc. Therefore sobriety is chiefly required in persons of high standing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sobriety denotes abstinence from wine. Now wine is 
forbidden to kings, who hold the highest place in human affairs: while it 
is allowed to those who are in a state of affliction, according to Prov. 
31:4, "Give not wine to kings," and further on (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++31%3A6">Prov. 31:6</a>), "Give strong 
drink to them that are sad, and wine to them that are grieved in mind." 
Therefore sobriety is more requisite in persons of standing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++3%3A11">1 Tim. 3:11</a>): "The women in like 
manner, chaste . . . sober," etc., and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Titus+2%3A6">Titus 2:6</a>) "Young men in like 
manner exhort that they be sober."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[149] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Virtue includes relationship to two things, to the 
contrary vices which it removes, and to the end to which it leads. 
Accordingly a particular virtue is more requisite in certain persons for 
two reasons. First, because they are more prone to the concupiscences 
which need to be restrained by virtue, and to the vices which are removed 
by virtue. In this respect, sobriety is most requisite in the young and 
in women, because concupiscence of pleasure thrives in the young on 
account of the heat of youth, while in women there is not sufficient 
strength of mind to resist concupiscence. Hence, according to Valerius 
Maximus [*Dict. Fact. Memor. ii, 1] among the ancient Romans women drank 
no wine. Secondly, sobriety is more requisite in certain persons, as 
being more necessary for the operations proper to them. Now immoderate 
use of wine is a notable obstacle to the use of reason: wherefore 
sobriety is specially prescribed to the old, in whom reason should be 
vigorous in instructing others: to bishops and all ministers of the 
Church, who should fulfil their spiritual duties with a devout mind; and 
to kings, who should rule their subjects with wisdom.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.
