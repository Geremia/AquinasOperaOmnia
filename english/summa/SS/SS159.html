  <p>
    We must now consider cruelty, under which head there are two points of
    inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS159.html#SSQ159A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether cruelty is opposed to
    clemency?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS159.html#SSQ159A2THEP1">(2)</a> Of its comparison with savagery
    or brutality.

  <h3 align="left">Whether cruelty is opposed to clemency?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that cruelty is not opposed to
    clemency. For Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 4) that "those are said to be
    cruel who exceed in punishing," which is contrary to justice. Now clemency
    is reckoned a part, not of justice but of temperance. Therefore apparently
    cruelty is not opposed to clemency.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++6%3A23"
      >Jer. 6:23</a
    >): "They are cruel, and will have no mercy"; so that cruelty would seem
    opposed to mercy. Now mercy is not the same as clemency, as stated above (<a
      href="SS157.html#SSQ157OUTP1"
      >Question [157]</a
    >, <a href="SS157.html#SSQ157A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 3). Therefore
    cruelty is not opposed to clemency.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, clemency is concerned with the
    infliction of punishment, as stated above (<a href="SS157.html#SSQ157OUTP1"
      >Question [157]</a
    >, <a href="SS157.html#SSQ157A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>): whereas cruelty
    applies to the withdrawal of beneficence, according to Prov. 11:17, "But he
    that is cruel casteth off even his own kindred." Therefore cruelty is not
    opposed to clemency.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 4) that "the
    opposite of clemency is cruelty, which is nothing else but hardness of heart
    in exacting punishment."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Cruelty apparently takes its name from
    "cruditas" [rawness]. Now just as things when cooked and prepared are wont
    to have an agreeable and sweet savor, so when raw they have a disagreeable
    and bitter taste. Now it has been stated above (<a
      href="SS157.html#SSQ157OUTP1"
      >Question [157]</a
    >, <a href="SS157.html#SSQ157A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1;
    <a href="SS157.html#SSQ157A3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 3) that clemency
    denotes a certain smoothness or sweetness of soul, whereby one is inclined
    to mitigate punishment. Hence cruelty is directly opposed to clemency.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as it belongs to equity to mitigate
    punishment according to reason, while the sweetness of soul which inclines
    one to this belongs to clemency: so too, excess in punishing, as regards the
    external action, belongs to injustice; but as regards the hardness of heart,
    which makes one ready to increase punishment, belongs to cruelty.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Mercy and clemency concur in this, that
    both shun and recoil from another's unhappiness, but in different ways. For
    it belongs to mercy [*Cf. Question [30], Article [1]] to relieve another's
    unhappiness by a beneficent action, while it belongs to clemency to mitigate
    another's unhappiness by the cessation of punishment. And since cruelty
    denotes excess in exacting punishment, it is more directly opposed to
    clemency than to mercy; yet on account of the mutual likeness of these
    virtues, cruelty is sometimes taken for mercilessness.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Cruelty is there taken for
    mercilessness, which is lack of beneficence. We may also reply that
    withdrawal of beneficence is in itself a punishment.<br />

    Whether cruelty differs from savagery or brutality?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that cruelty differs not from
    savagery or brutality. For seemingly one vice is opposed in one way to one
    virtue. Now both savagery and cruelty are opposed to clemency by way of
    excess. Therefore it would seem that savagery and cruelty are the same.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Isidore says (Etym. x) that "severity is
    as it were savagery with verity, because it holds to justice without
    attending to piety": so that savagery would seem to exclude that mitigation
    of punishment in delivering judgment which is demanded by piety. Now this
    has been stated to belong to cruelty (<a href="SS159.html#SSQ159A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 1). Therefore cruelty is the same as savagery.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as there is a vice opposed to a
    virtue by way of excess, so is there a vice opposed to it by way of
    deficiency, which latter is opposed both to the virtue which is the mean,
    and to the vice which is in excess. Now the same vice pertaining to
    deficiency is opposed to both cruelty and savagery, namely remission or
    laxity. For Gregory says (Moral. xx, 5): "Let there be love, but not that
    which enervates, let there be severity, but without fury, let there be zeal
    without unseemly savagery, let there be piety without undue clemency."
    Therefore savagery is the same as cruelty.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 4) that "a man
    who is angry without being hurt, or with one who has not offended him, is
    not said to be cruel, but to be brutal or savage."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> "Savagery" and "brutality" take their names
    from a likeness to wild beasts which are also described as savage. For
    animals of this kind attack man that they may feed on his body, and not for
    some motive of justice the consideration of which belongs to reason alone.
    Wherefore, properly speaking, brutality or savagery applies to those who in
    inflicting punishment have not in view a default of the person punished, but
    merely the pleasure they derive from a man's torture. Consequently it is
    evident that it is comprised under bestiality: for such like pleasure is not
    human but bestial, and resulting as it does either from evil custom, or from
    a corrupt nature, as do other bestial emotions. On the other hand, cruelty
    not only regards the default of the person punished, but exceeds in the mode
    of punishing: wherefore cruelty differs from savagery or brutality, as human
    wickedness differs from bestiality, as stated in Ethic. vii, 5.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Clemency is a human virtue; wherefore
    directly opposed to it is cruelty which is a form of human wickedness. But
    savagery or brutality is comprised under bestiality, wherefore it is
    directly opposed not to clemency, but to a more excellent virtue, which the
    Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 5) calls "heroic" or "god-like," which according to
    us, would seem to pertain to the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Consequently we
    may say that savagery is directly opposed to the gift of piety.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A severe man is not said to be simply
    savage, because this implies a vice; but he is said to be "savage as regards
    the truth," on account of some likeness to savagery which is not inclined to
    mitigate punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Remission of punishment is not a vice,
    except it disregard the order of justice, which requires a man to be
    punished on account of his offense, and which cruelty exceeds. On the other
    hand, cruelty disregards this order altogether. Wherefore remission of
    punishment is opposed to cruelty, but not to savagery.<br />
