<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that cruelty is not opposed to clemency. For Seneca 
says (De Clementia ii, 4) that "those are said to be cruel who exceed in 
punishing," which is contrary to justice. Now clemency is reckoned a 
part, not of justice but of temperance. Therefore apparently cruelty is 
not opposed to clemency.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jer++6:23">Jer. 6:23</a>): "They are cruel, and will 
have no mercy"; so that cruelty would seem opposed to mercy. Now mercy is 
not the same as clemency, as stated above (<A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157OUTP1">Question [157]</a>, <A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 3). Therefore 
cruelty is not opposed to clemency.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, clemency is concerned with the infliction of punishment, 
as stated above (<A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157OUTP1">Question [157]</a>, <A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>): whereas cruelty applies to the withdrawal 
of beneficence, according to Prov. 11:17, "But he that is cruel casteth 
off even his own kindred." Therefore cruelty is not opposed to clemency.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 4) that "the opposite of 
clemency is cruelty, which is nothing else but hardness of heart in 
exacting punishment."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Cruelty apparently takes its name from "cruditas" 
[rawness]. Now just as things when cooked and prepared are wont to have 
an agreeable and sweet savor, so when raw they have a disagreeable and 
bitter taste. Now it has been stated above (<A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157OUTP1">Question [157]</a>, <A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157A3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 3) that clemency denotes a certain smoothness or sweetness of soul, 
whereby one is inclined to mitigate punishment. Hence cruelty is directly 
opposed to clemency.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as it belongs to equity to mitigate punishment 
according to reason, while the sweetness of soul which inclines one to 
this belongs to clemency: so too, excess in punishing, as regards the 
external action, belongs to injustice; but as regards the hardness of 
heart, which makes one ready to increase punishment, belongs to cruelty.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Mercy and clemency concur in this, that both shun and 
recoil from another's unhappiness, but in different ways. For it belongs 
to mercy [*Cf. Question [30], Article [1]] to relieve another's unhappiness by a 
beneficent action, while it belongs to clemency to mitigate another's 
unhappiness by the cessation of punishment. And since cruelty denotes 
excess in exacting punishment, it is more directly opposed to clemency 
than to mercy; yet on account of the mutual likeness of these virtues, 
cruelty is sometimes taken for mercilessness. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Cruelty is there taken for mercilessness, which is lack of 
beneficence. We may also reply that withdrawal of beneficence is in 
itself a punishment.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether cruelty differs from savagery or brutality?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that cruelty differs not from savagery or 
brutality. For seemingly one vice is opposed in one way to one virtue. 
Now both savagery and cruelty are opposed to clemency by way of excess. 
Therefore it would seem that savagery and cruelty are the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Isidore says (Etym. x) that "severity is as it were 
savagery with verity, because it holds to justice without attending to 
piety": so that savagery would seem to exclude that mitigation of 
punishment in delivering judgment which is demanded by piety. Now this 
has been stated to belong to cruelty (<A Href="SS159.html#SSQ159A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1). Therefore cruelty is 
the same as savagery.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as there is a vice opposed to a virtue by way of 
excess, so is there a vice opposed to it by way of deficiency, which 
latter is opposed both to the virtue which is the mean, and to the vice 
which is in excess. Now the same vice pertaining to deficiency is opposed 
to both cruelty and savagery, namely remission or laxity. For Gregory 
says (Moral. xx, 5): "Let there be love, but not that which enervates, 
let there be severity, but without fury, let there be zeal without 
unseemly savagery, let there be piety without undue clemency." Therefore 
savagery is the same as cruelty.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 4) that "a man who is 
angry without being hurt, or with one who has not offended him, is not 
said to be cruel, but to be brutal or savage."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> "Savagery" and "brutality" take their names from a 
likeness to wild beasts which are also described as savage. For animals 
of this kind attack man that they may feed on his body, and not for some 
motive of justice the consideration of which belongs to reason alone. 
Wherefore, properly speaking, brutality or savagery applies to those who 
in inflicting punishment have not in view a default of the person 
punished, but merely the pleasure they derive from a man's torture. 
Consequently it is evident that it is comprised under bestiality: for 
such like pleasure is not human but bestial, and resulting as it does 
either from evil custom, or from a corrupt nature, as do other bestial 
emotions. On the other hand, cruelty not only regards the default of the 
person punished, but exceeds in the mode of punishing: wherefore cruelty 
differs from savagery or brutality, as human wickedness differs from 
bestiality, as stated in Ethic. vii, 5.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Clemency is a human virtue; wherefore directly opposed to 
it is cruelty which is a form of human wickedness. But  savagery or 
brutality is comprised under bestiality, wherefore it is directly opposed 
not to clemency, but to a more excellent virtue, which the Philosopher 
(Ethic. vii, 5) calls "heroic" or "god-like," which according to us, 
would seem to pertain to the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Consequently we may 
say that savagery is directly opposed to the gift of piety.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A severe man is not said to be simply savage, because this 
implies a vice; but he is said to be "savage as regards the truth," on 
account of some likeness to savagery which is not inclined to mitigate 
punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[159] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Remission of punishment is not a vice, except it disregard 
the order of justice, which requires a man to be punished on account of 
his offense, and which cruelty exceeds. On the other hand, cruelty 
disregards this order altogether. Wherefore remission of punishment is 
opposed to cruelty, but not to savagery.<br>
