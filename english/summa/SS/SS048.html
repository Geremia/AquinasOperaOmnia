    Whether three parts of prudence are fittingly assigned?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the parts of prudence are
    assigned unfittingly. Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 53) assigns three parts of
    prudence, namely, "memory," "understanding" and "foresight." Macrobius (In
    Somn. Scip. i) following the opinion of Plotinus ascribes to prudence six
    parts, namely, "reasoning," "understanding," "circumspection," "foresight,"
    "docility" and "caution." Aristotle says (Ethic. vi, 9,10,11) that "good
    counsel," "synesis" and "gnome" belong to prudence. Again under the head of
    prudence he mentions "conjecture," "shrewdness," "sense" and
    "understanding." And another Greek philosopher [*Andronicus; Cf. Question
    [80], Objection [4]] says that ten things are connected with prudence,
    namely, "good counsel," "shrewdness," "foresight," "regnative [*Regnativa],"
    "military," "political" and "domestic prudence," "dialectics," "rhetoric"
    and "physics." Therefore it seems that one or the other enumeration is
    either excessive or deficient.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prudence is specifically distinct from
    science. But politics, economics, logic, rhetoric, physics are sciences.
    Therefore they are not parts of prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the parts do not exceed the whole. Now
    the intellective memory or intelligence, reason, sense and docility, belong
    not only to prudence but also to all the cognitive habits. Therefore they
    should not be set down as parts of prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, just as counselling, judging and
    commanding are acts of the practical reason, so also is using, as stated
    above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS016.html#FSQ16OUTP1">Question [16]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS016.html#FSQ16A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore, just as
    "eubulia" which refers to counsel, is connected with prudence, and "synesis"
    and "gnome" which refer to judgment, so also ought something to have been
    assigned corresponding to use.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, solicitude pertains to prudence, as
    stated above (<a href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>,
    <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>). Therefore solicitude
    also should have been mentioned among the parts of prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Parts are of three kinds, namely, "integral,"
    as wall, roof, and foundations are parts of a house; "subjective," as ox and
    lion are parts of animal; and "potential," as the nutritive and sensitive
    powers are parts of the soul. Accordingly, parts can be assigned to a virtue
    in three ways. First, in likeness to integral parts, so that the things
    which need to concur for the perfect act of a virtue, are called the parts
    of that virtue. In this way, out of all the things mentioned above, eight
    may be taken as parts of prudence, namely, the six assigned by Macrobius;
    with the addition of a seventh, viz. "memory" mentioned by Tully; and
    {eustochia} or "shrewdness" mentioned by Aristotle. For the "sense" of
    prudence is also called "understanding": wherefore the Philosopher says
    (Ethic. vi, 11): "Of such things one needs to have the sense, and this is
    understanding." Of these eight, five belong to prudence as a cognitive
    virtue, namely, "memory," "reasoning," "understanding," "docility" and
    "shrewdness": while the three others belong thereto, as commanding and
    applying knowledge to action, namely, "foresight," "circumspection" and
    "caution." The reason of their difference is seen from the fact that three
    things may be observed in reference to knowledge. In the first place,
    knowledge itself, which, if it be of the past, is called "memory," if of the
    present, whether contingent or necessary, is called "understanding" or
    "intelligence." Secondly, the acquiring of knowledge, which is caused either
    by teaching, to which pertains "docility," or by "discovery," and to this
    belongs to {eustochia}, i.e. "a happy conjecture," of which "shrewdness" is
    a part, which is a "quick conjecture of the middle term," as stated in
    Poster. i, 9. Thirdly, the use of knowledge, in as much as we proceed from
    things known to knowledge or judgment of other things, and this belongs to
    "reasoning." And the reason, in order to command aright, requires to have
    three conditions. First, to order that which is befitting the end, and this
    belongs to "foresight"; secondly, to attend to the circumstances of the
    matter in hand, and this belongs to "circumspection"; thirdly, to avoid
    obstacles, and this belongs to "caution."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The subjective parts of a virtue are its various species. In this way the
    parts of prudence, if we take them properly, are the prudence whereby a man
    rules himself, and the prudence whereby a man governs a multitude, which
    differ specifically as stated above (<a href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1"
      >Question [47]</a
    >, <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A11THEP1">Article [11]</a>). Again, the prudence
    whereby a multitude is governed, is divided into various species according
    to the various kinds of multitude. There is the multitude which is united
    together for some particular purpose; thus an army is gathered together to
    fight, and the prudence that governs this is called "military." There is
    also the multitude that is united together for the whole of life; such is
    the multitude of a home or family, and this is ruled by "domestic prudence":
    and such again is the multitude of a city or kingdom, the ruling principle
    of which is "regnative prudence" in the ruler, and "political prudence,"
    simply so called, in the subjects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, prudence be taken in a wide sense, as including also
    speculative knowledge, as stated above (<a href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1"
      >Question [47]</a
    >, <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2) then its parts
    include "dialectics," "rhetoric" and "physics," according to three methods
    of prudence in the sciences. The first of these is the attaining of science
    by demonstration, which belongs to "physics" (if physics be understood to
    comprise all demonstrative sciences). The second method is to arrive at an
    opinion through probable premises, and this belongs to "dialectics." The
    third method is to employ conjectures in order to induce a certain
    suspicion, or to persuade somewhat, and this belongs to "rhetoric." It may
    be said, however, that these three belong also to prudence properly so
    called, since it argues sometimes from necessary premises, sometimes from
    probabilities, and sometimes from conjectures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The potential parts of a virtue are the virtues connected with it, which are
    directed to certain secondary acts or matters, not having, as it were, the
    whole power of the principal virtue. In this way the parts of prudence are
    "good counsel," which concerns counsel, "synesis," which concerns judgment
    in matters of ordinary occurrence, and "gnome," which concerns judgment in
    matters of exception to the law: while "prudence" is about the chief act,
    viz. that of commanding.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The various enumerations differ, either
    because different kinds of parts are assigned, or because that which is
    mentioned in one enumeration includes several mentioned in another
    enumeration. Thus Tully includes "caution" and "circumspection" under
    "foresight," and "reasoning," "docility" and "shrewdness" under
    "understanding."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Here domestic and civic prudence are not
    to be taken as sciences, but as kinds of prudence. As to the other three,
    the reply may be gathered from what has been said.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All these things are reckoned parts of
    prudence, not by taking them altogether, but in so far as they are connected
    with things pertaining to prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Right command and right use always go
    together, because the reason's command is followed by obedience on the part
    of the lower powers, which pertain to use.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Solicitude is included under foresight.
