  <h3 align="center">OF THE GIFT OF FORTITUDE (TWO ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must next consider the gift corresponding to fortitude, and this is the
    gift of fortitude. Under this head there are two points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS139.html#SSQ139A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether fortitude is a gift?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS139.html#SSQ139A2THEP1">(2)</a> Which among the beatitudes and
    fruits correspond to it?

  <h3 align="left">Whether fortitude is a gift?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that fortitude is not a gift. For the
    virtues differ from the gifts: and fortitude is a virtue. Therefore it
    should not be reckoned a gift.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the acts of the gift remain in heaven,
    as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). But the act of
    fortitude does not remain in heaven: for Gregory says (Moral. i) that
    "fortitude encourages the fainthearted against hardships, which will be
    altogether absent from heaven." Therefore fortitude is not a gift.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. ii)
    that "it is a sign of fortitude to cut oneself adrift from all the deadly
    pleasures of the passing show." Now noisome pleasures and delights are the
    concern of temperance rather than of fortitude. Therefore it seems that
    fortitude is not the gift corresponding to the virtue of fortitude.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Fortitude is reckoned among the other gifts
    of the Holy Ghost (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++11%3A2"
      >Is. 11:2</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Fortitude denotes a certain firmness of mind,
    as stated above (<a href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>,
    <a href="SS123.html#SSQ123A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): and this firmness
    of mind is required both in doing good and in enduring evil, especially with
    regard to goods or evils that are difficult. Now man, according to his
    proper and connatural mode, is able to have this firmness in both these
    respects, so as not to forsake the good on account of difficulties, whether
    in accomplishing an arduous work, or in enduring grievous evil. In this
    sense fortitude denotes a special or general virtue, as stated above (<a
      href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1"
      >Question [123]</a
    >, <a href="SS123.html#SSQ123A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet furthermore man's mind is moved by the Holy Ghost, in order that he may
    attain the end of each work begun, and avoid whatever perils may threaten.
    This surpasses human nature: for sometimes it is not in a man's power to
    attain the end of his work, or to avoid evils or dangers, since these may
    happen to overwhelm him in death. But the Holy Ghost works this in man, by
    bringing him to everlasting life, which is the end of all good deeds, and
    the release from all perils. A certain confidence of this is infused into
    the mind by the Holy Ghost Who expels any fear of the contrary. It is in
    this sense that fortitude is reckoned a gift of the Holy Ghost. For it has
    been stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2) that the gifts
    regard the motion of the mind by the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Fortitude, as a virtue, perfects the
    mind in the endurance of all perils whatever; but it does not go so far as
    to give confidence of overcoming all dangers: this belongs to the fortitude
    that is a gift of the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The gifts have not the same acts in
    heaven as on the way: for they exercise acts in connection with the
    enjoyment of the end. Hence the act of fortitude there is to enjoy full
    security from toil and evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The gift of fortitude regards the virtue
    of fortitude not only because it consists in enduring dangers, but also
    inasmuch as it consists in accomplishing any difficult work. Wherefore the
    gift of fortitude is directed by the gift of counsel, which seems to be
    concerned chiefly with the greater goods.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the fourth beatitude: "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after
    justice," corresponds to the gift of fortitude?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the fourth beatitude, "Blessed are
    they that hunger and thirst after justice," does not correspond to the gift
    of fortitude. For the gift of piety and not the gift of fortitude
    corresponds to the virtue of justice. Now hungering and thirsting after
    justice pertain to the act of justice. Therefore this beatitude corresponds
    to the gift of piety rather than to the gift of fortitude.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, hunger and thirst after justice imply a
    desire for good. Now this belongs properly to charity, to which the gift of
    wisdom, and not the gift of fortitude, corresponds, as stated above (<a
      href="SS045.html#SSQ45OUTP1"
      >Question [45]</a
    >). Therefore this beatitude corresponds, not to the gift of fortitude, but
    to the gift of wisdom.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the fruits are consequent upon the
    beatitudes, since delight is essential to beatitude, according to Ethic. i,
    8. Now the fruits, apparently, include none pertaining to fortitude.
    Therefore neither does any beatitude correspond to it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i):
    "Fortitude becomes the hungry and thirsty: since those who desire to enjoy
    true goods, and wish to avoid loving earthly and material things, must
    toil."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS121.html#SSQ121OUTP1"
      >Question [121]</a
    >, <a href="SS121.html#SSQ121A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), Augustine makes the
    beatitudes correspond to the gifts according to the order in which they are
    set forth, observing at the same time a certain fittingness between them.
    Wherefore he ascribes the fourth beatitude, concerning the hunger and thirst
    for justice, to the fourth gift, namely fortitude.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet there is a certain congruity between them, because, as stated (<a
      href="SS139.html#SSQ139A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), fortitude is about difficult things. Now it is very difficult, not
    merely to do virtuous deeds, which receive the common designation of works
    of justice, but furthermore to do them with an unsatiable desire, which may
    be signified by hunger and thirst for justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Chrysostom says (Hom. xv in Matth.),
    we may understand here not only particular, but also universal justice,
    which is related to all virtuous deeds according to Ethic. v, 1, wherein
    whatever is hard is the object of that fortitude which is a gift.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Charity is the root of all the virtues
    and gifts, as stated above (<a href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a
    >, <a href="SS023.html#SSQ23A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>, ad 3;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 3). Hence
    whatever pertains to fortitude may also be referred to charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There are two of the fruits which
    correspond sufficiently to the gift of fortitude: namely, patience, which
    regards the enduring of evils: and longanimity, which may regard the long
    delay and accomplishment of goods.<br />
