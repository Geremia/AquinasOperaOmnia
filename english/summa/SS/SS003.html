  <h3 align="center">OF THE OUTWARD ACT OF FAITH (TWO ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the outward act, viz. the confession of faith: under
    which head there are two points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS003.html#SSQ3A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether confession is an act of
    faith?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS003.html#SSQ3A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether confession of faith is
    necessary for salvation?

  <h3 align="left">Whether confession is an act of faith?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that confession is not an act of
    faith. For the same act does not belong to different virtues. Now confession
    belongs to penance of which it is a part. Therefore it is not an act of
    faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, man is sometimes deterred by fear or
    some kind of confusion, from confessing his faith: wherefore the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++6%3A19"
      >Eph. 6:19</a
    >) asks for prayers that it may be granted him "with confidence, to make
    known the mystery of the gospel." Now it belongs to fortitude, which
    moderates daring and fear, not to be deterred from doing good on account of
    confusion or fear. Therefore it seems that confession is not an act of
    faith, but rather of fortitude or constancy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the ardor of faith makes one
    confess one's faith outwardly, so does it make one do other external good
    works, for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A6"
      >Gal. 5:6</a
    >) that "faith... worketh by charity." But other external works are not
    reckoned acts of faith. Therefore neither is confession an act of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss explains the words of 2 Thess. 1:11,
    "and the work of faith in power" as referring to "confession which is a work
    proper to faith."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Outward actions belong properly to the virtue
    to whose end they are specifically referred: thus fasting is referred
    specifically to the end of abstinence, which is to tame the flesh, and
    consequently it is an act of abstinence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now confession of those things that are of faith is referred specifically as
    to its end, to that which concerns faith, according to 2 Cor. 4:13: "Having
    the same spirit of faith... we believe, and therefore we speak also." For
    the outward utterance is intended to signify the inward thought. Wherefore,
    just as the inward thought of matters of faith is properly an act of faith,
    so too is the outward confession of them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A threefold confession is commended by
    the Scriptures. One is the confession of matters of faith, and this is a
    proper act of faith, since it is referred to the end of faith as stated
    above. Another is the confession of thanksgiving or praise, and this is an
    act of "latria," for its purpose is to give outward honor to God, which is
    the end of "latria." The third is the confession of sins, which is ordained
    to the blotting out of sins, which is the end of penance, to which virtue it
    therefore belongs.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That which removes an obstacle is not a
    direct, but an indirect, cause, as the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii, 4).
    Hence fortitude which removes an obstacle to the confession of faith, viz.
    fear or shame, is not the proper and direct cause of confession, but an
    indirect cause so to speak.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Inward faith, with the aid of charity,
    causes all outward acts of virtue, by means of the other virtues,
    commanding, but not eliciting them; whereas it produces the act of
    confession as its proper act, without the help of any other virtue.<br />

    Whether confession of faith is necessary for salvation?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that confession of faith is not
    necessary for salvation. For, seemingly, a thing is sufficient for
    salvation, if it is a means of attaining the end of virtue. Now the proper
    end of faith is the union of the human mind with Divine truth, and this can
    be realized without any outward confession. Therefore confession of faith is
    not necessary for salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by outward confession of faith, a man
    reveals his faith to another man. But this is unnecessary save for those who
    have to instruct others in the faith. Therefore it seems that the simple
    folk are not bound to confess the faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever may tend to scandalize and
    disturb others, is not necessary for salvation, for the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++10%3A32"
      >1 Cor. 10:32</a
    >): "Be without offense to the Jews and to the gentiles and to the Church of
    God." Now confession of faith sometimes causes a disturbance among
    unbelievers. Therefore it is not necessary for salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++10%3A10"
      >Rm. 10:10</a
    >): "With the heart we believe unto justice; but with the mouth, confession
    is made unto salvation."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Things that are necessary for salvation come
    under the precepts of the Divine law. Now since confession of faith is
    something affirmative, it can only fall under an affirmative precept. Hence
    its necessity for salvation depends on how it falls under an affirmative
    precept of the Divine law. Now affirmative precepts as stated above (FS,
    Question [71], Article [5], ad 3; FS, Question [88], Article [1], ad 2) do
    not bind for always, although they are always binding; but they bind as to
    place and time according to other due circumstances, in respect of which
    human acts have to be regulated in order to be acts of virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus then it is not necessary for salvation to confess one's faith at all
    times and in all places, but in certain places and at certain times, when,
    namely, by omitting to do so, we would deprive God of due honor, or our
    neighbor of a service that we ought to render him: for instance, if a man,
    on being asked about his faith, were to remain silent, so as to make people
    believe either that he is without faith, or that the faith is false, or so
    as to turn others away from the faith; for in such cases as these,
    confession of faith is necessary for salvation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The end of faith, even as of the other
    virtues, must be referred to the end of charity, which is the love of God
    and our neighbor. Consequently when God's honor and our neighbor's good
    demand, man should not be contented with being united by faith to God's
    truth, but ought to confess his faith outwardly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In cases of necessity where faith is in
    danger, every one is bound to proclaim his faith to others, either to give
    good example and encouragement to the rest of the faithful, or to check the
    attacks of unbelievers: but at other times it is not the duty of all the
    faithful to instruct others in the faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There is nothing commendable in making a
    public confession of one's faith, if it causes a disturbance among
    unbelievers, without any profit either to the faith or to the faithful.
    Hence Our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++7%3A6"
      >Mt. 7:6</a
    >): "Give not that which is holy to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before
    swine... lest turning upon you, they tear you." Yet, if there is hope of
    profit to the faith, or if there be urgency, a man should disregard the
    disturbance of unbelievers, and confess his faith in public. Hence it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++15%3A12"
      >Mt. 15:12</a
    >) that when the disciples had said to Our Lord that "the Pharisee, when
    they heard this word, were scandalized," He answered: "Let them alone, they
    are blind, and leaders of the blind."<br />
