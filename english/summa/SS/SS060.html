  <h3 align="center">OF JUDGMENT (SIX ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    In due sequence we must consider judgment, under which head there are six
    points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS060.html#SSQ60A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether judgment is an act of
    justice?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS060.html#SSQ60A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is lawful to judge?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS060.html#SSQ60A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether judgment should be based
    on suspicions?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS060.html#SSQ60A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether doubts should be
    interpreted favorably?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS060.html#SSQ60A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether judgment should always be
    given according to the written law?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS060.html#SSQ60A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether judgment is perverted by
    being usurped?

  <h3 align="left">Whether judgment is an act of justice?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that judgment is not an act of
    justice. The Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 3) that "everyone judges well of
    what he knows," so that judgment would seem to belong to the cognitive
    faculty. Now the cognitive faculty is perfected by prudence. Therefore
    judgment belongs to prudence rather than to justice, which is in the will,
    as stated above (<a href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>,
    <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++2%3A15"
      >1 Cor. 2:15</a
    >): "The spiritual man judgeth all things." Now man is made spiritual
    chiefly by the virtue of charity, which "is poured forth in our hearts by
    the Holy Ghost Who is given to us" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A5"
      >Rm. 5:5</a
    >). Therefore judgment belongs to charity rather than to justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it belongs to every virtue to judge
    aright of its proper matter, because "the virtuous man is the rule and
    measure in everything," according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 4).
    Therefore judgment does not belong to justice any more than to the other
    moral virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, judgment would seem to belong only to
    judges. But the act of justice is to be found in every just man. Since then
    judges are not the only just men, it seems that judgment is not the proper
    act of justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++93%3A15"
      >Ps. 93:15</a
    >): "Until justice be turned into judgment."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Judgment properly denotes the act of a judge as
    such. Now a judge [judex] is so called because he asserts the right [jus
    dicens] and right is the object of justice, as stated above (<a
      href="SS057.html#SSQ57OUTP1"
      >Question [57]</a
    >, <a href="SS057.html#SSQ57A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Consequently the
    original meaning of the word "judgment" is a statement or decision of the
    just or right. Now to decide rightly about virtuous deeds proceeds, properly
    speaking, from the virtuous habit; thus a chaste person decides rightly
    about matters relating to chastity. Therefore judgment, which denotes a
    right decision about what is just, belongs properly to justice. For this
    reason the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 4) that "men have recourse to a judge
    as to one who is the personification of justice."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The word "judgment," from its original
    meaning of a right decision about what is just, has been extended to signify
    a right decision in any matter whether speculative or practical. Now a right
    judgment in any matter requires two things. The first is the virtue itself
    that pronounces judgment: and in this way, judgment is an act of reason,
    because it belongs to the reason to pronounce or define. The other is the
    disposition of the one who judges, on which depends his aptness for judging
    aright. In this way, in matters of justice, judgment proceeds from justice,
    even as in matters of fortitude, it proceeds from fortitude. Accordingly
    judgment is an act of justice in so far as justice inclines one to judge
    aright, and of prudence in so far as prudence pronounces judgment: wherefore
    {synesis} (judging well according to common law) which belongs to prudence
    is said to "judge rightly," as stated above (<a href="SS051.html#SSQ51OUTP1"
      >Question [51]</a
    >, <a href="SS051.html#SSQ51A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The spiritual man, by reason of the
    habit of charity, has an inclination to judge aright of all things according
    to the Divine rules; and it is in conformity with these that he pronounces
    judgment through the gift of wisdom: even as the just man pronounces
    judgment through the virtue of prudence conformably with the ruling of the
    law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The other virtues regulate man in
    himself, whereas justice regulates man in his dealings with others, as shown
    above (<a href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>,
    <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now man is master in
    things concerning himself, but not in matters relating to others.
    Consequently where the other virtues are in question, there is no need for
    judgment other than that of a virtuous man, taking judgment in its broader
    sense, as explained above (ad 1). But in matters of justice, there is
    further need for the judgment of a superior, who is "able to reprove both,
    and to put his hand between both" [*Job 9:33]. Hence judgment belongs more
    specifically to justice than to any other virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Justice is in the sovereign as a
    master-virtue [*Cf. Question [58], Article [6]], commanding and prescribing
    what is just; while it is in the subjects as an executive and administrative
    virtue. Hence judgment, which denotes a decision of what is just, belongs to
    justice, considered as existing chiefly in one who has authority.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether it is lawful to judge?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful to judge. For nothing is
    punished except what is unlawful. Now those who judge are threatened with
    punishment, which those who judge not will escape, according to Mt. 7:1,
    "Judge not, and ye shall not be judged." Therefore it is unlawful to
    judge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++14%3A4"
      >Rm. 14:4</a
    >): "Who art thou that judgest another man's servant. To his own lord he
    standeth or falleth." Now God is the Lord of all. Therefore to no man is it
    lawful to judge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no man is sinless, according to 1 Jn.
    1:8, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves." Now it is
    unlawful for a sinner to judge, according to Rm. 2:1, "Thou art inexcusable,
    O man, whosoever thou art, that judgest; for wherein thou judgest another,
    thou condemnest thyself, for thou dost the same things which thou judgest."
    Therefore to no man is it lawful to judge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++16%3A18"
      >Dt. 16:18</a
    >): "Thou shalt appoint judges and magistrates in all thy gates... that they
    may judge the people with just judgment."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Judgment is lawful in so far as it is an act of
    justice. Now it follows from what has been stated above (<a
      href="SS060.html#SSQ60A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 1,3) that three conditions are requisite for a judgment to be an act
    of justice: first, that it proceed from the inclination of justice;
    secondly, that it come from one who is in authority; thirdly, that it be
    pronounced according to the right ruling of prudence. If any one of these be
    lacking, the judgment will be faulty and unlawful. First, when it is
    contrary to the rectitude of justice, and then it is called "perverted" or
    "unjust": secondly, when a man judges about matters wherein he has no
    authority, and this is called judgment "by usurpation": thirdly, when the
    reason lacks certainty, as when a man, without any solid motive, forms a
    judgment on some doubtful or hidden matter, and then it is called judgment
    by "suspicion" or "rash" judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In these words our Lord forbids rash
    judgment which is about the inward intention, or other uncertain things, as
    Augustine states (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 18). Or else He forbids
    judgment about Divine things, which we ought not to judge, but simply
    believe, since they are above us, as Hilary declares in his commentary on
    Mt. 5. Or again according to Chrysostom [*Hom. xvii in Matth. in the Opus
    Imperfectum falsely ascribed to St. John of the Cross], He forbids the
    judgment which proceeds not from benevolence but from bitterness of
    heart.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A judge is appointed as God's servant;
    wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++1%3A16"
      >Dt. 1:16</a
    >): "Judge that which is just," and further on (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++1%3A17"
      >Dt. 1:17</a
    >), "because it is the judgment of God."
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who stand guilty of grievous sins
    should not judge those who are guilty of the same or lesser sins, as
    Chrysostom [*Hom. xxiv] says on the words of Mt. 7:1, "Judge not." Above all
    does this hold when such sins are public, because there would be an occasion
    of scandal arising in the hearts of others. If however they are not public
    but hidden, and there be an urgent necessity for the judge to pronounce
    judgment, because it is his duty, he can reprove or judge with humility and
    fear. Hence Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 19): "If we find that
    we are guilty of the same sin as another man, we should groan together with
    him, and invite him to strive against it together with us." And yet it is
    not through acting thus that a man condemns himself so as to deserve to be
    condemned once again, but when, in condemning another, he shows himself to
    be equally deserving of condemnation on account of another or a like sin.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether it is unlawful to form a judgment from suspicions?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not unlawful to form a
    judgment from suspicions. For suspicion is seemingly an uncertain opinion
    about an evil, wherefore the Philosopher states (Ethic. vi, 3) that
    suspicion is about both the true and the false. Now it is impossible to have
    any but an uncertain opinion about contingent singulars. Since then human
    judgment is about human acts, which are about singular and contingent
    matters, it seems that no judgment would be lawful, if it were not lawful to
    judge from suspicions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man does his neighbor an injury by
    judging him unlawfully. But an evil suspicion consists in nothing more than
    a man's opinion, and consequently does not seem to pertain to the injury of
    another man. Therefore judgment based on suspicion is not unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if it is unlawful, it must needs be
    reducible to an injustice, since judgment is an act of justice, as stated
    above (<a href="SS060.html#SSQ60A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now an injustice
    is always a mortal sin according to its genus, as stated above (<a
      href="SS059.html#SSQ59OUTP1"
      >Question [59]</a
    >, <a href="SS059.html#SSQ59A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore a judgment
    based on suspicion would always be a mortal sin, if it were unlawful. But
    this is false, because "we cannot avoid suspicions," according to a gloss of
    Augustine (Tract. xc in Joan.) on 1 Cor. 4:5, "Judge not before the time."
    Therefore a judgment based on suspicion would seem not to be unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Chrysostom [*Hom. xvii in Matth. in the Opus
    Imperfectum falsely ascribed to St. John of the Cross] in comment on the
    words of Mt. 7:1, "Judge not," etc., says: "By this commandment our Lord
    does not forbid Christians to reprove others from kindly motives, but that
    Christian should despise Christian by boasting his own righteousness, by
    hating and condemning others for the most part on mere suspicion."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii), suspicion
    denotes evil thinking based on slight indications, and this is due to three
    causes. First, from a man being evil in himself, and from this very fact, as
    though conscious of his own wickedness, he is prone to think evil of others,
    according to Eccles. 10:3, "The fool when he walketh in the way, whereas he
    himself is a fool, esteemeth all men fools." Secondly, this is due to a man
    being ill-disposed towards another: for when a man hates or despises
    another, or is angry with or envious of him, he is led by slight indications
    to think evil of him, because everyone easily believes what he desires.
    Thirdly, this is due to long experience: wherefore the Philosopher says
    (Rhet. ii, 13) that "old people are very suspicious, for they have often
    experienced the faults of others." The first two causes of suspicion
    evidently connote perversity of the affections, while the third diminishes
    the nature of suspicion, in as much as experience leads to certainty which
    is contrary to the nature of suspicion. Consequently suspicion denotes a
    certain amount of vice, and the further it goes, the more vicious it is.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now there are three degrees of suspicion. The first degree is when a man
    begins to doubt of another's goodness from slight indications. This is a
    venial and a light sin; for "it belongs to human temptation without which no
    man can go through this life," according to a gloss on 1 Cor. 4:5, "Judge
    not before the time." The second degree is when a man, from slight
    indications, esteems another man's wickedness as certain. This is a mortal
    sin, if it be about a grave matter, since it cannot be without contempt of
    one's neighbor. Hence the same gloss goes on to say: "If then we cannot
    avoid suspicions, because we are human, we must nevertheless restrain our
    judgment, and refrain from forming a definite and fixed opinion." The third
    degree is when a judge goes so far as to condemn a man on suspicion: this
    pertains directly to injustice, and consequently is a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some kind of certainty is found in human
    acts, not indeed the certainty of a demonstration, but such as is befitting
    the matter in point, for instance when a thing is proved by suitable
    witnesses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> From the very fact that a man thinks
    evil of another without sufficient cause, he despises him unduly, and
    therefore does him an injury.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since justice and injustice are about
    external operations, as stated above (<a href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1"
      >Question [58]</a
    >, <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58ATHEP1">Articles [8]</a>,10,11;
    <a href="SS059.html#SSQ59OUTP1">Question [59]</a>,
    <a href="SS059.html#SSQ59A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3), the judgment of
    suspicion pertains directly to injustice when it is betrayed by external
    action, and then it is a mortal sin, as stated above. The internal judgment
    pertains to justice, in so far as it is related to the external judgment,
    even as the internal to the external act, for instance as desire is related
    to fornication, or anger to murder.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether doubts should be interpreted for the best?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that doubts should not be
    interpreted for the best. Because we should judge from what happens for the
    most part. But it happens for the most part that evil is done, since "the
    number of fools is infinite" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++1%3A15"
      >Eccles. 1:15</a
    >), "for the imagination and thought of man's heart are prone to evil from
    his youth" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++8%3A21"
      >Gn. 8:21</a
    >). Therefore doubts should be interpreted for the worst rather than for the
    best.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 27)
    that "he leads a godly and just life who is sound in his estimate of things,
    and turns neither to this side nor to that." Now he who interprets a
    doubtful point for the best, turns to one side. Therefore this should not be
    done.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man should love his neighbor as himself.
    Now with regard to himself, a man should interpret doubtful matters for the
    worst, according to Job 9:28, "I feared all my works." Therefore it seems
    that doubtful matters affecting one's neighbor should be interpreted for the
    worst.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Rm. 14:3, "He that eateth not, let
    him not judge him that eateth," says: "Doubts should be interpreted in the
    best sense."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS060.html#SSQ60A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >, ad 2), things from the very fact that a man thinks ill of another without
    sufficient cause, he injures and despises him. Now no man ought to despise
    or in any way injure another man without urgent cause: and, consequently,
    unless we have evident indications of a person's wickedness, we ought to
    deem him good, by interpreting for the best whatever is doubtful about
    him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> He who interprets doubtful matters for
    the best, may happen to be deceived more often than not; yet it is better to
    err frequently through thinking well of a wicked man, than to err less
    frequently through having an evil opinion of a good man, because in the
    latter case an injury is inflicted, but not in the former.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is one thing to judge of things and
    another to judge of men. For when we judge of things, there is no question
    of the good or evil of the thing about which we are judging, since it will
    take no harm no matter what kind of judgment we form about it; but there is
    question of the good of the person who judges, if he judge truly, and of his
    evil if he judge falsely because "the true is the good of the intellect, and
    the false is its evil," as stated in Ethic. vi, 2, wherefore everyone should
    strive to make his judgment accord with things as they are. On the other
    hand when we judge of men, the good and evil in our judgment is considered
    chiefly on the part of the person about whom judgment is being formed; for
    he is deemed worthy of honor from the very fact that he is judged to be
    good, and deserving of contempt if he is judged to be evil. For this reason
    we ought, in this kind of judgment, to aim at judging a man good, unless
    there is evident proof of the contrary. And though we may judge falsely, our
    judgment in thinking well of another pertains to our good feeling and not to
    the evil of the intellect, even as neither does it pertain to the
    intellect's perfection to know the truth of contingent singulars in
    themselves.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> One may interpret something for the
    worst or for the best in two ways. First, by a kind of supposition; and
    thus, when we have to apply a remedy to some evil, whether our own or
    another's, in order for the remedy to be applied with greater certainty of a
    cure, it is expedient to take the worst for granted, since if a remedy be
    efficacious against a worse evil, much more is it efficacious against a
    lesser evil. Secondly we may interpret something for the best or for the
    worst, by deciding or determining, and in this case when judging of things
    we should try to interpret each thing according as it is, and when judging
    of persons, to interpret things for the best as stated above.<br />

    Whether we should always judge according to the written law?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought not always to judge
    according to the written law. For we ought always to avoid judging unjustly.
    But written laws sometimes contain injustice, according to Is. 10:1, "Woe to
    them that make wicked laws, and when they write, write injustice." Therefore
    we ought not always to judge according to the written law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, judgment has to be formed about
    individual happenings. But no written law can cover each and every
    individual happening, as the Philosopher declares (Ethic. v, 10). Therefore
    it seems that we are not always bound to judge according to the written
    law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a law is written in order that the
    lawgiver's intention may be made clear. But it happens sometimes that even
    if the lawgiver himself were present he would judge otherwise. Therefore we
    ought not always to judge according to the written law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xxxi): "In
    these earthly laws, though men judge about them when they are making them,
    when once they are established and passed, the judges may judge no longer of
    them, but according to them."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS060.html#SSQ60A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), judgment is nothing else but a decision or determination of what is
    just. Now a thing becomes just in two ways: first by the very nature of the
    case, and this is called "natural right," secondly by some agreement between
    men, and this is called "positive right," as stated above (<a
      href="SS057.html#SSQ57OUTP1"
      >Question [57]</a
    >, <a href="SS057.html#SSQ57A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now laws are written
    for the purpose of manifesting both these rights, but in different ways. For
    the written law does indeed contain natural right, but it does not establish
    it, for the latter derives its force, not from the law but from nature:
    whereas the written law both contains positive right, and establishes it by
    giving it force of authority.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence it is necessary to judge according to the written law, else judgment
    would fall short either of the natural or of the positive right.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as the written law does not give
    force to the natural right, so neither can it diminish or annul its force,
    because neither can man's will change nature. Hence if the written law
    contains anything contrary to the natural right, it is unjust and has no
    binding force. For positive right has no place except where "it matters
    not," according to the natural right, "whether a thing be done in one way or
    in another"; as stated above (<a href="SS057.html#SSQ57OUTP1"
      >Question [57]</a
    >, <a href="SS057.html#SSQ57A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). Wherefore such
    documents are to be called, not laws, but rather corruptions of law, as
    stated above (FS, Question [95], Article [2]): and consequently judgment
    should not be delivered according to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even as unjust laws by their very nature
    are, either always or for the most part, contrary to the natural right, so
    too laws that are rightly established, fail in some cases, when if they were
    observed they would be contrary to the natural right. Wherefore in such
    cases judgment should be delivered, not according to the letter of the law,
    but according to equity which the lawgiver has in view. Hence the jurist
    says [*Digest. i, 3; De leg. senatusque consult. 25]: "By no reason of law,
    or favor of equity, is it allowable for us to interpret harshly, and render
    burdensome, those useful measures which have been enacted for the welfare of
    man." In such cases even the lawgiver himself would decide otherwise; and if
    he had foreseen the case, he might have provided for it by law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the Third Objection.</p>

    Whether judgment is rendered perverse by being usurped?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that judgment is not rendered
    perverse by being usurped. For justice is rectitude in matters of action.
    Now truth is not impaired, no matter who tells it, but it may suffer from
    the person who ought to accept it. Therefore again justice loses nothing, no
    matter who declares what is just, and this is what is meant by judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to judgment to punish sins.
    Now it is related to the praise of some that they punished sins without
    having authority over those whom they punished; such as Moses in slaying the
    Egyptian (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++2%3A12"
      >Ex. 2:12</a
    >), and Phinees the son of Eleazar in slaying Zambri the son of Salu (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Num++25%3A7-14"
      >Num. 25:7-14</a
    >), and "it was reputed to him unto justice" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++105%3A31"
      >Ps. 105:31</a
    >). Therefore usurpation of judgment pertains not to injustice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, spiritual power is distinct from
    temporal. Now prelates having spiritual power sometimes interfere in matters
    concerning the secular power. Therefore usurped judgment is not unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, even as the judge requires authority in
    order to judge aright, so also does he need justice and knowledge, as shown
    above (<a href="SS060.html#SSQ60A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1,3;
    <a href="SS060.html#SSQ60A1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But a judgment is not
    described as unjust, if he who judges lacks the habit of justice or the
    knowledge of the law. Neither therefore is it always unjust to judge by
    usurpation, i.e. without authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++14%3A4"
      >Rm. 14:4</a
    >): "Who art thou that judgest another man's servant?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since judgment should be pronounced according
    to the written law, as stated above (<a href="SS060.html#SSQ60A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >), he that pronounces judgment, interprets, in a way, the letter of the
    law, by applying it to some particular case. Now since it belongs to the
    same authority to interpret and to make a law, just as a law cannot be made
    save by public authority, so neither can a judgment be pronounced except by
    public authority, which extends over those who are subject to the community.
    Wherefore even as it would be unjust for one man to force another to observe
    a law that was not approved by public authority, so too it is unjust, if a
    man compels another to submit to a judgment that is pronounced by other than
    the public authority.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When the truth is declared there is no
    obligation to accept it, and each one is free to receive it or not, as he
    wishes. On the other hand judgment implies an obligation, wherefore it is
    unjust for anyone to be judged by one who has no public authority.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Moses seems to have slain the Egyptian
    by authority received as it were, by divine inspiration; this seems to
    follow from Acts 7:24, 25, where it is said that "striking the Egyptian...
    he thought that his brethren understood that God by his hand would save
    Israel [Vulg.: 'them']." Or it may be replied that Moses slew the Egyptian
    in order to defend the man who was unjustly attacked, without himself
    exceeding the limits of a blameless defence. Wherefore Ambrose says (De
    Offic. i, 36) that "whoever does not ward off a blow from a fellow man when
    he can, is as much in fault as the striker"; and he quotes the example of
    Moses. Again we may reply with Augustine (Questions. Exod. qu. 2) [*Cf.
    Contra Faust. xxii, 70] that just as "the soil gives proof of its fertility
    by producing useless herbs before the useful seeds have grown, so this deed
    of Moses was sinful although it gave a sign of great fertility," in so far,
    to wit, as it was a sign of the power whereby he was to deliver his
    people.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    With regard to Phinees the reply is that he did this out of zeal for God by
    Divine inspiration; or because though not as yet high-priest, he was
    nevertheless the high-priest's son, and this judgment was his concern as of
    the other judges, to whom this was commanded [*Ex. 22:20; Lev. 20; Dt.
    13,17].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The secular power is subject to the
    spiritual, even as the body is subject to the soul. Consequently the
    judgment is not usurped if the spiritual authority interferes in those
    temporal matters that are subject to the spiritual authority or which have
    been committed to the spiritual by the temporal authority.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The habits of knowledge and justice are
    perfections of the individual, and consequently their absence does not make
    a judgment to be usurped, as in the absence of public authority which gives
    a judgment its coercive force.<br />
