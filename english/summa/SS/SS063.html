    VICES OPPOSED TO DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE (Question [63])<br />
    <br />
    OF RESPECT OF PERSONS (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the vices opposed to the aforesaid parts of justice.
    First we shall consider respect of persons which is opposed to distributive
    justice; secondly we shall consider the vices opposed to commutative
    justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS063.html#SSQ63A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether respect of persons is a
    sin?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS063.html#SSQ63A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it takes place in the
    dispensation of spiritualities?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS063.html#SSQ63A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it takes place in showing
    honor?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS063.html#SSQ63A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it takes place in judicial
    sentences?

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether respect of persons is a sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that respect of persons is not a
    sin. For the word "person" includes a reference to personal dignity [*Cf.
    FP, Question [29], Article [3], ad 2]. Now it belongs to distributive
    justice to consider personal dignity. Therefore respect of persons is not a
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in human affairs persons are of more
    importance than things, since things are for the benefit of persons and not
    conversely. But respect of things is not a sin. Much less, therefore, is
    respect of persons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no injustice or sin can be in God. Yet
    God seems to respect persons, since of two men circumstanced alike He
    sometimes upraises one by grace, and leaves the other in sin, according to
    Mt. 24:40: "Two shall be in a bed [Vulg.: 'field' [*'Bed' is the reading of
    Lk. 17:34]], one shall be taken, and one shall be left." Therefore respect
    of persons is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Nothing but sin is forbidden in the Divine
    law. Now respect of persons is forbidden, Dt. 1:17: "Neither shall you
    respect any man's person." Therefore respect of persons is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Respect of persons is opposed to distributive
    justice. For the equality of distributive justice consists in allotting
    various things to various persons in proportion to their personal dignity.
    Accordingly, if one considers that personal property by reason of which the
    thing allotted to a particular person is due to him, this is respect not of
    the person but of the cause. Hence a gloss on Eph. 6:9, "There is no respect
    of persons with God [Vulg.: 'Him']," says that "a just judge regards causes,
    not persons." For instance if you promote a man to a professorship on
    account of his having sufficient knowledge, you consider the due cause, not
    the person; but if, in conferring something on someone, you consider in him
    not the fact that what you give him is proportionate or due to him, but the
    fact that he is this particular man (e.g. Peter or Martin), then there is
    respect of the person, since you give him something not for some cause that
    renders him worthy of it, but simply because he is this person. And any
    circumstance that does not amount to a reason why this man be worthy of this
    gift, is to be referred to his person: for instance if a man promote someone
    to a prelacy or a professorship, because he is rich or because he is a
    relative of his, it is respect of persons. It may happen, however, that a
    circumstance of person makes a man worthy as regards one thing, but not as
    regards another: thus consanguinity makes a man worthy to be appointed heir
    to an estate, but not to be chosen for a position of ecclesiastical
    authority: wherefore consideration of the same circumstance of person will
    amount to respect of persons in one matter and not in another. It follows,
    accordingly, that respect of persons is opposed to distributive justice in
    that it fails to observe due proportion. Now nothing but sin is opposed to
    virtue: and therefore respect of persons is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In distributive justice we consider
    those circumstances of a person which result in dignity or right, whereas in
    respect of persons we consider circumstances that do not so result.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Persons are rendered proportionate to
    and worthy of things which are distributed among them, by reason of certain
    things pertaining to circumstances of person, wherefore such conditions
    ought to be considered as the proper cause. But when we consider the persons
    themselves, that which is not a cause is considered as though it were; and
    so it is clear that although persons are more worthy, absolutely speaking,
    yet they are not more worthy in this regard.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There is a twofold giving. one belongs
    to justice, and occurs when we give a man his due: in such like givings
    respect of persons takes place. The other giving belongs to liberality, when
    one gives gratis that which is not a man's due: such is the bestowal of the
    gifts of grace, whereby sinners are chosen by God. In such a giving there is
    no place for respect of persons, because anyone may, without injustice, give
    of his own as much as he will, and to whom he will, according to Mt.
    20:14,15, "Is it not lawful for me to do what I will?... Take what is thine,
    and go thy way."<br />

    Whether respect of persons takes place in the dispensation of spiritual
    goods?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that respect of persons does not
    take place in the dispensation of spiritual goods. For it would seem to
    savor of respect of persons if a man confers ecclesiastical dignity or
    benefice on account of consanguinity, since consanguinity is not a cause
    whereby a man is rendered worthy of an ecclesiastical benefice. Yet this
    apparently is not a sin, for ecclesiastical prelates are wont to do so.
    Therefore the sin of respect of persons does not take place in the
    conferring of spiritual goods.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to give preference to a rich man rather
    than to a poor man seems to pertain to respect of persons, according to
    James 2:2,3. Nevertheless dispensations to marry within forbidden degrees
    are more readily granted to the rich and powerful than to others. Therefore
    the sin of respect of persons seems not to take place in the dispensation of
    spiritual goods.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to jurists [*Cap. Cum
    dilectus.] it suffices to choose a good man, and it is not requisite that
    one choose the better man. But it would seem to savor of respect of persons
    to choose one who is less good for a higher position. Therefore respect of
    persons is not a sin in spiritual matters.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, according to the law of the Church (Cap.
    Cum dilectus.) the person to be chosen should be "a member of the flock."
    Now this would seem to imply respect of persons, since sometimes more
    competent persons would be found elsewhere. Therefore respect of persons is
    not a sin in spiritual matters.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+2%3A1"
      >James 2:1</a
    >): "Have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ... with respect of
    persons." On these words a gloss of Augustine says: "Who is there that would
    tolerate the promotion of a rich man to a position of honor in the Church,
    to the exclusion of a poor man more learned and holier?" [*Augustine, Ep. ad
    Hieron. clxvii.]<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS063.html#SSQ63A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), respect of persons is a sin, in so far as it is contrary to justice. Now
    the graver the matter in which justice is transgressed, the more grievous
    the sin: so that, spiritual things being of greater import than temporal,
    respect of persons is a more grievous sin in dispensing spiritualities than
    in dispensing temporalities. And since it is respect of persons when
    something is allotted to a person out of proportion to his deserts, it must
    be observed that a person's worthiness may be considered in two ways. First,
    simply and absolutely: and in this way the man who abounds the more in the
    spiritual gifts of grace is the more worthy. Secondly, in relation to the
    common good; for it happens at times that the less holy and less learned man
    may conduce more to the common good, on account of worldly authority or
    activity, or something of the kind. And since the dispensation of
    spiritualities is directed chiefly to the common good, according to 1 Cor.
    12:7, "The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit,"
    it follows that in the dispensation of spiritualities the simply less good
    are sometimes preferred to the better, without respect of persons, just as
    God sometimes bestows gratuitous graces on the less worthy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We must make a distinction with regard
    to a prelate's kinsfolk: for sometimes they are less worthy, both absolutely
    speaking, and in relation to the common good: and then if they are preferred
    to the more worthy, there is a sin of respect of persons in the dispensation
    of spiritual goods, whereof the ecclesiastical superior is not the owner,
    with power to give them away as he will, but the dispenser, according to 1
    Cor. 4:1, "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ, and the
    dispensers of the mysteries of God." Sometimes however the prelate's
    kinsfolk are as worthy as others, and then without respect of persons he can
    lawfully give preference to his kindred since there is at least this
    advantage, that he can trust the more in their being of one mind with him in
    conducting the business of the Church. Yet he would have to forego so doing
    for fear of scandal, if anyone might take an example from him and give the
    goods of the Church to their kindred without regard to their deserts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Dispensations for contracting marriage
    came into use for the purpose of strengthening treaties of peace: and this
    is more necessary for the common good in relation to persons of standing, so
    that there is no respect of persons in granting dispensations more readily
    to such persons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In order that an election be not
    rebutted in a court of law, it suffices to elect a good man, nor is it
    necessary to elect the better man, because otherwise every election might
    have a flaw. But as regards the conscience of an elector, it is necessary to
    elect one who is better, either absolutely speaking, or in relation to the
    common good. For if it is possible to have one who is more competent for a
    post, and yet another be preferred, it is necessary to have some cause for
    this. If this cause have anything to do with the matter in point, he who is
    elected will, in this respect, be more competent; and if that which is taken
    for cause have nothing to do with the matter, it will clearly be respect of
    persons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The man who is taken from among the
    members of a particular Church, is generally speaking more useful as regards
    the common good, since he loves more the Church wherein he was brought up.
    For this reason it was commanded (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++17%3A15"
      >Dt. 17:15</a
    >): "Thou mayest not make a man of another nation king, who is not thy
    brother."<br />

    Whether respect of persons takes place in showing honor and respect?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that respect of persons does not
    take place in showing honor and respect. For honor is apparently nothing
    else than "reverence shown to a person in recognition of his virtue," as the
    Philosopher states (Ethic. i, 5). Now prelates and princes should be honored
    although they be wicked, even as our parents, of whom it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++20%3A12"
      >Ex. 20:12</a
    >): "Honor thy father and thy mother." Again masters, though they be wicked,
    should be honored by their servants, according to 1 Tim. 6:1: "Whoever are
    servants under the yoke, let them count their masters worthy of all honor."
    Therefore it seems that it is not a sin to respect persons in showing
    honor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is commanded (Lev. 19:32): "Rise up
    before the hoary head, and, honor the person of the aged man." But this
    seems to savor of respect of persons, since sometimes old men are not
    virtuous; according to Dan. 13:5: "Iniquity came out from the ancients of
    the people [*Vulg.: 'Iniquity came out of Babylon from the ancient judges,
    that seemed to govern the people.']." Therefore it is not a sin to respect
    persons in showing honor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, on the words of James 2:1, "Have not the
    faith... with respect of persons," a gloss of Augustine [*Ep. ad Hieron.
    clxvii.] says: "If the saying of James, 'If there shall come into your
    assembly a man having a golden ring,' etc., refer to our daily meetings, who
    sins not here, if however he sin at all?" Yet it is respect of persons to
    honor the rich for their riches, for Gregory says in a homily (xxviii in
    Evang.): "Our pride is blunted, since in men we honor, not the nature
    wherein they are made to God's image, but wealth," so that, wealth not being
    a due cause of honor, this will savor of respect of persons. Therefore it is
    not a sin to respect persons in showing honor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on James 2:1, says: "Whoever honors
    the rich for their riches, sins," and in like manner, if a man be honored
    for other causes that do not render him worthy of honor. Now this savors of
    respect of persons. Therefore it is a sin to respect persons in showing
    honor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> To honor a person is to recognize him as having
    virtue, wherefore virtue alone is the due cause of a person being honored.
    Now it is to be observed that a person may be honored not only for his own
    virtue, but also for another's: thus princes and prelates, although they be
    wicked, are honored as standing in God's place, and as representing the
    community over which they are placed, according to Prov. 26:8, "As he that
    casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury, so is he that giveth honor to a
    fool." For, since the gentiles ascribed the keeping of accounts to Mercury,
    "the heap of Mercury" signifies the casting up of an account, when a
    merchant sometimes substitutes a pebble [*'Lapillus' or 'calculus' whence
    the English word 'calculate'] for one hundred marks. So too, is a fool
    honored if he stand in God's place or represent the whole community: and in
    the same way parents and masters should be honored, on account of their
    having a share of the dignity of God Who is the Father and Lord of all. The
    aged should be honored, because old age is a sign of virtue, though this
    sign fail at times: wherefore, according to Wis. 4:8,9, "venerable old age
    is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years; but the
    understanding of a man is gray hairs, and a spotless life is old age." The
    rich ought to be honored by reason of their occupying a higher position in
    the community: but if they be honored merely for their wealth, it will be
    the sin of respect of persons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Hence the Replies to the Objections are clear.</p>

    Whether the sin of respect of persons takes place in judicial sentences?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the sin of respect of persons
    does not take place in judicial sentences. For respect of persons is opposed
    to distributive justice, as stated above (<a href="SS063.html#SSQ63A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >): whereas judicial sentences seem to pertain chiefly to commutative
    justice. Therefore respect of persons does not take place in judicial
    sentences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, penalties are inflicted according to a
    sentence. Now it is not a sin to respect persons in pronouncing penalties,
    since a heavier punishment is inflicted on one who injures the person of a
    prince than on one who injures the person of others. Therefore respect of
    persons does not take place in judicial sentences.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (Ecclus. 4:10): "In
    judging be merciful to the fatherless." But this seems to imply respect of
    the person of the needy. Therefore in judicial sentences respect of persons
    is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++18%3A5"
      >Prov. 18:5</a
    >): "It is not good to accept the person in judgment [*Vulg.: 'It is not
    good to accept the person of the wicked, to decline from the truth of
    judgment.']."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS060.html#SSQ60OUTP1"
      >Question [60]</a
    >, <a href="SS060.html#SSQ60A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), judgment is an act of
    justice, in as much as the judge restores to the equality of justice, those
    things which may cause an opposite inequality. Now respect of persons
    involves a certain inequality, in so far as something is allotted to a
    person out of that proportion to him in which the equality of justice
    consists. Wherefore it is evident that judgment is rendered corrupt by
    respect of persons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A judgment may be looked at in two ways.
    First, in view of the thing judged, and in this way judgment is common to
    commutative and distributive justice: because it may be decided by judgment
    how some common good is to be distributed among many, and how one person is
    to restore to another what he has taken from him. Secondly, it may be
    considered in view of the form of judgment, in as much as, even in
    commutative justice, the judge takes from one and gives to another, and this
    belongs to distributive justice. In this way respect of persons may take
    place in any judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When a person is more severely punished
    on account of a crime committed against a greater person, there is no
    respect of persons, because the very difference of persons causes, in that
