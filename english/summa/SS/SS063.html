<br>
OF RESPECT OF PERSONS (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the vices opposed to the aforesaid parts of 
justice. First we shall consider respect of persons which is opposed to 
distributive justice; secondly we shall consider the  vices opposed to 
commutative justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS063.html#SSQ63A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether respect of persons is a sin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS063.html#SSQ63A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it takes place in the dispensation of spiritualities?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS063.html#SSQ63A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it takes place in showing honor?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS063.html#SSQ63A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it takes place in judicial sentences?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that respect of persons is not a sin. For the word 
"person" includes a reference to personal dignity [*Cf. FP, Question [29], Article [3], 
ad 2]. Now it belongs to distributive justice to consider personal 
dignity. Therefore respect of persons is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in human affairs persons are of more importance than 
things, since things are for the benefit of persons and not conversely. 
But respect of things is not a sin. Much less, therefore, is respect of 
persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no injustice or sin can be in God. Yet God seems to 
respect persons, since of two men circumstanced alike He sometimes 
upraises one by grace, and leaves the other in sin, according to Mt. 
24:40: "Two shall be in a bed [Vulg.: 'field' [*'Bed' is the reading of 
Lk. 17:34]], one shall be taken, and one shall be left." Therefore 
respect of persons is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Nothing but sin is forbidden in the Divine law. Now 
respect of persons is forbidden, Dt. 1:17: "Neither shall you respect any 
man's person." Therefore respect of persons is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Respect of persons is opposed to distributive justice. 
For the equality of distributive justice consists in allotting various 
things to various persons in proportion to their personal dignity. 
Accordingly, if one considers that personal property by reason of which 
the thing allotted to a particular person is due to him, this is respect 
not of the person but of the cause. Hence a gloss on Eph. 6:9, "There is 
no respect of persons with God [Vulg.: 'Him']," says that "a just judge 
regards causes, not persons." For instance if you promote a man to a 
professorship on account of his having sufficient knowledge, you consider 
the due cause, not the person; but if, in conferring something on 
someone, you consider in him not the fact that what you give him is 
proportionate or due to him, but the fact that he is this particular man 
(e.g. Peter or Martin), then there is respect of the person, since you 
give him something not for some cause that renders him worthy of it, but 
simply because he is this person. And any circumstance that does not 
amount to a reason why this man be worthy of this gift, is to be referred 
to his person: for instance if a man promote someone to a prelacy or a 
professorship, because  he is rich or because he is a relative of his, it 
is respect of persons. It may happen, however, that a circumstance of 
person makes a man worthy as regards one thing, but not as regards 
another: thus consanguinity makes a man worthy to be appointed heir to an 
estate, but not to be chosen for a position of ecclesiastical authority: 
wherefore consideration of the same circumstance of person will amount to 
respect of persons in one matter and not in another. It follows, 
accordingly, that respect of persons is opposed to distributive justice 
in that it fails to observe due proportion. Now nothing but sin is 
opposed to virtue: and therefore respect of persons is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In distributive justice we consider those circumstances of 
a person which result in dignity or right, whereas in respect of persons 
we consider circumstances that do not so result.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Persons are rendered proportionate to and worthy of things 
which are distributed among them, by reason of certain things pertaining 
to circumstances of person, wherefore such conditions ought to be 
considered as the proper cause. But when we consider the persons 
themselves, that which is not a cause is considered as though it were; 
and so it is clear that although persons are more worthy, absolutely 
speaking, yet they are not more worthy in this regard.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There is a twofold giving. one belongs to justice, and 
occurs when we give a man his due: in such like givings respect of 
persons takes place. The other giving belongs to liberality, when one 
gives gratis that which is not a man's due: such is the bestowal of the 
gifts of grace, whereby sinners are chosen by God. In such a giving there 
is no place for respect of persons, because anyone may, without 
injustice, give of his own as much as he will, and to whom he will, 
according to Mt. 20:14,15, "Is it not lawful for me to do what I will? . 
. . Take what is thine, and go thy way."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether respect of persons takes place in the dispensation of spiritual goods?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that respect of persons does not take place in the 
dispensation of spiritual goods. For it would seem to savor of respect of 
persons if a man confers ecclesiastical dignity or benefice on account of 
consanguinity, since consanguinity is not a cause whereby a man is 
rendered worthy of an ecclesiastical benefice. Yet this apparently is not 
a sin, for ecclesiastical prelates are wont to do so. Therefore the sin 
of respect of persons does not take place in the conferring of spiritual 
goods.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to give preference to a rich man rather than to a poor 
man seems to pertain to respect of persons, according to James 2:2,3. 
Nevertheless dispensations to marry within forbidden degrees are more 
readily granted to the rich and powerful than to  others. Therefore the 
sin of respect of persons seems not to take place in the dispensation of 
spiritual goods.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to jurists [*Cap. Cum dilectus.] it suffices 
to choose a good man, and it is not requisite that one choose the better 
man. But it would seem to savor of respect of persons to choose one who 
is less good for a higher position. Therefore respect of persons is not a 
sin in spiritual matters.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, according to the law of the Church (Cap. Cum dilectus.) 
the person to be chosen should be "a member of the flock." Now this would 
seem to imply respect of persons, since sometimes more competent persons 
would be found elsewhere. Therefore respect of persons is not a sin in 
spiritual matters.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+2%3A1">James 2:1</a>): "Have not the faith of our 
Lord Jesus Christ . . . with respect of persons." On these words a gloss 
of Augustine says: "Who is there that would tolerate the promotion of a 
rich man to a position of honor in the Church, to the exclusion of a poor 
man more learned and holier?" [*Augustine, Ep. ad Hieron. clxvii.]<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS063.html#SSQ63A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), respect of persons is a sin, in 
so far as it is contrary to justice. Now the graver the matter in which 
justice is transgressed, the more grievous the sin: so that, spiritual 
things being of greater import than temporal, respect of persons is a 
more grievous sin in dispensing spiritualities than in dispensing 
temporalities. And since it is respect of persons when something is 
allotted to a person out of proportion to his deserts, it must be 
observed that a person's worthiness may be considered in two ways. First, 
simply and absolutely: and in this way the man who abounds the more in 
the spiritual gifts of grace is the more worthy. Secondly, in relation to 
the common good; for it happens at times that the less holy and less 
learned man may conduce more to the common good, on account of worldly 
authority or activity, or something of the kind. And since the 
dispensation of spiritualities is directed chiefly to the common good, 
according to 1 Cor. 12:7, "The manifestation of the Spirit is given to 
every man unto profit," it follows that in the dispensation of 
spiritualities the simply less good are sometimes preferred to the 
better, without respect of persons, just as God sometimes bestows 
gratuitous graces on the less worthy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We must make a distinction with regard to a prelate's 
kinsfolk: for sometimes they are less worthy, both absolutely speaking, 
and in relation to the common good: and then if they are preferred to the 
more worthy, there is a sin of respect of persons in the dispensation of 
spiritual goods, whereof the ecclesiastical superior is not the owner, 
with power to give them away as he will, but the dispenser, according to 
1 Cor. 4:1, "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ, 
and the dispensers of the mysteries of God." Sometimes however the 
prelate's kinsfolk are as worthy as others, and then without respect of 
persons he can lawfully give preference to his kindred  since there is at 
least this advantage, that he can trust the more in their being of one 
mind with him in conducting the business of the Church. Yet he would have 
to forego so doing for fear of scandal, if anyone might take an example 
from him and give the goods of the Church to their kindred without regard 
to their deserts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Dispensations for contracting marriage came into use for 
the purpose of strengthening treaties of peace: and this is more 
necessary for the common good in relation to persons of standing, so that 
there is no respect of persons in granting dispensations more readily to 
such persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In order that an election be not rebutted in a court of 
law, it suffices to elect a good man, nor is it necessary to elect the 
better man, because otherwise every election might have a flaw. But as 
regards the conscience of an elector, it is necessary to elect one who is 
better, either absolutely speaking, or in relation to the common good. 
For if it is possible to have one who is more competent for a post, and 
yet another be preferred, it is necessary to have some cause for this. If 
this cause have anything to do with the matter in point, he who is 
elected will, in this respect, be more competent; and if that which is 
taken for cause have nothing to do with the matter, it will clearly be 
respect of persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The man who is taken from among the members of a particular 
Church, is generally speaking more useful as regards the common good, 
since he loves more the Church wherein he was brought up. For this reason 
it was commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++17%3A15">Dt. 17:15</a>): "Thou mayest not make a man of another 
nation king, who is not thy brother."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that respect of persons does not take place in 
showing honor and respect. For honor is apparently nothing else than 
"reverence shown to a person in recognition of his virtue," as the 
Philosopher states (Ethic. i, 5). Now prelates and princes should be 
honored although they be wicked, even as our parents, of whom it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++20%3A12">Ex. 20:12</a>): "Honor thy father and thy mother." Again masters, 
though they be wicked, should be honored by their servants, according to 
1 Tim. 6:1: "Whoever are servants under the yoke, let them count their 
masters worthy of all honor." Therefore it seems that it is not a sin to 
respect persons in showing honor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is commanded (Lev. 19:32): "Rise up before the hoary 
head, and, honor the person of the aged man." But this seems to savor of 
respect of persons, since sometimes old men are not virtuous; according 
to Dan. 13:5: "Iniquity came out from the ancients of the people [*Vulg.: 
'Iniquity came out of Babylon from the ancient judges, that seemed to 
govern the people.']." Therefore  it is not a sin to respect persons in 
showing honor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, on the words of James 2:1, "Have not the faith . . . 
with respect of persons," a gloss of Augustine [*Ep. ad Hieron. clxvii.] 
says: "If the saying of James, 'If there shall come into your assembly a 
man having a golden ring,' etc., refer to our daily meetings, who sins 
not here, if however he sin at all?" Yet it is respect of persons to 
honor the rich for their riches, for Gregory says in a homily (xxviii in 
Evang.): "Our pride is blunted, since in men we honor, not the nature 
wherein they are made to God's image, but wealth," so that, wealth not 
being a due cause of honor, this will savor of respect of persons. 
Therefore it is not a sin to respect persons in showing honor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on James 2:1, says: "Whoever honors the rich 
for their riches, sins," and in like manner, if a man be honored for 
other causes that do not render him worthy of honor. Now this savors of 
respect of persons. Therefore it is a sin to respect persons in showing 
honor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> To honor a person is to recognize him as having virtue, 
wherefore virtue alone is the due cause of a person being honored. Now it 
is to be observed that a person may be honored not only for his own 
virtue, but also for another's: thus princes and prelates, although they 
be wicked, are honored as standing in God's place, and as representing 
the community over which they are placed, according to Prov. 26:8, "As he 
that casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury, so is he that giveth honor 
to a fool." For, since the gentiles ascribed the keeping of accounts to 
Mercury, "the heap of Mercury" signifies the casting up of an account, 
when a merchant sometimes substitutes a pebble [*'Lapillus' or 'calculus' 
whence the English word 'calculate'] for one hundred marks. So too, is a 
fool honored if he stand in God's place or represent the whole community: 
and in the same way parents and masters should be honored, on account of 
their having a share of the dignity of God Who is the Father and Lord of 
all. The aged should be honored, because old age is a sign of virtue, 
though this sign fail at times: wherefore, according to Wis. 4:8,9, 
"venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of 
years; but the understanding of a man is gray hairs, and a spotless life 
is old age." The rich ought to be honored by reason of their occupying a 
higher position in the community: but if they be honored merely for their 
wealth, it will be the sin of respect of persons.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the sin of respect of persons does not take 
place in judicial sentences. For respect of persons is opposed to 
distributive justice, as stated above (<A Href="SS063.html#SSQ63A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>): whereas  judicial sentences 
seem to pertain chiefly to commutative justice. Therefore respect of 
persons does not take place in judicial sentences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, penalties are inflicted according to a sentence. Now it 
is not a sin to respect persons in pronouncing penalties, since a heavier 
punishment is inflicted on one who injures the person of a prince than on 
one who injures the person of others. Therefore respect of persons does 
not take place in judicial sentences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (Ecclus. 4:10): "In judging be merciful to 
the fatherless." But this seems to imply respect of the person of the 
needy. Therefore in judicial sentences respect of persons is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++18%3A5">Prov. 18:5</a>): "It is not good to accept 
the person in judgment [*Vulg.: 'It is not good to accept the person of 
the wicked, to decline from the truth of judgment.']."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS060.html#SSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>, <A Href="SS060.html#SSQ60A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), judgment is an act of 
justice, in as much as the judge restores to the equality of justice, 
those things which may cause an opposite inequality. Now respect of 
persons involves a certain inequality, in so far as something is allotted 
to a person out of that proportion to him in which the equality of 
justice consists. Wherefore it is evident that judgment is rendered 
corrupt by respect of persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A judgment may be looked at in two ways. First, in view of 
the thing judged, and in this way judgment is common to commutative and 
distributive justice: because it may be decided by judgment how some 
common good is to be distributed among many, and how one person is to 
restore to another what he has taken from him. Secondly, it may be 
considered in view of the form of judgment, in as much as, even in 
commutative justice, the judge takes from one and gives to another, and 
this belongs to distributive justice. In this way respect of persons may 
take place in any judgment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[63] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When a person is more severely punished on account of a 
crime committed against a greater person, there is no respect of persons, 
because the very difference of persons causes, in that case, a diversity
