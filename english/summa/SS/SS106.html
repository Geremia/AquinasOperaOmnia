<H3 Align="Center">OF THANKFULNESS OR GRATITUDE (SIX ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider thankfulness or gratitude, and ingratitude. 
Concerning thankfulness there are six points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether thankfulness is a special virtue distinct from other virtues?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A2THEP1">(2)</a> Who owes more thanks to God, the innocent or the penitent?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether man is always bound to give thanks for human favors?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether thanksgiving should be deferred?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether thanksgiving should be measured according to the favor 
received or the disposition of the giver?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether one ought to pay back more than one has received?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that thankfulness is not a special virtue, distinct from 
other virtue. For we have received the greatest benefits from God, and 
from our parents. Now the honor which we pay to God in return belongs to 
the virtue of religion, and the honor with which we repay our parents 
belongs to the virtue of piety. Therefore thankfulness or gratitude is 
not distinct from the other virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, proportionate repayment belongs to commutative justice, 
according to the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 4). Now the purpose of giving 
thanks is repayment (Ethic. 5,4). Therefore thanksgiving, which belongs 
to gratitude, is an act of justice. Therefore gratitude is not a special 
virtue, distinct from other virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, acknowledgment of favor received is requisite for the 
preservation of friendship, according to the Philosopher  (Ethic. viii, 
13; ix, 1). Now friendship is associated with all the virtues, since they 
are the reason for which man is loved. Therefore thankfulness or 
gratitude, to which it belongs to repay favors received, is not a special 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully reckons thankfulness a special part of justice 
(De Invent. Rhet. ii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), the nature of the debt 
to be paid must needs vary according to various causes giving rise to the 
debt, yet so that the greater always includes the lesser. Now the cause 
of debt is found primarily and chiefly in God, in that He is the first 
principle of all our goods: secondarily it is found in our father, 
because he is the proximate principle of our begetting and upbringing: 
thirdly it is found in the person that excels in dignity, from whom 
general favors proceed; fourthly it is found in a benefactor, from whom 
we have received particular and private favors, on account of which we 
are under particular obligation to him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, since what we owe God, or our father, or a person excelling 
in dignity, is not the same as what we owe a benefactor from whom we have 
received some particular favor, it follows that after religion, whereby 
we pay God due worship, and piety, whereby we worship our parents, and 
observance, whereby we worship persons excelling in dignity, there is 
thankfulness or gratitude, whereby we give thanks to our benefactors. And 
it is distinct from the foregoing virtues, just as each of these is 
distinct from the one that precedes, as falling short thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as religion is superexcelling piety, so is it 
excelling thankfulness or gratitude: wherefore giving thanks to God was 
reckoned above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83OUTP1">Question [83]</a>, <A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A17THEP1">Article [17]</a>) among things pertaining to religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Proportionate repayment belongs to commutative justice, 
when it answers to the legal due; for instance when it is contracted that 
so much be paid for so much. But the repayment that belongs to the virtue 
of thankfulness or gratitude answers to the moral debt, and is paid 
spontaneously. Hence thanksgiving is less thankful when compelled, as 
Seneca observes (De Beneficiis iii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since true friendship is based on virtue, whatever there is 
contrary to virtue in a friend is an obstacle to friendship, and whatever 
in him is virtuous is an incentive to friendship. In this way friendship 
is preserved by repayment of favors, although repayment of favors belongs 
specially to the virtue of gratitude.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the innocent is more bound to give thanks to God than the penitent?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the innocent is more bound to give thanks  to God 
than the penitent. For the greater the gift one has received from God, 
the more one is bound to give Him thanks. Now the gift of innocence is 
greater than that of justice restored. Therefore it seems that the 
innocent is more bound to give thanks to God than the penitent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man owes love to his benefactor just as he owes him 
gratitude. Now Augustine says (Confess. ii): "What man, weighing his own 
infirmity, would dare to ascribe his purity and innocence to his own 
strength; that so he should love Thee the less, as if he had less needed 
Thy mercy, whereby Thou remittest sins to those that turn to Thee?" And 
farther on he says: "And for this let him love Thee as much, yea and 
more, since by Whom he sees me to have been recovered from such deep 
torpor of sin, by Him he sees himself to have been from the like torpor 
of sin preserved." Therefore the innocent is also more bound to give 
thanks than the penitent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the more a gratuitous favor is continuous, the greater 
the thanksgiving due for it. Now the favor of divine grace is more 
continuous in the innocent than in the penitent. For Augustine says 
(Confess. iii): "To Thy grace I ascribe it, and to Thy mercy, that Thou 
hast melted away my sins as it were ice. To Thy grace I ascribe also 
whatsoever I have not done of evil; for what might I not have done? . . . 
Yea, all I confess to have been forgiven me, both what evils I committed 
by my own wilfulness, and what by Thy guidance committed not." Therefore 
the innocent is more bound to give thanks than the penitent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++7:43">Lk. 7:43</a>): "To whom more is forgiven, he 
loveth more [*Vulg.: 'To whom less is forgiven, he loveth less' Lk. 
7:47]." Therefore for the same reason he is bound to greater thanksgiving.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Thanksgiving [gratiarum actio] in the recipient 
corresponds to the favor [gratia] of the giver: so that when there is 
greater favor on the part of the giver, greater thanks are due on the 
part of the recipient. Now a favor is something bestowed "gratis": 
wherefore on the part of the giver the favor may be greater on two 
counts. First, owing to the quantity of the thing given: and in this way 
the innocent owes greater thanksgiving, because he receives a greater 
gift from God, also, absolutely speaking, a more continuous gift, other 
things being equal. Secondly, a favor may be said to be greater, because 
it is given more gratuitously; and in this sense the penitent is more 
bound to give thanks than the innocent, because what he receives from God 
is more gratuitously given: since, whereas he was deserving of 
punishment, he has received grace. Wherefore, although the gift bestowed 
on the innocent is, considered absolutely, greater, yet the gift bestowed 
on the penitent is greater in relation to him: even as a small gift 
bestowed on a poor man is greater to him than a great gift is to a rich 
man. And since actions are about singulars, in matters of action, we have 
to take note of what is such here and now, rather than of what is such 
absolutely, as the  Philosopher observes (Ethic. iii) in treating of the 
voluntary and the involuntary.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man is bound to give thanks to every benefactor?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the a man is not bound to give thanks to every 
benefactor. For a man may benefit himself just as he may harm himself, 
according to Ecclus. 14:5, "He that is evil to himself, to whom will he 
be good?" But a man cannot thank himself, since thanksgiving seems to 
pass from one person to another. Therefore thanksgiving is not due to 
every benefactor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, gratitude is a repayment of an act of grace. But some 
favors are granted without grace, and are rudely, slowly and grudgingly 
given. Therefore gratitude is not always due to a benefactor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no thanks are due to one who works for his own profit. 
But sometimes people bestow favors for their own profit. Therefore thanks 
are not due to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, no thanks are due to a slave, for all that he is belongs 
to his master. Yet sometimes a slave does a good turn to his master. 
Therefore gratitude is not due to every benefactor .<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, no one is bound to do what he cannot do equitably and 
advantageously. Now it happens at times that the benefactor is very well 
off, and it would be of no advantage to him to be repaid for a favor he 
has bestowed. Again it happens sometimes that the benefactor from being 
virtuous has become wicked, so that it would not seem equitable to repay 
him. Also the recipient of a favor may be a poor man, and is quite unable 
to repay. Therefore seemingly a man is not always bound to repayment for 
favors received.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, no one is bound to do for another what is inexpedient 
and hurtful to him. Now sometimes it happens that repayment of a favor 
would be hurtful or useless to the person repaid. Therefore favors are 
not always to be repaid by gratitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Thess++5:18">1 Thess. 5:18</a>): "In all things give 
thanks."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Every effect turns naturally to its cause; wherefore 
Dionysius says (Div. Nom. i) that "God turns all things to Himself 
because He is the cause of all": for the effect must needs always be 
directed to the end of the agent. Now it is evident that a benefactor, as 
such, is cause of the beneficiary. Hence the natural order requires that 
he who has received a favor should, by repaying the favor, turn to his 
benefactor according to the mode of each. And, as stated above with 
regard to a father (<A Href="SS031.html#SSQ31OUTP1">Question [31]</a>, <A Href="SS031.html#SSQ31A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="SS101.html#SSQ101OUTP1">Question [101]</a>,  <A Href="SS101.html#SSQ101A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), a man owes his 
benefactor, as such, honor and reverence, since the latter stands to him 
in the relation of principle; but accidentally he owes him assistance or 
support, if he need it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the words of Seneca (1 Benef. v), "just as a man is 
liberal who gives not to himself but to others, and gracious who forgives 
not himself but others, and merciful who is moved, not by his own 
misfortunes but by another's, so too, no man confers a favor on himself, 
he is but following the bent of his nature, which moves him to resist 
what hurts him, and to seek what is profitable." Wherefore in things that 
one does for oneself, there is no place for gratitude or ingratitude, 
since a man cannot deny himself a thing except by keeping it. 
Nevertheless things which are properly spoken of in relation to others 
are spoken of metaphorically in relation to oneself, as the Philosopher 
states regarding justice (Ethic. v, 11), in so far, to wit, as the 
various parts of man are considered as though they were various persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is the mark of a happy disposition to see good rather 
than evil. Wherefore if someone has conferred a favor, not as he ought to 
have conferred it, the recipient should not for that reason withhold his 
thanks. Yet he owes less thanks, than if the favor had been conferred 
duly, since in fact the favor is less, for, as Seneca remarks (De Benef. 
ii.) "promptness enhances, delay discounts a favor."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Seneca observes (De Benef. vi), "it matters much whether 
a person does a kindness to us for his own sake, or for ours, or for both 
his and ours. He that considers himself only, and benefits because cannot 
otherwise benefit himself, seems to me like a man who seeks fodder for 
his cattle." And farther on: "If he has done it for me in common with 
himself, having both of us in his mind, I am ungrateful and not merely 
unjust, unless I rejoice that what was profitable to him is profitable to 
me also. It is the height of malevolence to refuse to recognize a 
kindness, unless the giver has been the loser thereby."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As Seneca observes (De Benef. iii), "when a slave does what 
is wont to be demanded of a slave, it is part of his service: when he 
does more than a slave is bound to do, it is a favor: for as soon as he 
does anything from a motive of friendship, if indeed that be his motive, 
it is no longer called service." Wherefore gratitude is due even to a 
slave, when he does more than his duty.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> A poor man is certainly not ungrateful if he does what he 
can. For since kindness depends on the heart rather than on the deed, so 
too gratitude depends chiefly the heart. Hence Seneca says (De Benef. 
ii): "Who receives a favor gratefully, has already begun to pay it back: 
and that we are grateful for favors received should be shown by the 
outpourings of the heart, not only in his hearing but everywhere." From 
this it is evident that however well off a man may be, it is possible to 
thank him for his kindness by showing him reverence and honor. Wherefore 
the Philosopher says  (Ethic. viii, 14): "He that abounds should be 
repaid with honor, he that is in want should be repaid with money": and 
Seneca writes (De Benef. vi): "There are many ways of repaying those who 
are well off, whatever we happen to owe them; such as good advice, 
frequent fellowship, affable and pleasant conversation without flattery." 
Therefore there is no need for a man to desire neediness or distress in 
his benefactor before repaying his kindness, because, as Seneca says (De 
Benef. vi), "it were inhuman to desire this in one from whom you have 
received no favor; how much more so to desire it in one whose kindness 
has made you his debtor!"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, the benefactor has lapsed from virtue, nevertheless he 
should be repaid according to his state, that he may return to virtue if 
possible. But if he be so wicked as to be incurable, then his heart has 
changed, and consequently no repayment is due for his kindness, as 
heretofore. And yet, as far as it possible without sin, the kindness he 
has shown should be held in memory, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. ix, 
3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[3] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> As stated in the preceding reply, repayment of a favor 
depends chiefly on the affection of the heart: wherefore repayment should 
be made in such a way as to prove most beneficial. If, however, through 
the benefactor's carelessness it prove detrimental to him, this is not 
imputed to the person who repays him, as Seneca observes (De Benef. vii): 
"It is my duty to repay, and not to keep back and safeguard my repayment."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a man is bound to repay a favor at once. For we are 
bound to restore at once what we owe, unless the term be fixed. Now there 
is no term prescribed for the repayment of favors, and yet this repayment 
is a duty, as stated above (<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore a man is bound to repay a 
favor at once.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a good action would seem to be all the more praiseworthy 
according as it is done with greater earnestness. Now earnestness seems 
to make a man do his duty without any delay. Therefore it is apparently 
more praiseworthy to repay a favor at once.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Seneca says (De Benef. ii) that "it is proper to a 
benefactor to act freely and quickly." Now repayment ought to equal the 
favor received. Therefore it should be done at once.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Seneca says (De Benef. iv): "He that hastens to repay, 
is animated with a sense, not of gratitude but of indebtedness."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Just as in conferring a favor two things are to be 
considered, namely, the affection of the heart and the gift, so also must 
these things be considered in repaying the favor. As regards the 
affection of the heart, repayment should be made at  once, wherefore 
Seneca says (De Benef. ii): "Do you wish to repay a favor? Receive it 
graciously." As regards the gift, one ought to wait until such a time as 
will be convenient to the benefactor. In fact, if instead of choosing a 
convenient time, one wished to repay at once, favor for favor, it would 
not seem to be a virtuous, but a constrained repayment. For, as Seneca 
observes (De Benef. iv), "he that wishes to repay too soon, is an 
unwilling debtor, and an unwilling debtor is ungrateful."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A legal debt must be paid at once, else the equality of 
justice would not be preserved, if one kept another's property without 
his consent. But a moral debt depends on the equity of the debtor: and 
therefore it should be repaid in due time according as the rectitude of 
virtue demands.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Earnestness of the will is not virtuous unless it be 
regulated by reason; wherefore it is not praiseworthy to forestall the 
proper time through earnestness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Favors also should be conferred at a convenient time and 
one should no longer delay when the convenient time comes; and the same 
is to be observed in repaying favors.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in giving thanks we should look at the benefactor's disposition or at the deed?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that in repaying favors we should not look at the 
benefactor's disposition but at the deed. For repayment is due to 
beneficence, and beneficence consists in deeds, as the word itself 
denotes. Therefore in repaying favors we should look at the deed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, thanksgiving, whereby we repay favors, is a part of 
justice. But justice considers equality between giving and taking. 
Therefore also in repaying favors we should consider the deed rather than 
the disposition of the benefactor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one can consider what he does not know. Now God alone 
knows the interior disposition. Therefore it is impossible to repay a 
favor according to the benefactor's disposition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Seneca says (De Benef. i): "We are sometimes under a 
greater obligation to one who has given little with a large heart, and 
has bestowed a small favor, yet willingly."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The repayment of a favor may belong to three virtues, 
namely, justice, gratitude and friendship. It belongs to justice when the 
repayment has the character of a legal debt, as in a loan and the like: 
and in such cases repayment must be made according to the quantity 
received.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, repayment of a favor belongs, though in  different 
ways, to friendship and likewise to the virtue of gratitude when it has 
the character of a moral debt. For in the repayment of friendship we have 
to consider the cause of friendship; so that in the friendship that is 
based on the useful, repayment should be made according to the usefulness 
accruing from the favor conferred, and in the friendship based on virtue 
repayment should be made with regard for the choice or disposition of the 
giver, since this is the chief requisite of virtue, as stated in Ethic. 
viii, 13. And likewise, since gratitude regards the favor inasmuch as it 
is bestowed gratis, and this regards the disposition of the giver, it 
follows again that repayment of a favor depends more on the disposition 
of the giver than on the effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Every moral act depends on the will. Hence a kindly action, 
in so far as it is praiseworthy and is deserving of gratitude, consists 
materially in the thing done, but formally and chiefly in the will. Hence 
Seneca says (De Benef. i): "A kindly action consists not in deed or gift, 
but in the disposition of the giver or doer."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Gratitude is a part of justice, not indeed as a species is 
part of a genus, but by a kind of reduction to the genus of justice, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS080.html#SSQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>). Hence it does not follow that we shall find the 
same kind of debt in both virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God alone sees man's disposition in itself: but in so far 
as it is shown by certain signs, man also can know it. It is thus that a 
benefactor's disposition is known by the way in which he does the kindly 
action, for instance through his doing it joyfully and readily.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the repayment of gratitude should surpass the favor received?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that there is no need for the repayment of gratitude to 
surpass the favor received. For it is not possible to make even equal 
repayment to some, for instance, one's parents, as the Philosopher states 
(Ethic. viii, 14). Now virtue does not attempt the impossible. Therefore 
gratitude for a favor does not tend to something yet greater.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if one person repays another more than he has received 
by his favor, by that very fact he gives him something his turn, as it 
were. But the latter owes him repayment for the favor which in his turn 
the former has conferred on him. Therefore he that first conferred a 
favor will be bound to a yet greater repayment, and so on indefinitely. 
Now virtue does not strive at the indefinite, since "the indefinite 
removes the nature of good" (Metaph. ii, text. 8). Therefore repayment of 
gratitude should not surpass the favor received.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, justice consists in equality. But "more" is  excess of 
equality. Since therefore excess is sinful in every virtue, it seems that 
to repay more than the favor received is sinful and opposed to justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 5): "We should repay 
those who are gracious to us, by being gracious to them return," and this 
is done by repaying more than we have received. Therefore gratitude 
should incline to do something greater.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), gratitude regards the favor 
received according the intention of the benefactor; who seems be 
deserving of praise, chiefly for having conferred the favor gratis 
without being bound to do so. Wherefore the beneficiary is under a moral 
obligation to bestow something gratis in return. Now he does not seem to 
bestow something gratis, unless he exceeds the quantity of the favor 
received: because so long as he repays less or an equivalent, he would 
seem to do nothing gratis, but only to return what he has received. 
Therefore gratitude always inclines, as far as possible, to pay back 
something more.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 5; <A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A3A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), in repaying favors we 
must consider the disposition rather than the deed. Accordingly, if we 
consider the effect of beneficence, which a son receives from his parents 
namely, to be and to live, the son cannot make an equal repayment, as the 
Philosopher states (Ethic. viii, 14). But if we consider the will of the 
giver and of the repayer, then it is possible for the son to pay back 
something greater to his father, as Seneca declares (De Benef. iii). If, 
however, he were unable to do so, the will to pay back would be 
sufficient for gratitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The debt of gratitude flows from charity, which the more it 
is paid the more it is due, according to Rm. 13:8, "Owe no man anything, 
but to love one another." Wherefore it is not unreasonable if the 
obligation of gratitude has no limit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[106] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As in injustice, which is a cardinal virtue, we consider 
equality of things, so in gratitude we consider equality of wills. For 
while on the one hand the benefactor of his own free-will gave something 
he was not bound to give, so on the other hand the beneficiary repays 
something over and above what he has received.<br>
