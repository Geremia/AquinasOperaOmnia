  <h3 align="center">OF RELIGION (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider each of the foregoing virtues, in so far as our present
    scope demands. We shall consider (1) religion, (2) piety, (3) observance,
    (4) gratitude, (5) revenge, (6) truth, (7) friendship, (8) liberality, (9)
    {epieikeia}. Of the other virtues that have been mentioned we have spoken
    partly in the treatise on charity, viz. of concord and the like, and partly
    in this treatise on justice, for instance, of right commutations and of
    innocence. of legislative justice we spoke in the treatise on prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Religion offers a threefold consideration: (1) Religion considered in
    itself; (2) its acts; (3) the opposite vices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether religion regards only our
    relation to God?
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether religion is a virtue?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether religion is one virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether religion is a special
    virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether religion is a theological
    virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether religion should be
    preferred to the other moral virtues?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether religion has any external
    actions?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether religion is the same as
    holiness?

  <h3 align="left">Whether religion directs man to God alone?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that religion does not direct man
    to God alone. It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+1%3A27"
      >James 1:27</a
    >): "Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to
    visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself
    unspotted from this world." Now "to visit the fatherless and widows"
    indicates an order between oneself and one's neighbor, and "to keep oneself
    unspotted from this world" belongs to the order of a man within himself.
    Therefore religion does not imply order to God alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x, 1) that
    "since in speaking Latin not only unlettered but even most cultured persons
    ere wont to speak of religion as being exhibited, to our human kindred and
    relations as also to those who are linked with us by any kind of tie, that
    term does not escape ambiguity when it is a question of Divine worship, so
    that we be able to say without hesitation that religion is nothing else but
    the worship of God." Therefore religion signifies a relation not only to God
    but also to our kindred.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, seemingly "latria" pertains to religion.
    Now "latria signifies servitude," as Augustine states (De Civ. Dei x, 1).
    And we are bound to serve not only God, but also our neighbor, according to
    Gal. 5:13, "By charity of the spirit serve one another." Therefore religion
    includes a relation to one's neighbor also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, worship belongs to religion. Now man is
    said to worship not only God, but also his neighbor, according to the saying
    of Cato [*Dionysius Cato, Breves Sententiae], "Worship thy parents."
    Therefore religion directs us also to our neighbor, and not only to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, all those who are in the state of grace
    are subject to God. Yet not all who are in a state of grace are called
    religious, but only those who bind themselves by certain vows and
    observances, and to obedience to certain men. Therefore religion seemingly
    does not denote a relation of subjection of man to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully says (Rhet. ii, 53) that "religion
    consists in offering service and ceremonial rites to a superior nature that
    men call divine."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> as Isidore says (Etym. x), "according to
    Cicero, a man is said to be religious from 'religio,' because he often
    ponders over, and, as it were, reads again [relegit], the things which
    pertain to the worship of God," so that religion would seem to take its name
    from reading over those things which belong to Divine worship because we
    ought frequently to ponder over such things in our hearts, according to
    Prov. 3:6, "In all thy ways think on Him." According to Augustine (De Civ.
    Dei x, 3) it may also take its name from the fact that "we ought to seek God
    again, whom we had lost by our neglect" [*St. Augustine plays on the words
    'reeligere,' i.e. to choose over again, and 'negligere,' to neglect or
    despise.]. Or again, religion may be derived from "religare" [to bind
    together], wherefore Augustine says (De Vera Relig. 55): "May religion bind
    us to the one Almighty God." However, whether religion take its name from
    frequent reading, or from a repeated choice of what has been lost through
    negligence, or from being a bond, it denotes properly a relation to God. For
    it is He to Whom we ought to be bound as to our unfailing principle; to Whom
    also our choice should be resolutely directed as to our last end; and Whom
    we lose when we neglect Him by sin, and should recover by believing in Him
    and confessing our faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Religion has two kinds of acts. Some are
    its proper and immediate acts, which it elicits, and by which man is
    directed to God alone, for instance, sacrifice, adoration and the like. But
    it has other acts, which it produces through the medium of the virtues which
    it commands, directing them to the honor of God, because the virtue which is
    concerned with the end, commands the virtues which are concerned with the
    means. Accordingly "to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation"
    is an act of religion as commanding, and an act of mercy as eliciting; and
    "to keep oneself unspotted from this world" is an act of religion as
    commanding, but of temperance or of some similar virtue as eliciting.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Religion is referred to those things one
    exhibits to one's human kindred, if we take the term religion in a broad
    sense, but not if we take it in its proper sense. Hence, shortly before the
    passage quoted, Augustine says: "In a stricter sense religion seems to
    denote, not any kind of worship, but the worship of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since servant implies relation to a
    lord, wherever there is a special kind of lordship there must needs be a
    special kind of service. Now it is evident that lordship belongs to God in a
    special and singular way, because He made all things, and has supreme
    dominion over all. Consequently a special kind of service is due to Him,
    which is known as "latria" in Greek; and therefore it belongs to
    religion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> We are said to worship those whom we
    honor, and to cultivate [*In the Latin the same word 'colere' stands for
    'worship' and 'cultivate']: a man's memory or presence: we even speak of
    cultivating things that are beneath us, thus a farmer [agricola] is one who
    cultivates the land, and an inhabitant [incola] is one who cultivates the
    place where he dwells. Since, however, special honor is due to God as the
    first principle of all things, to Him also is due a special kind of worship,
    which in Greek is {Eusebeia} or {Theosebeia}, as Augustine states (De Civ.
    Dei x, 1).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Although the name "religious" may be
    given to all in general who worship God, yet in a special way religious are
    those who consecrate their whole life to the Divine worship, by withdrawing
    from human affairs. Thus also the term "contemplative" is applied, not to
    those who contemplate, but to those who give up their whole lives to
    contemplation. Such men subject themselves to man, not for man's sake but
    for God's sake, according to the word of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++4%3A14"
      >Gal. 4:14</a
    >), "You... received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether religion is a virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that religion is not a virtue.
    Seemingly it belongs to religion to pay reverence to God. But reverence is
    an act of fear which is a gift, as stated above (<a
      href="SS019.html#SSQ19OUTP1"
      >Question [19]</a
    >, <a href="SS019.html#SSQ19A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>). Therefore religion is
    not a virtue but a gift<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every virtue is a free exercise of the
    will, wherefore it is described as an "elective" or voluntary "habit"
    [*Ethic. ii, 6]. Now, as stated above (<a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 3) "latria" belongs to religion, and "latria" denotes a kind of
    servitude. Therefore religion is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Ethic. ii, 1, aptitude for
    virtue is in us by nature, wherefore things pertaining to virtue belong to
    the dictate of natural reason. Now, it belongs to religion "to offer
    ceremonial worship to the Godhead" [*Cf. Article [1]], and ceremonial
    matters, as stated above (FS, Question [99], Article [3], ad 2; FS, Question
    [101]), do not belong to the dictate of natural reason. Therefore religion
    is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is enumerated with the other virtues, as
    appears from what has been said above (<a href="SS080.html#SSQ80OUTP1"
      >Question [80]</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1"
      >Question [58]</a
    >, <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4) "a virtue is that
    which makes its possessor good, and his act good likewise," wherefore we
    must needs say that every good act belongs to a virtue. Now it is evident
    that to render anyone his due has the aspect of good, since by rendering a
    person his due, one becomes suitably proportioned to him, through being
    ordered to him in a becoming manner. But order comes under the aspect of
    good, just as mode and species, according to Augustine (De Nat. Boni iii).
    Since then it belongs to religion to pay due honor to someone, namely, to
    God, it is evident that religion is a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To pay reverence to God is an act of the
    gift of fear. Now it belongs to religion to do certain things through
    reverence for God. Hence it follows, not that religion is the same as the
    gift of fear, but that it is referred thereto as to something more
    excellent; for the gifts are more excellent than the moral virtues, as
    stated above (<a href="SS009.html#SSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>,
    <a href="SS009.html#SSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even a slave can voluntarily do his duty
    by his master, and so "he makes a virtue of necessity" [*Jerome, Ep. liv, ad
    Furiam.], by doing his duty voluntarily. In like manner, to render due
    service to God may be an act of virtue, in so far as man does so
    voluntarily.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It belongs to the dictate of natural
    reason that man should do something through reverence for God. But that he
    should do this or that determinate thing does not belong to the dictate of
    natural reason, but is established by Divine or human law.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether religion is one virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that religion is not one virtue.
    Religion directs us to God, as stated above (<a
      href="SS081.html#SSQ81A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Now in God there are three Persons; and also many attributes, which
    differ at least logically from one another. Now a logical difference in the
    object suffices for a difference of virtue, as stated above (<a
      href="SS050.html#SSQ50OUTP1"
      >Question [50]</a
    >, <a href="SS050.html#SSQ50A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). Therefore
    religion is not one virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, of one virtue there is seemingly one
    act, since habits are distinguished by their acts. Now there are many acts
    of religion, for instance to worship, to serve, to vow, to pray, to
    sacrifice and many such like. Therefore religion is not one virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, adoration belongs to religion. Now
    adoration is paid to images under one aspect, and under another aspect to
    God Himself. Since, then, a difference of aspect distinguishes virtues, it
    would seem that religion is not one virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++4%3A5"
      >Eph. 4:5</a
    >): "One God [Vulg.: 'Lord'], one faith." Now true religion professes faith
    in one God. Therefore religion is one virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54OUTP1">Question [54]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1), habits are
    differentiated according to a different aspect of the object. Now it belongs
    to religion to show reverence to one God under one aspect, namely, as the
    first principle of the creation and government of things. Wherefore He
    Himself says (Malach. 1:6): "If... I be a father, where is My honor?" For it
    belongs to a father to beget and to govern. Therefore it is evident that
    religion is one virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The three Divine Persons are the one
    principle of the creation and government of things, wherefore they are
    served by one religion. The different aspects of the attributes concur under
    the aspect of first principle, because God produces all things, and governs
    them by the wisdom, will and power of His goodness. Wherefore religion is
    one virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By the one same act man both serves and
    worships God, for worship regards the excellence of God, to Whom reverence
    is due: while service regards the subjection of man who, by his condition,
    is under an obligation of showing reverence to God. To these two belong all
    acts ascribed to religion, because, by them all, man bears witness to the
    Divine excellence and to his own subjection to God, either by offering
    something to God, or by assuming something Divine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The worship of religion is paid to
    images, not as considered in themselves, nor as things, but as images
    leading us to God incarnate. Now movement to an image as image does not stop
    at the image, but goes on to the thing it represents. Hence neither "latria"
    nor the virtue of religion is differentiated by the fact that religious
    worship is paid to the images of Christ.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether religion is a special virtue, distinct from the others?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that religion is not a special
    virtue distinct from the others. Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x, 6): "Any
    action whereby we are united to God in holy fellowship, is a true
    sacrifice." But sacrifice belongs to religion. Therefore every virtuous deed
    belongs to religion; and consequently religion is not a special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++10%3A31"
      >1 Cor. 10:31</a
    >): "Do all to the glory of God." Now it belongs to religion to do anything
    in reverence of God, as stated above (<a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 2; <a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore
    religion is not a special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the charity whereby we love God is not
    distinct from the charity whereby we love our neighbor. But according to
    Ethic. viii, 8 "to be honored is almost to be loved." Therefore the religion
    whereby we honor God is not a special virtue distinct from observance, or
    "dulia," or piety whereby we honor our neighbor. Therefore religion is not a
    special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is reckoned a part of justice, distinct
    from the other parts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since virtue is directed to the good, wherever
    there is a special aspect of good, there must be a special virtue. Now the
    good to which religion is directed, is to give due honor to God. Again,
    honor is due to someone under the aspect of excellence: and to God a
    singular excellence is competent, since He infinitely surpasses all things
    and exceeds them in every way. Wherefore to Him is special honor due: even
    as in human affairs we see that different honor is due to different personal
    excellences, one kind of honor to a father, another to the king, and so on.
    Hence it is evident that religion is a special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Every virtuous deed is said to be a
    sacrifice, in so far as it is done out of reverence of God. Hence this does
    not prove that religion is a general virtue, but that it commands all other
    virtues, as stated above (<a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>,
    ad 1).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Every deed, in so far as it is done in
    God's honor, belongs to religion, not as eliciting but as commanding: those
    belong to religion as eliciting which pertain to the reverence of God by
    reason of their specific character.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The object of love is the good, but the
    object of honor and reverence is something excellent. Now God's goodness is
    communicated to the creature, but the excellence of His goodness is not.
    Hence the charity whereby God is loved is not distinct from the charity
    whereby our neighbor is loved; whereas the religion whereby God is honored,
    is distinct from the virtues whereby we honor our neighbor.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether religion is a theological virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that religion is a theological
    virtue. Augustine says (Enchiridion iii) that "God is worshiped by faith,
    hope and charity," which are theological virtues. Now it belongs to religion
    to pay worship to God. Therefore religion is a theological virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a theological virtue is one that has God
    for its object. Now religion has God for its object, since it directs us to
    God alone, as stated above (<a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A1THEP1">Article [1]</a
    >). Therefore religion is a theological virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every virtue is either theological, or
    intellectual, or moral, as is clear from what has been said (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS000.html#FSQOUTP1">Questions [57]</a>,58,62). Now it is
    evident that religion is not an intellectual virtue, because its perfection
    does not depend on the consideration of truth: nor is it a moral virtue,
    which consists properly in observing the mean between too much and too
    little. for one cannot worship God too much, according to Ecclus. 43:33,
    "Blessing the Lord, exalt Him as much as you can; for He is above all
    praise." Therefore it remains that it is a theological virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is reckoned a part of justice which is a
    moral virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS081.html#SSQ81A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >) religion pays due worship to God. Hence two things are to be considered
    in religion: first that which it offers to God, viz. worship, and this is by
    way of matter and object in religion; secondly, that to which something is
    offered, viz. God, to Whom worship is paid. And yet the acts whereby God is
    worshiped do not reach out to God himself, as when we believe God we reach
    out to Him by believing; for which reason it was stated (<a
      href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2,4) that God is the
    object of faith, not only because we believe in a God, but because we
    believe God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now due worship is paid to God, in so far as certain acts whereby God is
    worshiped, such as the offering of sacrifices and so forth, are done out of
    reverence for God. Hence it is evident that God is related to religion not
    as matter or object, but as end: and consequently religion is not a
    theological virtue whose object is the last end, but a moral virtue which is
    properly about things referred to the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The power or virtue whose action deals
    with an end, moves by its command the power or virtue whose action deals
    with matters directed to that end. Now the theological virtues, faith, hope
    and charity have an act in reference to God as their proper object:
    wherefore, by their command, they cause the act of religion, which performs
    certain deeds directed to God: and so Augustine says that God is worshiped
    by faith, hope and charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Religion directs man to God not as its
    object but as its end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Religion is neither a theological nor an
    intellectual, but a moral virtue, since it is a part of justice, and
    observes a mean, not in the passions, but in actions directed to God, by
    establishing a kind of equality in them. And when I say "equality," I do not
    mean absolute equality, because it is not possible to pay God as much as we
    owe Him, but equality in consideration of man's ability and God's
    acceptance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And it is possible to have too much in matters pertaining to the Divine
    worship, not as regards the circumstance of quantity, but as regards other
    circumstances, as when Divine worship is paid to whom it is not due, or when
    it is not due, or unduly in respect of some other circumstance.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether religion should be preferred to the other moral virtues?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that religion should not be
    preferred to the other moral virtues. The perfection of a moral virtue
    consists in its observing the mean, as stated in Ethic. ii, 6. But religion
    fails to observe the mean of justice, since it does not render an absolute
    equal to God. Therefore religion is not more excellent than the other moral
    virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what is offered by one man to another is
    the more praiseworthy, according as the person it is offered to is in
    greater need: wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++57%3A7"
      >Is. 57:7</a
    >): "Deal thy bread to the hungry." But God needs nothing that we can offer
    Him, according to Ps. 15:2, "I have said: Thou art my God, for Thou hast no
    need of my goods." Therefore religion would seem less praiseworthy than the
    other virtues whereby man's needs are relieved.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the greater. the obligation to do a
    thing, the less praise does it deserve, according to 1 Cor. 9:16, "If I
    preach the Gospel, it is no glory to me: a necessity lieth upon me." Now the
    more a thing is due, the greater the obligation of paying it. Since, then,
    what is paid to God by man is in the highest degree due to Him, it would
    seem that religion is less praiseworthy than the other human virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The precepts pertaining to religion are given
    precedence (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++20">Ex. 20</a
    >) as being of greatest importance. Now the order of precepts is
    proportionate to the order of virtues, since the precepts of the Law
    prescribe acts of virtue. Therefore religion is the chief of the moral
    virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Whatever is directed to an end takes its
    goodness from being ordered to that end; so that the nearer it is to the end
    the better it is. Now moral virtues, as stated above (<a
      href="SS081.html#SSQ81A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >; <a href="SS004.html#SSQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>,
    <a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), are about matters that
    are ordered to God as their end. And religion approaches nearer to God than
    the other moral virtues, in so far as its actions are directly and
    immediately ordered to the honor of God. Hence religion excels among the
    moral virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Virtue is praised because of the will,
    not because of the ability: and therefore if a man fall short of equality
    which is the mean of justice, through lack of ability, his virtue deserves
    no less praise, provided there be no failing on the part of his will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In offering a thing to a man on account
    of its usefulness to him, the more needy the man the more praiseworthy the
    offering, because it is more useful: whereas we offer a thing to God not on
    account of its usefulness to Him, but for the sake of His glory, and on
    account of its usefulness to us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Where there is an obligation to do a
    thing it loses the luster of supererogation, but not the merit of virtue,
    provided it be done voluntarily. Hence the argument proves nothing.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether religion has an external act?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that religion has not an external
    act. It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++4%3A24"
      >Jn. 4:24</a
    >): "God is a spirit, and they that adore Him, must adore Him in spirit and
    in truth." Now external acts pertain, not to the spirit but to the body.
    Therefore religion, to which adoration belongs, has acts that are not
    external but internal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the end of religion is to pay God
    reverence and honor. Now it would savor of irreverence towards a superior,
    if one were to offer him that which properly belongs to his inferior. Since
    then whatever man offers by bodily actions, seems to be directed properly to
    the relief of human needs, or to the reverence of inferior creatures, it
    would seem unbecoming to employ them in showing reverence to God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine (De Civ. Dei vi, 10) commends
    Seneca for finding fault with those who offered to idols those things that
    are wont to be offered to men, because, to wit, that which befits mortals is
    unbecoming to immortals. But such things are much less becoming to the true
    God, Who is "exalted above all gods" [*Ps. 94:3]. Therefore it would seem
    wrong to worship God with bodily actions. Therefore religion has no bodily
    actions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++83%3A3"
      >Ps. 83:3</a
    >): "My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God." Now just as
    internal actions belong to the heart, so do external actions belong to the
    members of the flesh. Therefore it seems that God ought to be worshiped not
    only by internal but also by external actions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We pay God honor and reverence, not for His
    sake (because He is of Himself full of glory to which no creature can add
    anything), but for our own sake, because by the very fact that we revere and
    honor God, our mind is subjected to Him; wherein its perfection consists,
    since a thing is perfected by being subjected to its superior, for instance
    the body is perfected by being quickened by the soul, and the air by being
    enlightened by the sun. Now the human mind, in order to be united to God,
    needs to be guided by the sensible world, since "invisible things... are
    clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made," as the Apostle
    says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++1%3A20">Rm. 1:20</a
    >). Wherefore in the Divine worship it is necessary to make use of corporeal
    things, that man's mind may be aroused thereby, as by signs, to the
    spiritual acts by means of which he is united to God. Therefore the internal
    acts of religion take precedence of the others and belong to religion
    essentially, while its external acts are secondary, and subordinate to the
    internal acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Our Lord is speaking of that which is
    most important and directly intended in the worship of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> These external things are offered to
    God, not as though He stood in need of them, according to Ps. 49:13, "Shall
    I eat the flesh of bullocks? or shall I drink the blood of goats?" but as
    signs of the internal and spiritual works, which are of themselves
    acceptable to God. Hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x, 5): "The visible
    sacrifice is the sacrament or sacred sign of the invisible sacrifice."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Idolaters are ridiculed for offering to
    idols things pertaining to men, not as signs arousing them to certain
    spiritual things, but as though they were of themselves acceptable to the
    idols; and still more because they were foolish and wicked.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether religion is the same as sanctity?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that religion is not the same as
    sanctity. Religion is a special virtue, as stated above (<a
      href="SS081.html#SSQ81A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >): whereas sanctity is a general virtue, because it makes us faithful, and
    fulfil our just obligations to God, according to Andronicus [*De
    Affectibus]. Therefore sanctity is not the same as religion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sanctity seems to denote a kind of
    purity. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. xii) that "sanctity is free from all
    uncleanness, and is perfect and altogether unspotted purity." Now purity
    would seem above all to pertain to temperance which repels bodily
    uncleanness. Since then religion belongs to justice, it would seem that
    sanctity is not the same as religion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things that are opposite members of a
    division are not identified with one another. But in an enumeration given
    above (<a href="SS080.html#SSQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>, ad 4) of the parts
    of justice, sanctity is reckoned as distinct from religion. Therefore
    sanctity is not the same as religion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++1%3A74,75"
      >Lk. 1:74,75</a
    >): "That... we may serve Him... in holiness and justice." Now, "to serve
    God" belongs to religion, as stated above (<a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 3; <a href="SS081.html#SSQ81A1A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2).
    Therefore religion is the same as sanctity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The word "sanctity" seems to have two
    significations. In one way it denotes purity; and this signification fits in
    with the Greek, for {hagios} means "unsoiled." In another way it denotes
    firmness, wherefore in olden times the term "sancta" was applied to such
    things as were upheld by law and were not to be violated. Hence a thing is
    said to be sacred [sancitum] when it is ratified by law. Again, in Latin,
    this word "sanctus" may be connected with purity, if it be resolved into
    "sanguine tinctus, since, in olden times, those who wished to be purified
    were sprinkled with the victim's blood," according to Isidore (Etym. x). In
    either case the signification requires sanctity to be ascribed to those
    things that are applied to the Divine worship; so that not only men, but
    also the temple, vessels and such like things are said to be sanctified
    through being applied to the worship of God. For purity is necessary in
    order that the mind be applied to God, since the human mind is soiled by
    contact with inferior things, even as all things depreciate by admixture
    with baser things, for instance, silver by being mixed with lead. Now in
    order for the mind to be united to the Supreme Being it must be withdrawn
    from inferior things: and hence it is that without purity the mind cannot be
    applied to God. Wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++12%3A14"
      >Heb. 12:14</a
    >): "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see
    God." Again, firmness is required for the mind to be applied to God, for it
    is applied to Him as its last end and first beginning, and such things must
    needs be most immovable. Hence the Apostle said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A38,39"
      >Rm. 8:38,39</a
    >): "I am sure that neither death, nor life... shall separate me [*Vulg.:
    'shall be able to separate us'] from the love of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, it is by sanctity that the human mind applies itself and its
    acts to God: so that it differs from religion not essentially but only
    logically. For it takes the name of religion according as it gives God due
    service in matters pertaining specially to the Divine worship, such as
    sacrifices, oblations, and so forth; while it is called sanctity, according
    as man refers to God not only these but also the works of the other virtues,
    or according as man by means of certain good works disposes himself to the
    worship of God<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sanctity is a special virtue according
    to its essence; and in this respect it is in a way identified with religion.
    But it has a certain generality, in so far as by its command it directs the
    acts of all the virtues to the Divine good, even as legal justice is said to
    be a general virtue, in so far as it directs the acts of all the virtues to
    the common good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Temperance practices purity, yet not so
    as to have the character of sanctity unless it be referred to God. Hence of
    virginity itself Augustine says (De Virgin. viii) that "it is honored not
    for what it is, but for being consecrated to God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sanctity differs from religion as
    explained above, not really but logically.<br />
