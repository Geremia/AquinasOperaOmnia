</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the subjective parts of temperance: first, those 
which are about pleasures of food; secondly, those which are about 
pleasures of sex. The first consideration will include abstinence, which 
is about meat and drink, and sobriety, which is specifically about drink.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to abstinence three points have to be considered: (1) 
Abstinence itself; (2) its act which is fasting; (3) its opposite vice 
which is gluttony. Under the first head there are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS146.html#SSQ146A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether abstinence is a virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS146.html#SSQ146A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a special virtue?

</h3>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that abstinence is not a virtue. For the Apostle says (1 
Cor. 4:20): "The kingdom of God is not in speech but in power [virtute]." 
Now the kingdom of God does not consist in abstinence, for the Apostle 
says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++14:17">Rm. 14:17</a>): "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink," where a 
gloss [*Cf. St. Augustine, Questions. Evang. ii, qu. 11] observes that "justice 
consists neither in abstaining nor in eating." Therefore abstinence is 
not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Confess. x, 11) addressing himself to 
God: "This hast Thou taught me, that I should set myself to take food as 
physic." Now it belongs not to virtue, but to the medical art to regulate 
medicine. Therefore, in like manner, to regulate one's food, which 
belongs to abstinence, is an act not of virtue but of art.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every virtue "observes the mean," as stated in Ethic. 
ii, 6,7. But abstinence seemingly inclines not to the mean but to 
deficiency, since it denotes retrenchment. Therefore abstinence is not a 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, no virtue excludes another virtue. But abstinence 
excludes patience: for Gregory says (Pastor. iii, 19) that "impatience 
not unfrequently dislodges the abstainer's mind from its peaceful 
seclusion." Likewise he says (Pastor. iii, 19) that "sometimes the sin of 
pride pierces the thoughts of the abstainer," so that abstinence excludes 
humility. Therefore abstinence is not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Pt++1:5,6">2 Pt. 1:5,6</a>): "Join with your faith 
virtue, and with virtue knowledge, and with knowledge abstinence"; where 
abstinence is numbered among other virtues. Therefore abstinence is a 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[1] Body Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Abstinence by its very name denotes retrenchment of food. 
Hence the term abstinence may be taken in two ways. First, as denoting 
retrenchment of food absolutely, and in this way it signifies neither a 
virtue nor a virtuous act, but something indifferent. Secondly, it may be 
taken as regulated by reason, and then it signifies either a virtuous 
habit or a virtuous act. This is the meaning of Peter's words quoted 
above, where he says that we ought "to join abstinence with knowledge," 
namely that in abstaining from food a man should act with due regard for 
those among whom he lives, for his own person, and for the requirements 
of health.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The use of and abstinence from food, considered in 
themselves, do not pertain to the kingdom of God, since the Apostle says 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++8:8">1 Cor. 8:8</a>): "Meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat 
not [*Vulg.: 'Neither if we eat . . . nor if we eat not'], shall we have 
the less, nor if we eat, shall we have the more," i.e. spiritually. 
Nevertheless they both belong to the kingdom of God, in so far as they 
are done reasonably through faith and love of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The regulation of food, in the point of quantity and 
quality, belongs to the art of medicine as regards the health of the 
body: but in the point of internal affections with regard to the good of 
reason, it belongs to abstinence. Hence Augustine says (Questions. Evang. ii, 
qu. 11): "It makes no difference whatever to virtue what or how much food 
a man takes, so long as he does it with due regard for the people among 
whom he lives, for his own person, and for the requirements of his 
health: but it matters how readily and uncomplainingly he does without 
food when bound by duty or necessity to abstain."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It belongs to temperance to bridle the pleasures which are 
too alluring to the soul, just as it belongs to fortitude to strengthen 
the soul against fears that deter it from the good of reason. Wherefore, 
just as fortitude is commended on account of a certain excess, from which 
all the parts of fortitude take their name, so temperance is commended 
for a kind of deficiency, from which all its parts are denominated. Hence 
abstinence, since it is a part of temperance, is named from deficiency, 
and yet it observes the mean, in so far as it is in accord with right 
reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Those vices result from abstinence in so far as it is not 
in accord with right reason. For right reason makes one abstain as one 
ought, i.e. with gladness of heart, and for the due end, i.e. for God's 
glory and not one's own.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that abstinence is not a special virtue. For every 
virtue is praiseworthy by itself. But abstinence is not praiseworthy by 
itself; for Gregory says (Pastor. iii, 19) that "the virtue of abstinence 
is praised only on account of the other  virtues." Therefore abstinence 
is not a special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine [*Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Pet. xlii) that 
"the saints abstain from meat and drink, not that any creature of God is 
evil, but merely in order to chastise the body." Now this belongs to 
chastity, as its very name denotes. Therefore abstinence is not a special 
virtue distinct from chastity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as man should be content with moderate meat, so should 
he be satisfied with moderate clothes, according to 1 Tim. 6:8, "Having 
food, and wherewith to be covered, with these we should be [Vulg.: 'are'] 
content." Now there is no special virtue in being content with moderate 
clothes. Neither, therefore, is there in abstinence which moderates food.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Macrobius [*In Somn. Scip. i, 8] reckons abstinence as 
a special part of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS136.html#SSQ136OUTP1">Question [136]</a>, <A Href="SS136.html#SSQ136A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141OUTP1">Question [141]</a>, <A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) moral virtue 
maintains the good of reason against the onslaught of the passions: hence 
whenever we find a special motive why a passion departs from the good of 
reason, there is need of a special virtue. Now pleasures of the table are 
of a nature to withdraw man from the good of reason, both because they 
are so great, and because food is necessary to man who needs it for the 
maintenance of life, which he desires above all other things. Therefore 
abstinence is a special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Virtues are of necessity connected together, as stated 
above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Wherefore one virtue receives help and 
commendation from another, as justice from fortitude. Accordingly in this 
way the virtue of abstinence receives commendation on account of the 
other virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The body is chastised by means of abstinence, not only 
against the allurements of lust, but also against those of gluttony: 
since by abstaining a man gains strength for overcoming the onslaughts of 
gluttony, which increase in force the more he yields to them. Yet 
abstinence is not prevented from being a special virtue through being a 
help to chastity, since one virtue helps another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[146] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The use of clothing was devised by art, whereas the use of 
food is from nature. Hence it is more necessary to have a special virtue 
for the moderation of food than for the moderation of clothing.<br>
