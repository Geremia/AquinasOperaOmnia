  <h3 align="center">OF ABSTINENCE (TWO ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the subjective parts of temperance: first, those which
    are about pleasures of food; secondly, those which are about pleasures of
    sex. The first consideration will include abstinence, which is about meat
    and drink, and sobriety, which is specifically about drink.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    With regard to abstinence three points have to be considered: (1) Abstinence
    itself; (2) its act which is fasting; (3) its opposite vice which is
    gluttony. Under the first head there are two points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS146.html#SSQ146A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether abstinence is a virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS146.html#SSQ146A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a special virtue?

  <h3 align="left">Whether abstinence is a virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that abstinence is not a virtue. For the
    Apostle says (1 Cor. 4:20): "The kingdom of God is not in speech but in
    power [virtute]." Now the kingdom of God does not consist in abstinence, for
    the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++14%3A17"
      >Rm. 14:17</a
    >): "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink," where a gloss [*Cf. St.
    Augustine, Questions. Evang. ii, qu. 11] observes that "justice consists
    neither in abstaining nor in eating." Therefore abstinence is not a
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Confess. x, 11)
    addressing himself to God: "This hast Thou taught me, that I should set
    myself to take food as physic." Now it belongs not to virtue, but to the
    medical art to regulate medicine. Therefore, in like manner, to regulate
    one's food, which belongs to abstinence, is an act not of virtue but of
    art.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every virtue "observes the mean," as
    stated in Ethic. ii, 6,7. But abstinence seemingly inclines not to the mean
    but to deficiency, since it denotes retrenchment. Therefore abstinence is
    not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, no virtue excludes another virtue. But
    abstinence excludes patience: for Gregory says (Pastor. iii, 19) that
    "impatience not unfrequently dislodges the abstainer's mind from its
    peaceful seclusion." Likewise he says (Pastor. iii, 19) that "sometimes the
    sin of pride pierces the thoughts of the abstainer," so that abstinence
    excludes humility. Therefore abstinence is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Pt++1%3A5,6"
      >2 Pt. 1:5,6</a
    >): "Join with your faith virtue, and with virtue knowledge, and with
    knowledge abstinence"; where abstinence is numbered among other virtues.
    Therefore abstinence is a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Abstinence by its very name denotes
    retrenchment of food. Hence the term abstinence may be taken in two ways.
    First, as denoting retrenchment of food absolutely, and in this way it
    signifies neither a virtue nor a virtuous act, but something indifferent.
    Secondly, it may be taken as regulated by reason, and then it signifies
    either a virtuous habit or a virtuous act. This is the meaning of Peter's
    words quoted above, where he says that we ought "to join abstinence with
    knowledge," namely that in abstaining from food a man should act with due
    regard for those among whom he lives, for his own person, and for the
    requirements of health.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The use of and abstinence from food,
    considered in themselves, do not pertain to the kingdom of God, since the
    Apostle says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++8%3A8"
      >1 Cor. 8:8</a
    >): "Meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat not [*Vulg.:
    'Neither if we eat... nor if we eat not'], shall we have the less, nor if we
    eat, shall we have the more," i.e. spiritually. Nevertheless they both
    belong to the kingdom of God, in so far as they are done reasonably through
    faith and love of God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The regulation of food, in the point of
    quantity and quality, belongs to the art of medicine as regards the health
    of the body: but in the point of internal affections with regard to the good
    of reason, it belongs to abstinence. Hence Augustine says (Questions. Evang.
    ii, qu. 11): "It makes no difference whatever to virtue what or how much
    food a man takes, so long as he does it with due regard for the people among
    whom he lives, for his own person, and for the requirements of his health:
    but it matters how readily and uncomplainingly he does without food when
    bound by duty or necessity to abstain."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It belongs to temperance to bridle the
    pleasures which are too alluring to the soul, just as it belongs to
    fortitude to strengthen the soul against fears that deter it from the good
    of reason. Wherefore, just as fortitude is commended on account of a certain
    excess, from which all the parts of fortitude take their name, so temperance
    is commended for a kind of deficiency, from which all its parts are
    denominated. Hence abstinence, since it is a part of temperance, is named
    from deficiency, and yet it observes the mean, in so far as it is in accord
    with right reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Those vices result from abstinence in so
    far as it is not in accord with right reason. For right reason makes one
    abstain as one ought, i.e. with gladness of heart, and for the due end, i.e.
    for God's glory and not one's own.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether abstinence is a special virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that abstinence is not a special
    virtue. For every virtue is praiseworthy by itself. But abstinence is not
    praiseworthy by itself; for Gregory says (Pastor. iii, 19) that "the virtue
    of abstinence is praised only on account of the other virtues." Therefore
    abstinence is not a special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine [*Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad
    Pet. xlii) that "the saints abstain from meat and drink, not that any
    creature of God is evil, but merely in order to chastise the body." Now this
    belongs to chastity, as its very name denotes. Therefore abstinence is not a
    special virtue distinct from chastity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as man should be content with moderate
    meat, so should he be satisfied with moderate clothes, according to 1 Tim.
    6:8, "Having food, and wherewith to be covered, with these we should be
    [Vulg.: 'are'] content." Now there is no special virtue in being content
    with moderate clothes. Neither, therefore, is there in abstinence which
    moderates food.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Macrobius [*In Somn. Scip. i, 8] reckons
    abstinence as a special part of temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS136.html#SSQ136OUTP1"
      >Question [136]</a
    >, <a href="SS136.html#SSQ136A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141OUTP1">Question [141]</a>,
    <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) moral virtue maintains
    the good of reason against the onslaught of the passions: hence whenever we
    find a special motive why a passion departs from the good of reason, there
    is need of a special virtue. Now pleasures of the table are of a nature to
    withdraw man from the good of reason, both because they are so great, and
    because food is necessary to man who needs it for the maintenance of life,
    which he desires above all other things. Therefore abstinence is a special
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Virtues are of necessity connected
    together, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Wherefore one
    virtue receives help and commendation from another, as justice from
    fortitude. Accordingly in this way the virtue of abstinence receives
    commendation on account of the other virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The body is chastised by means of
    abstinence, not only against the allurements of lust, but also against those
    of gluttony: since by abstaining a man gains strength for overcoming the
    onslaughts of gluttony, which increase in force the more he yields to them.
    Yet abstinence is not prevented from being a special virtue through being a
    help to chastity, since one virtue helps another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The use of clothing was devised by art,
    whereas the use of food is from nature. Hence it is more necessary to have a
    special virtue for the moderation of food than for the moderation of
    clothing.<br />
