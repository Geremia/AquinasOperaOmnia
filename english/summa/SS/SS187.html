    OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE COMPETENT TO RELIGIOUS (SIX ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the things that are competent to religious; and under
    this head there are six points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>

    teach, preach, and do like things?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS187.html#SSQ187A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is lawful for them to
    meddle in secular business?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS187.html#SSQ187A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether they are bound to manual
    labor?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS187.html#SSQ187A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is lawful for them to
    live on alms?

    quest?

    Whether it is lawful for religious to teach, preach, and the like?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful for religious to teach,
    preach, and the like. For it is said (VII, qu. i, can. Hoc nequaquam) in an
    ordinance of a synod of Constantinople [*Pseudosynod held by Photius in the
    year 879]: "The monastic life is one of subjection and discipleship, not of
    teaching, authority, or pastoral care." And Jerome says (ad Ripar. et
    Desider. [*Contra Vigilant. xvi]): "A monk's duty is not to teach but to
    lament." Again Pope Leo [*Leo I, Ep. cxx ad Theodoret., 6, cf. XVI, qu. i,
    can. Adjicimus]: says "Let none dare to preach save the priests of the Lord,
    be he monk or layman, and no matter what knowledge he may boast of having."
    Now it is not lawful to exceed the bounds of one's office or transgress the
    ordinance of the Church. Therefore seemingly it is unlawful for religious to
    teach, preach, and the like.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in an ordinance of the Council of Nicea
    (cf. XVI, qu. i, can. Placuit) it is laid down as follows: "It is our
    absolute and peremptory command addressed to all that monks shall not hear
    confessions except of one another, as is right, that they shall not bury the
    dead except those dwelling with them in the monastery, or if by chance a
    brother happen to die while on a visit." But just as the above belong to the
    duty of clerics, so also do preaching and teaching. Therefore since "the
    business of a monk differs from that of a cleric," as Jerome says (Ep. xiv
    ad Heliod.), it would seem unlawful for religious to preach, teach, and the
    like.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Regist. v, Ep. 1): "No man
    can fulfil ecclesiastical duties, and keep consistently to the monastic
    rule": and this is quoted XVI, qu. i, can. Nemo potest. Now monks are bound
    to keep consistently to the monastic rule. Therefore it would seem that they
    cannot fulfil ecclesiastical duties, whereof teaching and preaching are a
    part. Therefore seemingly it is unlawful for them to preach, teach, and do
    similar things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory is quoted (XVI, qu. i, can. Ex
    auctoritate) as saying: "By authority of this decree framed in virtue of our
    apostolic power and the duty of our office, be it lawful to monk priests who
    are configured to the apostles, to preach, baptize, give communion, pray for
    sinners, impose penance, and absolve from sin."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing is declared to be unlawful to a person
    in two ways. First, because there is something in him contrary to that which
    is declared unlawful to him: thus to no man is it lawful to sin, because
    each man has in himself reason and an obligation to God's law, to which
    things sin is contrary. And in this way it is said to be unlawful for a
    person to preach, teach, or do like things, because there is in him
    something incompatible with these things, either by reason of a
    precept---thus those who are irregular by ordinance of the Church may not be
    raised to the sacred orders---or by reason of sin, according to Ps. 49:16,
    "But to the sinner God hath said: Why dost thou declare My justice?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way it is not unlawful for religious to preach, teach, and do like
    things, both because they are bound neither by vow nor by precept of their
    rule to abstain from these things, and because they are not rendered less
    apt for these things by any sin committed, but on the contrary they are the
    more apt through having taken upon themselves the practice of holiness. For
    it is foolish to say that a man is rendered less fit for spiritual duties
    through advancing himself in holiness; and consequently it is foolish to
    declare that the religious state is an obstacle to the fulfilment of such
    like duties. This error is rejected by Pope Boniface [*Boniface IV] for the
    reasons given above. His words which are quoted (XVI, qu. i, can. Sunt.
    nonnulli) are these: "There are some who without any dogmatic proof, and
    with extreme daring, inspired with a zeal rather of bitterness than of love,
    assert that monks though they be dead to the world and live to God, are
    unworthy of the power of the priestly office, and that they cannot confer
    penance, nor christen, nor absolve in virtue of the power divinely bestowed
    on them in the priestly office. But they are altogether wrong." He proves
    this first because it is not contrary to the rule; thus he continues: "For
    neither did the Blessed Benedict the saintly teacher of monks forbid this in
    any way," nor is it forbidden in other rules. Secondly, he refutes the above
    error from the usefulness of the monks, when he adds at the end of the same
    chapter: "The more perfect a man is, the more effective is he in these,
    namely in spiritual works."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, a thing is said to be unlawful for a man, not on account of there
    being in him something contrary thereto, but because he lacks that which
    enables him to do it: thus it is unlawful for a deacon to say mass, because
    he is not in priestly orders; and it is unlawful for a priest to deliver
    judgment because he lacks the episcopal authority. Here, however, a
    distinction must be made. Because those things which are a matter of an
    order, cannot be deputed to one who has not the order, whereas matters of
    jurisdiction can be deputed to those who have not ordinary jurisdiction:
    thus the delivery of a judgment is deputed by the bishop to a simple priest.
    In this sense it is said to be unlawful for monks and other religious to
    preach, teach, and so forth, because the religious state does not give them
    the power to do these things. They can, however, do them if they receive
    orders, or ordinary jurisdiction, or if matters of jurisdiction be delegated
    to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It results from the words quoted that
    the fact of their being monks does not give monks the power to do these
    things, yet it does not involve in them anything contrary to the performance
    of these acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Again, this ordinance of the Council of
    Nicea forbids monks to claim the power of exercising those acts on the
    ground of their being monks, but it does not forbid those acts being
    delegated to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> These two things are incompatible,
    namely, the ordinary cure of ecclesiastical duties, and the observance of
    the monastic rule in a monastery. But this does not prevent monks and other
    religious from being sometimes occupied with ecclesiastical duties through
    being deputed thereto by superiors having ordinary cure; especially members
    of religious orders that are especially instituted for that purpose, as we
    shall say further on (<a href="SS188.html#SSQ188OUTP1">Question [188]</a>,

    Whether it is lawful for religious to occupy themselves with secular
    business?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful for religious to occupy
    themselves with secular business. For in the decree quoted above (<a
      href="SS187.html#SSQ187A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >) of Pope Boniface it is said that the "Blessed Benedict bade them to be
    altogether free from secular business; and this is most explicitly
    prescribed by the apostolic doctrine and the teaching of all the Fathers,
    not only to religious, but also to all the canonical clergy," according to 2
    Tim. 2:4, "No man being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular
    business." Now it is the duty of all religious to be soldiers of God.
    Therefore it is unlawful for them to occupy themselves with secular
    business.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Thess++4%3A11"
      >1 Thess. 4:11</a
    >): "That you use your endeavor to be quiet, and that you do your own
    business," which a gloss explains thus---"by refraining from other people's
    affairs, so as to be the better able to attend to the amendment of your own
    life." Now religious devote themselves in a special way to the amendment of
    their life. Therefore they should not occupy themselves with secular
    business.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Jerome, commenting on Mt. 11:8, "Behold
    they that are clothed in soft garments are in the houses of kings," says:
    "Hence we gather that an austere life and severe preaching should avoid the
    palaces of kings and the mansions of the voluptuous." But the needs of
    secular business induce men to frequent the palaces of kings. Therefore it
    is unlawful for religious to occupy themselves with secular business.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++16%3A1"
      >Rm. 16:1</a
    >): "I commend to you Phoebe our Sister," and further on (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++16%3A2"
      >Rm. 16:2</a
    >), "that you assist her in whatsoever business she shall have need of
    you."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS186.html#SSQ186OUTP1"
      >Question [186]</a
    >, <a href="SS186.html#SSQ186ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,7, ad 1), the
    religious state is directed to the attainment of the perfection of charity,
    consisting principally in the love of God and secondarily in the love of our
    neighbor. Consequently that which religious intend chiefly and for its own
    sake is to give themselves to God. Yet if their neighbor be in need, they
    should attend to his affairs out of charity, according to Gal. 6:2, "Bear ye
    one another's burthens: and so you shall fulfil the law of Christ," since
    through serving their neighbor for God's sake, they are obedient to the
    divine love. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+1%3A27"
      >James 1:27</a
    >): "Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to
    visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation," which means,
    according to a gloss, to assist the helpless in their time of need.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must conclude therefore that it is unlawful for either monks or clerics
    to carry on secular business from motives of avarice; but from motives of
    charity, and with their superior's permission, they may occupy themselves
    with due moderation in the administration and direction of secular business.
    Wherefore it is said in the Decretals (Dist. xxxviii, can. Decrevit): "The
    holy synod decrees that henceforth no cleric shall buy property or occupy
    himself with secular business, save with a view to the care of the
    fatherless, orphans, or widows, or when the bishop of the city commands him
    to take charge of the business connected with the Church." And the same
    applies to religious as to clerics, because they are both debarred from
    secular business on the same grounds, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Monks are forbidden to occupy themselves
    with secular business from motives of avarice, but not from motives of
    charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To occupy oneself with secular business
    on account of another's need is not officiousness but charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To haunt the palaces of kings from
    motives of pleasure, glory, or avarice is not becoming to religious, but
    there is nothing unseemly in their visiting them from motives of piety.
    Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Kgs++4%3A13"
      >4 Kgs. 4:13</a
    >): "Hast thou any business, and wilt thou that I speak to the king or to
    the general of the army?" Likewise it becomes religious to go to the palaces
    of kings to rebuke and guide them, even as John the Baptist rebuked Herod,
    as related in Mt. 14:4.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether religious are bound to manual labor?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that religious are bound to manual
    labor. For religious are not exempt from the observance of precepts. Now
    manual labor is a matter of precept according to 1 Thess. 4:11, "Work with
    your own hands as we commanded you"; wherefore Augustine says (De oper.
    Monach. xxx): "But who can allow these insolent men," namely religious that
    do no work, of whom he is speaking there, "who disregard the most salutary
    admonishment of the Apostle, not merely to be borne with as being weaker
    than others, but even to preach as though they were holier than others."
    Therefore it would seem that religious are bound to manual labor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a gloss [*St. Augustine, (De oper.
    Monach. xxi)] on 2 Thess. 3:10, "If any man will not work, neither let him
    eat," says: "Some say that this command of the Apostle refers to spiritual
    works, and not to the bodily labor of the farmer or craftsman"; and further
    on: "But it is useless for them to try to hide from themselves and from
    others the fact that they are unwilling not only to fulfil, but even to
    understand the useful admonishments of charity"; and again: "He wishes God's
    servants to make a living by working with their bodies." Now religious
    especially are called servants of God, because they give themselves entirely
    to the service of God, as Dionysius asserts (Eccl. Hier. vi). Therefore it
    would seem that they are bound to manual labor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De oper. Monach. xvii):
    "I would fain know how they would occupy themselves, who are unwilling to
    work with their body. We occupy our time, say they, with prayers, psalms,
    reading, and the word of God." Yet these things are no excuse, and he proves
    this, as regards each in particular. For in the first place, as to prayer,
    he says: "One prayer of the obedient man is sooner granted than ten thousand
    prayers of the contemptuous": meaning that those are contemptuous and
    unworthy to be heard who work not with their hands. Secondly, as to the
    divine praises he adds: "Even while working with their hands they can easily
    sing hymns to God." Thirdly, with regard to reading, he goes on to say:
    "Those who say they are occupied in reading, do they not find there what the
    Apostle commanded? What sort of perverseness is this, to wish to read but
    not to obey what one reads?" Fourthly, he adds in reference to preaching
    [*Cap. xviii]: "If one has to speak, and is so busy that he cannot spare
    time for manual work, can all in the monastery do this? And since all cannot
    do this, why should all make this a pretext for being exempt? And even if
    all were able, they should do so by turns, not only so that the others may
    be occupied in other works, but also because it suffices that one speak
    while many listen." Therefore it would seem that religious should not desist
    from manual labor on account of such like spiritual works to which they
    devote themselves.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a gloss on Lk. 12:33, "Sell what you
    possess," says: "Not only give your clothes to the poor, but sell what you
    possess, that having once for all renounced all your possessions for the
    Lord's sake, you may henceforth work with the labor of your hands, so as to
    have wherewith to live or to give alms." Now it belongs properly to
    religious to renounce all they have. Therefore it would seem likewise to
    belong to them to live and give alms through the labor of their hands.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, religious especially would seem to be
    bound to imitate the life of the apostles, since they profess the state of
    perfection. Now the apostles worked with their own hands, according to 1
    Cor. 4:12: "We labor, working with our own hands." Therefore it would seem
    that religious are bound to manual labor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Those precepts that are commonly enjoined
    upon all are equally binding on religious and seculars. But the precept of
    manual labor is enjoined upon all in common, as appears from 2 Thess. 3:6,
    "Withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly," etc. (for by
    brother he signifies every Christian, according to 1 Cor. 7:12, "If any
    brother have a wife that believeth not"). Now it is written in the same
    passage (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Thess++3%3A10"
      >2 Thess. 3:10</a
    >): "If any man will not work, neither let him eat." Therefore religious are
    not bound to manual labor any more than seculars are.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Manual labor is directed to four things. First
    and principally to obtain food; wherefore it was said to the first man (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++3%3A19"
      >Gn. 3:19</a
    >): "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread," and it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++127%3A2"
      >Ps. 127:2</a
    >): "For thou shalt eat the labors of thy hands." Secondly, it is directed
    to the removal of idleness whence arise many evils; hence it is written
    (Ecclus. 33:28,29): "Send" thy slave "to work, that he be not idle, for
    idleness hath taught much evil." Thirdly, it is directed to the curbing of
    concupiscence, inasmuch as it is a means of afflicting the body; hence it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++6%3A5,6"
      >2 Cor. 6:5,6</a
    >): "In labors, in watchings, in fastings, in chastity." Fourthly, it is
    directed to almsgiving, wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++4%3A28"
      >Eph. 4:28</a
    >): "He that stole, let him now steal no more; but rather let him labor,
    working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have something
    to give to him that suffereth need." Accordingly, in so far as manual labor
    is directed to obtaining food, it comes under a necessity of precept in so
    far as it is necessary for that end: since that which is directed to an end
    derives its necessity from that end, being, in effect, so far necessary as
    the end cannot be obtained without it. Consequently he who has no other
    means of livelihood is bound to work with his hands, whatever his condition
    may be. This is signified by the words of the Apostle: "If any man will not
    work, neither let him eat," as though to say: "The necessity of manual labor
    is the necessity of meat." So that if one could live without eating, one
    would not be bound to work with one's hands. The same applies to those who
    have no other lawful means of livelihood: since a man is understood to be
    unable to do what he cannot do lawfully. Wherefore we find that the Apostle
    prescribed manual labor merely as a remedy for the sin of those who gained
    their livelihood by unlawful means. For the Apostle ordered manual labor
    first of all in order to avoid theft, as appears from Eph. 4:28, "He that
    stole, let him now steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his
    hands." Secondly, to avoid the coveting of others' property, wherefore it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Thess++4%3A11"
      >1 Thess. 4:11</a
    >): "Work with your own hands, as we commanded you, and that you walk
    honestly towards them that are without." Thirdly, to avoid the discreditable
    pursuits whereby some seek a livelihood. Hence he says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Thess++3%3A10-12"
      >2 Thess. 3:10-12</a
    >): "When we were with you, this we declared to you: that if any man will
    not work, neither let him eat. For we have heard that there are some among
    you who walk disorderly, working not at all, but curiously meddling"
    (namely, as a gloss explains it, "who make a living by meddling in unlawful
    things). Now we charge them that are such, and beseech them... that working
    with silence, they would eat their own bread." Hence Jerome states (Super
    epist. ad Galat. [*Preface to Bk. ii of Commentary]) that the Apostle said
    this "not so much in his capacity of teacher as on account of the faults of
    the people."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It must, however, be observed that under manual labor are comprised all
    those human occupations whereby man can lawfully gain a livelihood, whether
    by using his hands, his feet, or his tongue. For watchmen, couriers, and
    such like who live by their labor, are understood to live by their
    handiwork: because, since the hand is "the organ of organs" [*De Anima iii,
    8], handiwork denotes all kinds of work, whereby a man may lawfully gain a
    livelihood.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In so far as manual labor is directed to the removal of idleness, or the
    affliction of the body, it does not come under a necessity of precept if we
    consider it in itself, since there are many other means besides manual labor
    of afflicting the body or of removing idleness: for the flesh is afflicted
    by fastings and watchings, and idleness is removed by meditation on the Holy
    Scriptures and by the divine praises. Hence a gloss on Ps. 118:82, "My eyes
    have failed for Thy word," says: "He is not idle who meditates only on God's
    word; nor is he who works abroad any better than he who devotes himself to
    the study of knowing the truth." Consequently for these reasons religious
    are not bound to manual labor, as neither are seculars, except when they are
    so bound by the statutes of their order. Thus Jerome says (Ep. cxxv ad
    Rustic Monach.): "The Egyptian monasteries are wont to admit none unless
    they work or labor, not so much for the necessities of life, as for the
    welfare of the soul, lest it be led astray by wicked thoughts." But in so
    far as manual labor is directed to almsgiving, it does not come under the
    necessity of precept, save perchance in some particular case, when a man is
    under an obligation to give alms, and has no other means of having the
    wherewithal to assist the poor: for in such a case religious would be bound
    as well as seculars to do manual labor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This command of the Apostle is of
    natural law: wherefore a gloss on 2 Thess. 3:6, "That you withdraw
    yourselves from every brother walking disorderly," says, "otherwise than the
    natural order requires," and he is speaking of those who abstained from
    manual labor. Hence nature has provided man with hands instead of arms and
    clothes, with which she has provided other animals, in order that with his
    hands he may obtain these and all other necessaries. Hence it is clear that
    this precept, even as all the precepts of the natural law, is binding on
    both religious and seculars alike. Yet not everyone sins that works not with
    his hands, because those precepts of the natural law which regard the good
    of the many are not binding on each individual, but it suffices that one
    person apply himself to this business and another to that; for instance,
    that some be craftsmen, others husbandmen, others judges, and others
    teachers, and so forth, according to the words of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++12%3A17"
      >1 Cor. 12:17</a
    >), "If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the
    whole were the hearing, where would be the smelling?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This gloss is taken from Augustine's De
    operibus Monachorum, cap. 21, where he speaks against certain monks who
    declared it to be unlawful for the servants of God to work with their hands,
    on account of our Lord's saying (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A25"
      >Mt. 6:25</a
    >): "Be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat." Nevertheless his
    words do not imply that religious are bound to work with their hands, if
    they have other means of livelihood. This is clear from his adding: "He
    wishes the servants of God to make a living by working with their bodies."
    Now this does not apply to religious any more than to seculars, which is
    evident for two reasons. First, on account of the way in which the Apostle
    expresses himself, by saying: "That you withdraw yourselves from every
    brother walking disorderly." For he calls all Christians brothers, since at
    that time religious orders were not as yet founded. Secondly, because
    religious have no other obligations than what seculars have, except as
    required by the rule they profess: wherefore if their rule contain nothing
    about manual labor, religious are not otherwise bound to manual labor than
    seculars are.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A man may devote himself in two ways to
    all the spiritual works mentioned by Augustine in the passage quoted: in one
    way with a view to the common good, in another with a view to his private
    advantage. Accordingly those who devote themselves publicly to the aforesaid
    spiritual works are thereby exempt from manual labor for two reasons: first,
    because it behooves them to be occupied exclusively with such like works;
    secondly, because those who devote themselves to such works have a claim to
    be supported by those for whose advantage they work.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, those who devote themselves to such works not publicly
    but privately as it were, ought not on that account to be exempt from manual
    labor, nor have they a claim to be supported by the offerings of the
    faithful, and it is of these that Augustine is speaking. For when he says:
    "They can sing hymns to God even while working with their hands; like the
    craftsmen who give tongue to fable telling without withdrawing their hands
    from their work," it is clear that he cannot refer to those who sing the
    canonical hours in the church, but to those who tell psalms or hymns as
    private prayers. Likewise what he says of reading and prayer is to be
    referred to the private prayer and reading which even lay people do at
    times, and not to those who perform public prayers in the church, or give
    public lectures in the schools. Hence he does not say: "Those who say they
    are occupied in teaching and instructing," but: "Those who say they are
    occupied in reading." Again he speaks of that preaching which is addressed,
    not publicly to the people, but to one or a few in particular by way of
    private admonishment. Hence he says expressly: "If one has to speak." For
    according to a gloss on 1 Cor. 2:4, "Speech is addressed privately,
    preaching to many."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Those who despise all for God's sake are
    bound to work with their hands, when they have no other means of livelihood,
    or of almsgiving (should the case occur where almsgiving were a matter of
    precept), but not otherwise, as stated in the Article. It is in this sense
    that the gloss quoted is to be understood.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> That the apostles worked with their
    hands was sometimes a matter of necessity, sometimes a work of
    supererogation. It was of necessity when they failed to receive a livelihood
    from others. Hence a gloss on 1 Cor. 4:12, "We labor, working with our own
    hands," adds, "because no man giveth to us." It was supererogation, as
    appears from 1 Cor. 9:12, where the Apostle says that he did not use the
    power he had of living by the Gospel. The Apostle had recourse to this
    supererogation for three motives. First, in order to deprive the false
    apostles of the pretext for preaching, for they preached merely for a
    temporal advantage; hence he says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++11%3A12"
      >2 Cor. 11:12</a
    >): "But what I do, that I will do that I may cut off the occasion from
    them," etc. Secondly, in order to avoid burdening those to whom he preached;
    hence he says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++12%3A13"
      >2 Cor. 12:13</a
    >): "What is there that you have had less than the other churches, but that
    I myself was not burthensome to you?" Thirdly, in order to give an example
    of work to the idle; hence he says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Thess++3%3A8,9"
      >2 Thess. 3:8,9</a
    >): "We worked night and day... that we might give ourselves a pattern unto
    you, to imitate us." However, the Apostle did not do this in places like
    Athens where he had facilities for preaching daily, as Augustine observes
    (De oper. Monach. xviii). Yet religious are not for this reason bound to
    imitate the Apostle in this matter, since they are not bound to all works of
    supererogation: wherefore neither did the other apostles work with their
    hands.<br />

    Whether it is lawful for religious to live on alms?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful for religious to live on
    alms. For the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++5%3A16"
      >1 Tim. 5:16</a
    >) forbids those widows who have other means of livelihood to live on the
    alms of the Church, so that the Church may have "sufficient for them that
    are widows indeed." And Jerome says to Pope Damasus [*Cf. Cf. Can. Clericos,
    cause. i, qu. 2; Can. Quoniam, cause xvi, qu. 1; Regul. Monach. iv among the
    supposititious works of St. Jerome] that "those who have sufficient income
    from their parents and their own possessions, if they take what belongs to
    the poor they commit and incur the guilt of sacrilege, and by the abuse of
    such things they eat and drink judgment to themselves." Now religious if
    they be able-bodied can support themselves by the work of their hands.
    Therefore it would seem that they sin if they consume the alms belonging to
    the poor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to live at the expense of the faithful
    is the stipend appointed to those who preach the Gospel in payment of their
    labor or work, according to Mt. 10:10: "The workman is worthy of his meat."
    Now it belongs not to religious to preach the Gospel, but chiefly to
    prelates who are pastors and teachers. Therefore religious cannot lawfully
    live on the alms of the faithful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, religious are in the state of
    perfection. But it is more perfect to give than to receive alms; for it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+20%3A35"
      >Acts 20:35</a
    >): "It is a more blessed thing to give, rather than to receive." Therefore
    they should not live on alms, but rather should they give alms of their
    handiwork.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it belongs to religious to avoid
    obstacles to virtue and occasions of sin. Now the receiving of alms offers
    an occasion of sin, and hinders an act of virtue; hence a gloss on 2 Thess.
    3:9, "That we might give ourselves a pattern unto you," says: "He who
    through idleness eats often at another's table, must needs flatter the one
    who feeds him." It is also written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++23%3A8"
      >Ex. 23:8</a
    >): "Neither shalt thou take bribes which... blind the wise, and pervert the
    words of the just," and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++22%3A7"
      >Prov. 22:7</a
    >): "The borrower is servant to him that lendeth." This is contrary to
    religion, wherefore a gloss on 2 Thess. 3:9, "That we might give ourselves a
    pattern," etc., says, "our religion calls men to liberty." Therefore it
    would seem that religious should not live on alms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, religious especially are bound to
    imitate the perfection of the apostles; wherefore the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Phil++3%3A15"
      >Phil. 3:15</a
    >): "Let us... as many as are perfect, be thus minded." But the Apostle was
    unwilling to live at the expense of the faithful, either in order to cut off
    the occasion from the false apostles as he himself says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++11%3A12"
      >2 Cor. 11:12</a
    >), or to avoid giving scandal to the weak, as appears from 1 Cor. 9:12. It
    would seem therefore that religious ought for the same reasons to refrain
    from living on alms. Hence Augustine says (De oper. Monach. 28): "Cut off
    the occasion of disgraceful marketing whereby you lower yourselves in the
    esteem of others, and give scandal to the weak: and show men that you seek
    not an easy livelihood in idleness, but the kingdom of God by the narrow and
    strait way."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Dial. ii, 1): The Blessed
    Benedict after leaving his home and parents dwelt for three years in a cave,
    and while there lived on the food brought to him by a monk from Rome.
    Nevertheless, although he was able-bodied, we do not read that he sought to
    live by the labor of his hands. Therefore religious may lawfully live on
    alms.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A man may lawfully live on what is his or due
    to him. Now that which is given out of liberality becomes the property of
    the person to whom it is given. Wherefore religious and clerics whose
    monasteries or churches have received from the munificence of princes or of
    any of the faithful any endowment whatsoever for their support, can lawfully
    live on such endowment without working with their hands, and yet without
    doubt they live on alms. Wherefore in like manner if religious receive
    movable goods from the faithful they can lawfully live on them. For it is
    absurd to say that a person may accept an alms of some great property but
    not bread or some small sum of money. Nevertheless since these gifts would
    seem to be bestowed on religious in order that they may have more leisure
    for religious works, in which the donors of temporal goods wish to have a
    share, the use of such gifts would become unlawful for them if they
    abstained from religious works, because in that case, so far as they are
    concerned, they would be thwarting the intention of those who bestowed those
    gifts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    A thing is due to a person in two ways. First, on account of necessity,
    which makes all things common, as Ambrose [*Basil, Serm. de Temp. lxiv,
    among the supposititious works of St. Ambrose] asserts. Consequently if
    religious be in need they can lawfully live on alms. Such necessity may
    occur in three ways. First, through weakness of body, the result being that
    they are unable to make a living by working with their hands. Secondly,
    because that which they gain by their handiwork is insufficient for their
    livelihood: wherefore Augustine says (De oper. Monach. xvii) that "the good
    works of the faithful should not leave God's servants who work with their
    hands without a supply of necessaries, that when the hour comes for them to
    nourish their souls, so as to make it impossible for them to do these
    corporal works, they be not oppressed by want." Thirdly, because of the
    former mode of life of those who were unwont to work with their hands:
    wherefore Augustine says (De oper. Monach. xxi) that "if they had in the
    world the wherewithal easily to support this life without working, and gave
    it to the needy when they were converted to God, we must credit their
    weakness and bear with it." For those who have thus been delicately brought
    up are wont to be unable to bear the toil of bodily labor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In another way a thing becomes due to a person through his affording others
    something whether temporal or spiritual, according to 1 Cor. 9:11, "If we
    have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your
    carnal things?" And in this sense religious may live on alms as being due to
    them in four ways. First, if they preach by the authority of the prelates.
    Secondly, if they be ministers of the altar, according to 1 Cor. 9:13,14,
    "They that serve the altar partake with the altar. So also the lord ordained
    that they who preach the Gospel should live by the Gospel." Hence Augustine
    says (De oper. Monach. xxi): "If they be gospelers, I allow, they have" (a
    claim to live at the charge of the faithful): "if they be ministers of the
    altar and dispensers of the sacraments, they need not insist on it, but it
    is theirs by perfect right." The reason for this is because the sacrament of
    the altar wherever it be offered is common to all the faithful. Thirdly, if
    they devote themselves to the study of Holy Writ to the common profit of the
    whole Church. Wherefore Jerome says (Contra Vigil. xiii): "It is still the
    custom in Judea, not only among us but also among the Hebrews, for those who
    meditate on the law of the Lord day and night, end have no other share on
    earth but God alone, to be supported by the subscriptions of the synagogues
    and of the whole world." Fourthly, if they have endowed the monastery with
    the goods they possessed, they may live on the alms given to the monastery.
    Hence Augustine says (De oper. Monach. xxv) that "those who renouncing or
    distributing their means, whether ample or of any amount whatever, have
    desired with pious and salutary humility to be numbered among the poor of
    Christ, have a claim on the community and on brotherly love to receive a
    livelihood in return. They are to be commended indeed if they work with
    their hands, but if they be unwilling, who will dare to force them? Nor does
    it matter, as he goes on to say, to which monasteries, or in what place any
    one of them has bestowed his goods on his needy brethren; for all Christians
    belong to one commonwealth."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, in the default of any necessity, or of their affording
    any profit to others, it is unlawful for religious to wish to live in
    idleness on the alms given to the poor. Hence Augustine says (De oper.
    Monach. xxii): "Sometimes those who enter the profession of God's service
    come from a servile condition of life, from tilling the soil or working at
    some trade or lowly occupation. In their case it is not so clear whether
    they came with the purpose of serving God, or of evading a life of want and
    toil with a view to being fed and clothed in idleness, and furthermore to
    being honored by those by whom they were wont to be despised and
    downtrodden. Such persons surely cannot excuse themselves from work on the
    score of bodily weakness, for their former mode of life is evidence against
    them." And he adds further on (De oper. Monach. xxv): "If they be unwilling
    to work, neither let them eat. For if the rich humble themselves to piety,
    it is not that the poor may be exalted to pride; since it is altogether
    unseemly that in a life wherein senators become laborers, laborers should
    become idle, and that where the lords of the manor have come after
    renouncing their ease, the serfs should live in comfort."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These authorities must be understood as
    referring to cases of necessity, that is to say, when there is no other
    means of succoring the poor: for then they would be bound not only to
    refrain from accepting alms, but also to give what they have for the support
    of the needy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Prelates are competent to preach in
    virtue of their office, but religious may be competent to do so in virtue of
    delegation; and thus when they work in the field of the Lord, they may make
    their living thereby, according to 2 Tim. 2:6, "The husbandman that laboreth
    must first partake of the fruits," which a gloss explains thus, "that is to
    say, the preacher, who in the field of the Church tills the hearts of his
    hearers with the plough of God's word." Those also who minister to the
    preachers may live on alms. Hence a gloss on Rm. 15:27, "If the Gentiles
    have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in
    carnal things to minister to them," says, "namely, to the Jews who sent
    preachers from Jerusalem." There are moreover other reasons for which a
    person has a claim to live at the charge of the faithful, as stated
    above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Other things being equal, it is more
    perfect to give than to receive. Nevertheless to give or to give up all
    one's possessions for Christ's sake, and to receive a little for one's
    livelihood is better than to give to the poor part by part, as stated above
    (<a href="SS186.html#SSQ186OUTP1">Question [186]</a>,
    <a href="SS186.html#SSQ186A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 6).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> To receive gifts so as to increase one's
    wealth, or to accept a livelihood from another without having a claim to it,
    and without profit to others or being in need oneself, affords an occasion
    of sin. But this does not apply to religious, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Whenever there is evident necessity for
    religious living on alms without doing any manual work, as well as an
    evident profit to be derived by others, it is not the weak who are
    scandalized, but those who are full of malice like the Pharisees, whose
    scandal our Lord teaches us to despise (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++15%3A12-14"
      >Mt. 15:12-14</a
    >). If, however, these motives of necessity and profit be lacking, the weak
    might possibly be scandalized thereby; and this should be avoided. Yet the
    same scandal might be occasioned through those who live in idleness on the
    common revenues.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether it is lawful for religious to beg?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful for religious to beg. For
    Augustine says (De oper. Monach. xxviii): "The most cunning foe has
    scattered on all sides a great number of hypocrites wearing the monastic
    habit, who go wandering about the country," and afterwards he adds: "They
    all ask, they all demand to be supported in their profitable penury, or to
    be paid for a pretended holiness." Therefore it would seem that the life of
    mendicant religious is to be condemned.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Thess++4%3A11"
      >1 Thess. 4:11</a
    >): "That you... work with your own hands as we commanded you, and that you
    walk honestly towards them that are without: and that you want nothing of
    any man's": and a gloss on this passage says: "You must work and not be
    idle, because work is both honorable and a light to the unbeliever: and you
    must not covet that which belongs to another and much less beg or take
    anything." Again a gloss [*St. Augustine, (De oper. Monach. iii)] on 2
    Thess. 3:10, "If any man will not work," etc. says: "He wishes the servants
    of God to work with the body, so as to gain a livelihood, and not be
    compelled by want to ask for necessaries." Now this is to beg. Therefore it
    would seem unlawful to beg while omitting to work with one's hands.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which is forbidden by law and
    contrary to justice, is unbecoming to religious. Now begging is forbidden in
    the divine law; for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++15%3A4"
      >Dt. 15:4</a
    >): "There shall be no poor nor beggar among you," and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++36%3A25"
      >Ps. 36:25</a
    >): "I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread."
    Moreover an able-bodied mendicant is punished by civil law, according to the
    law (XI, xxvi, de Valid. Mendicant.). Therefore it is unfitting for
    religious to beg.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, "Shame is about that which is
    disgraceful," as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 15). Now Ambrose says (De
    Offic. i, 30) that "to be ashamed to beg is a sign of good birth." Therefore
    it is disgraceful to beg: and consequently this is unbecoming to
    religious.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, according to our Lord's command it is
    especially becoming to preachers of the Gospel to live on alms, as stated
    above (<a href="SS187.html#SSQ187A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Yet it is not
    becoming that they should beg, since a gloss on 2 Tim. 2:6, "The husbandman,
    that laboreth," etc. says: "The Apostle wishes the gospeler to understand
    that to accept necessaries from those among whom he labors is not mendicancy
    but a right." Therefore it would seem unbecoming for religious to beg.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It becomes religious to live in imitation of
    Christ. Now Christ was a mendicant, according to Ps. 39:18, "But I am a
    beggar and poor"; where a gloss says: "Christ said this of Himself as
    bearing the 'form of a servant,'" and further on: "A beggar is one who
    entreats another, and a poor man is one who has not enough for himself."
    Again it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++69%3A6"
      >Ps. 69:6</a
    >): "I am needy and poor"; where a gloss says: "'Needy,' that is a
    suppliant; 'and poor,' that is, not having enough for myself, because I have
    no worldly wealth." And Jerome says in a letter [*Reference unknown]:
    "Beware lest whereas thy Lord," i.e. Christ, "begged, thou amass other
    people's wealth." Therefore it becomes religious to beg.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Two things may be considered in reference to
    mendicancy. The first is on the part of the act itself of begging, which has
    a certain abasement attaching to it; since of all men those would seem most
    abased who are not only poor, but are so needy that they have to receive
    their meat from others. In this way some deserve praise for begging out of
    humility, just as they abase themselves in other ways, as being the most
    efficacious remedy against pride which they desire to quench either in
    themselves or in others by their example. For just as a disease that arises
    from excessive heat is most efficaciously healed by things that excel in
    cold, so proneness to pride is most efficaciously healed by those things
    which savor most of abasement. Hence it is said in the Decretals (II, cap.
    Si quis semel, de Paenitentia): "To condescend to the humblest duties, and
    to devote oneself to the lowliest service is an exercise of humility; for
    thus one is able to heal the disease of pride and human glory." Hence Jerome
    praises Fabiola (Ep. lxxvii ad ocean.) for that she desired "to receive
    alms, having poured forth all her wealth for Christ's sake." The Blessed
    Alexis acted in like manner, for, having renounced all his possessions for
    Christ's sake he rejoiced in receiving alms even from his own servants. It
    is also related of the Blessed Arsenius in the Lives of the Fathers (v, 6)
    that he gave thanks because he was forced by necessity to ask for alms.
    Hence it is enjoined to some people as a penance for grievous sins to go on
    a pilgrimage begging. Since, however, humility like the other virtues should
    not be without discretion, it behooves one to be discreet in becoming a
    mendicant for the purpose of humiliation, lest a man thereby incur the mark
    of covetousness or of anything else unbecoming. Secondly, mendicancy may be
    considered on the part of that which one gets by begging: and thus a man may
    be led to beg by a twofold motive. First, by the desire to have wealth or
    meat without working for it, and such like mendicancy is unlawful; secondly,
    by a motive of necessity or usefulness. The motive is one of necessity if a
    man has no other means of livelihood save begging; and it is a motive of
    usefulness if he wishes to accomplish something useful, and is unable to do
    so without the alms of the faithful. Thus alms are besought for the building
    of a bridge, or church, or for any other work whatever that is conducive to
    the common good: thus scholars may seek alms that they may devote themselves
    to the study of wisdom. In this way mendicancy is lawful to religious no
    less than to seculars.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine is speaking there explicitly
    of those who beg from motives of covetousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The first gloss speaks of begging from
    motives of covetousness, as appears from the words of the Apostle; while the
    second gloss speaks of those who without effecting any useful purpose, beg
    their livelihood in order to live in idleness. on the other hand, he lives
    not idly who in any way lives usefully.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This precept of the divine law does not
    forbid anyone to beg, but it forbids the rich to be so stingy that some are
    compelled by necessity to beg. The civil law imposes a penalty on
    able-bodied mendicants who beg from motives neither of utility nor of
    necessity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Disgrace is twofold; one arises from
    lack of honesty [*Cf. Question [145], Article [1]], the other from an
    external defect, thus it is disgraceful for a man to be sick or poor. Such
    like uncomeliness of mendicancy does not pertain to sin, but it may pertain
    to humility, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Preachers have the right to be fed by
    those to whom they preach: yet if they wish to seek this by begging so as to
    receive it as a free gift and not as a right this will be a mark of greater
    humility.

    Whether it is lawful for religious to wear coarser clothes than others?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful for religious to wear
    coarser clothes than others. For according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Thess++5%3A22"
      >1 Thess. 5:22</a
    >) we ought to "refrain from all appearance of evil." Now coarseness of
    clothes has an appearance of evil; for our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++7%3A15"
      >Mt. 7:15</a
    >): "Beware of false prophets who come to you in the clothing of sheep": and
    a gloss on Apoc. 6:8, "Behold a pale horse," says: "The devil finding that
    he cannot succeed, neither by outward afflictions nor by manifest heresies,
    sends in advance false brethren, who under the guise of religion assume the
    characteristics of the black and red horses by corrupting the faith."
    Therefore it would seem that religious should not wear coarse clothes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Jerome says (Ep. lii ad Nepotian.):
    "Avoid somber," i.e. black, "equally with glittering apparel. Fine and
    coarse clothes are equally to be shunned, for the one exhales pleasure, the
    other vainglory." Therefore, since vainglory is a graver sin than the use of
    pleasure, it would seem that religious who should aim at what is more
    perfect ought to avoid coarse rather than fine clothes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, religious should aim especially at doing
    works of penance. Now in works of penance we should use, not outward signs
    of sorrow, but rather signs of joy; for our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A16"
      >Mt. 6:16</a
    >): "When you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, sad," and afterwards He
    added: "But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head and wash thy face."
    Augustine commenting on these words (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 12): "In
    this chapter we must observe that not only the glare and pomp of outward
    things, but even the weeds of mourning may be a subject of ostentation, all
    the more dangerous as being a decoy under the guise of God's service."
    Therefore seemingly religious ought not to wear coarse clothes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A37"
      >Heb. 11:37</a
    >): "They wandered about in sheep-skins in goat-skins," and a gloss
    adds---"as Elias and others." Moreover it is said in the Decretal XXI, qu.
    iv, can. Omnis jactantia: "If any persons be found to deride those who wear
    coarse and religious apparel they must be reproved. For in the early times
    all those who were consecrated to God went about in common and coarse
    apparel."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. iii, 12),
    "in all external things, it is not the use but the intention of the user
    that is at fault." In order to judge of this it is necessary to observe that
    coarse and homely apparel may be considered in two ways. First, as being a
    sign of a man's disposition or condition, because according to Ecclus.
    19:27, "the attire... of the man" shows "what he is." In this way coarseness
    of attire is sometimes a sign of sorrow: wherefore those who are beset with
    sorrow are wont to wear coarser clothes, just as on the other hand in times
    of festivity and joy they wear finer clothes. Hence penitents make use of
    coarse apparel, for example, the king (Jonas 3:6) who "was clothed with
    sack-cloth," and Achab (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Kgs++21%3A27"
      >3 Kgs. 21:27</a
    >) who "put hair-cloth upon his flesh." Sometimes, however, it is a sign of
    the contempt of riches and worldly ostentation. Wherefore Jerome says (Ep.
    cxxv ad Rustico Monach.): "Let your somber attire indicate your purity of
    mind, your coarse robe prove your contempt of the world, yet so that your
    mind be not inflated withal, lest your speech belie your habit." In both
    these ways it is becoming for religious to wear coarse attire, since
    religion is a state of penance and of contempt of worldly glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But that a person wish to signify this to others arises from three motives.
    First, in order to humble himself: for just as a man's mind is uplifted by
    fine clothes, so is it humbled by lowly apparel. Hence speaking of Achab who
    "put hair-cloth on his flesh," the Lord said to Elias: "Hast thou not seen
    Achab humbled before Me?" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Kgs++21%3A29"
      >3 Kgs. 21:29</a
    >). Secondly, in order to set an example to others; wherefore a gloss on Mt.
    3:4, "(John) had his garments of camel's hair," says: "He who preaches
    penance is clothed in the habit of penance." Thirdly, on account of
    vainglory; thus Augustine says (cf. Objection [3]) that "even the weeds of
    mourning may be a subject of ostentation."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly in the first two ways it is praiseworthy to wear humble apparel,
    but in the third way it is sinful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, coarse and homely attire may be considered as the result of
    covetousness or negligence, and thus also it is sinful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Coarseness of attire has not of itself
    the appearance of evil, indeed it has more the appearance of good, namely of
    the contempt of worldly glory. Hence it is that wicked persons hide their
    wickedness under coarse clothing. Hence Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in
    Monte ii, 24) that "the sheep should not dislike their clothing for the
    reason that the wolves sometimes hide themselves under it."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Jerome is speaking there of the coarse
    attire that is worn on account of human glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> According to our Lord's teaching men
    should do no deeds of holiness for the sake of show: and this is especially
    the case when one does something strange. Hence Chrysostom [*Hom. xiii in
    Matth. in the Opus Imperfectum, falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom]
    says: "While praying a man should do nothing strange, so as to draw the gaze
    of others, either by shouting or striking his breast, or casting up his
    hands," because the very strangeness draws people's attention to him. Yet
    blame does not attach to all strange behavior that draws people's attention,
    for it may be done well or ill. Hence Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte
    ii, 12) that "in the practice of the Christian religion when a man draws
    attention to himself by unwonted squalor and shabbiness, since he acts thus
    voluntarily and not of necessity, we can gather from his other deeds whether
    his behavior is motivated by contempt of excessive dress or by affectation."
    Religious, however, would especially seem not to act thus from affectation,
    since they wear a coarse habit as a sign of their profession whereby they
    profess contempt of the world.<br />
