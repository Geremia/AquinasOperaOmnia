</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God cannot be feared. For the object of fear 
is a future evil, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS041.html#FSQ41OUTP1">Question [41]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS041.html#FSQ41ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3). But God is free 
of all evil, since He is goodness itself. Therefore God cannot be feared.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, fear is opposed to hope. Now we hope in God. Therefore 
we cannot fear Him at the same time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as the Philosopher states (Rhet. ii, 5), "we fear those 
things whence evil comes to us." But evil comes to us, not from God, but 
from ourselves, according to Osee 13:9: "Destruction is thy own, O 
Israel: thy help is . . . in Me." Therefore God is not to be feared.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++10:7">Jer. 10:7</a>): "Who shall not fear Thee, O 
King of nations?" and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Malachi+1:6">Malachi 1:6</a>): "If I be a master, where is My fear?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Just as hope has two objects, one of which is the future 
good itself, that one expects to obtain, while the other is someone's 
help, through whom one expects to obtain what one hopes for, so, too, 
fear may have two objects, one of which is the very evil which a man 
shrinks from, while the other is that from which the evil may come. 
Accordingly, in the first way God, Who is goodness itself, cannot be an 
object of fear; but He can be an object of fear in the second way, in so 
far as there may come to us some evil either from Him or in relation to 
Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From Him there comes the evil of punishment, but this is evil not 
absolutely but relatively, and, absolutely speaking, is a good. Because, 
since a thing is said to be good through being ordered to an end, while 
evil implies lack of this order, that which excludes the order to the 
last end is altogether evil, and such is the evil of fault. On the other 
hand the evil of punishment is indeed an evil, in so far as it is the 
privation of some particular good, yet absolutely speaking, it is a good, 
in so far as it is ordained to the last end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to God the evil of fault can come to us, if we be separated 
from Him: and in this way God can and ought to be feared.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This objection considers the object of fear as being the 
evil which a man shuns.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In God, we may consider both His justice, in  respect of 
which He punishes those who sin, and His mercy, in respect of which He 
sets us free: in us the consideration of His justice gives rise to fear, 
but the consideration of His mercy gives rise to hope, so that, 
accordingly, God is the object of both hope and fear, but under different 
aspects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The evil of fault is not from God as its author but from 
us, in for far as we forsake God: while the evil of punishment is from 
God as its author, in so far as it has character of a good, since it is 
something just, through being inflicted on us justly; although originally 
this is due to the demerit of sin: thus it is written (Wis. 1:13,16): 
"God made not death . . . but the wicked with works and words have called 
it to them."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether fear is fittingly divided into filial, initial, servile and worldly fear?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that fear is unfittingly divided into filial, 
initial, servile and worldly fear. For Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 
15) that there are six kinds of fear, viz. "laziness, shamefacedness," 
etc. of which we have treated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS041.html#FSQ41OUTP1">Question [41]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS041.html#FSQ41A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), and which are not 
mentioned in the division in question. Therefore this division of fear 
seems unfitting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, each of these fears is either good or evil. But there is 
a fear, viz. natural fear, which is neither morally good, since it is in 
the demons, according to James 2:19, "The devils . . . believe and 
tremble," nor evil, since it is in Christ, according to Mk. 14:33, Jesus 
"began to fear and be heavy." Therefore the aforesaid division of fear is 
insufficient.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the relation of son to father differs from that of wife 
to husband, and this again from that of servant to master. Now filial 
fear, which is that of the son in comparison with his father, is distinct 
from servile fear, which is that of the servant in comparison with his 
master. Therefore chaste fear, which seems to be that of the wife in 
comparison with her husband, ought to be distinguished from all these 
other fears.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, even as servile fear fears punishment, so do initial and 
worldly fear. Therefore no distinction should be made between them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[2] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, even as concupiscence is about some good, so is fear 
about some evil. Now "concupiscence of the eyes," which is the desire for 
things of this world, is distinct from "concupiscence of the flesh," 
which is the desire for one's own pleasure. Therefore "worldly fear," 
whereby one fears to lose external goods, is distinct from "human fear," 
whereby one fears harm to one's own person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the contrary stands the authority of the Master (Sent. iii, D, 34). 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We are speaking of fear now, in so far as it makes us 
turn, so to speak, to God or away from Him. For, since the object of fear 
is an evil, sometimes, on account of the evils he fears, man withdraws 
from God, and this is called human fear; while sometimes, on account of 
the evils he fears, he turns to God and adheres to Him. This latter evil 
is twofold, viz. evil of punishment, and evil of fault.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly if a man turn to God and adhere to Him, through fear of 
punishment, it will be servile fear; but if it be on account of fear of 
committing a fault, it will be filial fear, for it becomes a child to 
fear offending its father. If, however, it be on account of both, it will 
be initial fear, which is between both these fears. As to whether it is 
possible to fear the evil of fault, the question has been treated above 
(<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS042.html#FSQ42OUTP1">Question [42]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS042.html#FSQ42A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) when we were considering the passion of fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Damascene divides fear as a passion of the soul: whereas 
this division of fear is taken from its relation to God, as explained 
above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Moral good consists chiefly in turning to God, while moral 
evil consists chiefly in turning away from Him: wherefore all the fears 
mentioned above imply either moral evil or moral good. Now natural fear 
is presupposed to moral good and evil, and so it is not numbered among 
these kinds of fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The relation of servant to master is based on the power 
which the master exercises over the servant; whereas, on the contrary, 
the relation of a son to his father or of a wife to her husband is based 
on the son's affection towards his father to whom he submits himself, or 
on the wife's affection towards her husband to whom she binds herself in 
the union of love. Hence filial and chaste fear amount to the same, 
because by the love of charity God becomes our Father, according to Rm. 
8:15, "You have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: 
Abba [Father]"; and by this same charity He is called our spouse, 
according to 2 Cor. 11:2, "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may 
present you as a chaste virgin to Christ": whereas servile fear has no 
connection with these, since it does not include charity in its 
definition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> These three fears regard punishment but in different ways. 
For worldly or human fear regards a punishment which turns man away from 
God, and which God's enemies sometimes inflict or threaten: whereas 
servile and initial fear regard a punishment whereby men are drawn to 
God, and which is inflicted or threatened by God. Servile fear regards 
this punishment chiefly, while initial fear regards it secondarily.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[2] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> It amounts to the same whether man turns away from God 
through fear of losing his worldly goods, or through fear of forfeiting 
the well-being of his body, since external goods  belong to the body. 
Hence both these fears are reckoned as one here, although they fear 
different evils, even as they correspond to the desire of different 
goods. This diversity causes a specific diversity of sins, all of which 
alike however lead man away from God.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether worldly fear is always evil?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that worldly fear is not always evil. Because 
regard for men seems to be a kind of human fear. Now some are blamed for 
having no regard for man, for instance, the unjust judge of whom we read 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++18:2">Lk. 18:2</a>) that he "feared not God, nor regarded man." Therefore it seems 
that worldly fear is not always evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, worldly fear seems to have reference to the punishments 
inflicted by the secular power. Now such like punishments incite us to 
good actions, according to Rm. 13:3, "Wilt thou not be afraid of the 
power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same." 
Therefore worldly fear is not always evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it seems that what is in us naturally, is not evil, 
since our natural gifts are from God. Now it is natural to man to fear 
detriment to his body, and loss of his worldly goods, whereby the present 
life is supported. Therefore it seems that worldly fear is not always 
evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++10:28">Mt. 10:28</a>): "Fear ye not them that kill 
the body," thus forbidding worldly fear. Now nothing but what is evil is 
forbidden by God. Therefore worldly fear is evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As shown above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, 
Question [54], Article [2]) moral acts and habits take their name and species from their 
objects. Now the proper object of the appetite's movement is the final 
good: so that, in consequence, every appetitive movement is both 
specified and named from its proper end. For if anyone were to describe 
covetousness as love of work because men work on account of covetousness, 
this description would be incorrect, since the covetous man seeks work 
not as end but as a means: the end that he seeks is wealth, wherefore 
covetousness is rightly described as the desire or the love of wealth, 
and this is evil. Accordingly worldly love is, properly speaking, the 
love whereby a man trusts in the world as his end, so that worldly love 
is always evil. Now fear is born of love, since man fears the loss of 
what he loves, as Augustine states (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 33). Now worldly 
fear is that which arises from worldly love as from an evil root, for 
which reason worldly fear is always evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> One may have regard for men in two ways. First in so far as 
there is in them something divine, for instance, the good of grace or of 
virtue, or at least of the natural image of God: and in this way those 
are blamed who have no regard for man. Secondly,  one may have regard for 
men as being in opposition to God, and thus it is praiseworthy to have no 
regard for men, according as we read of Elias or Eliseus (Ecclus. 48:13): 
"In his days he feared not the prince."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When the secular power inflicts punishment in order to 
withdraw men from sin, it is acting as God's minister, according to Rm. 
13:4, "For he is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath upon him 
that doth evil." To fear the secular power in this way is part, not of 
worldly fear, but of servile or initial fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is natural for man to shrink from detriment to his own 
body and loss of worldly goods, but to forsake justice on that account is 
contrary to natural reason. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 1) 
that there are certain things, viz. sinful deeds, which no fear should 
drive us to do, since to do such things is worse than to suffer any 
punishment whatever.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether servile fear is good?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that servile fear is not good. For if the use of a 
thing is evil, the thing itself is evil. Now the use of servile fear is 
evil, for according to a gloss on Rm. 8:15, "if a man do anything through 
fear, although the deed be good, it is not well done." Therefore servile 
fear is not good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no good grows from a sinful root. Now servile fear grows 
from a sinful root, because when commenting on Job 3:11, "Why did I not 
die in the womb?" Gregory says (Moral. iv, 25): "When a man dreads the 
punishment which confronts him for his sin and no longer loves the 
friendship of God which he has lost, his fear is born of pride, not of 
humility." Therefore servile fear is evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as mercenary love is opposed to the love of 
charity, so is servile fear, apparently, opposed to chaste fear. But 
mercenary love is always evil. Therefore servile fear is also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Nothing evil is from the Holy Ghost. But servile fear 
is from the Holy Ghost, since a gloss on Rm. 8:15, "You have not received 
the spirit of bondage," etc. says: "It is the one same spirit that 
bestows two fears, viz. servile and chaste fear." Therefore servile fear 
is not evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is owing to its servility that servile fear may be 
evil. For servitude is opposed to freedom. Since, then, "what is free is 
cause of itself" (Metaph. i, 2), a slave is one who does not act as cause 
of his own action, but as though moved from without. Now whoever does a 
thing through love, does it of himself so to speak, because it is by his 
own inclination that he is moved to act: so that it is contrary to the 
very notion of servility that one should act from love. Consequently 
servile fear  as such is contrary to charity: so that if servility were 
essential to fear, servile fear would be evil simply, even as adultery is 
evil simply, because that which makes it contrary to charity belongs to 
its very species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This servility, however, does not belong to the species of servile fear, 
even as neither does lifelessness to the species of lifeless faith. For 
the species of a moral habit or act is taken from the object. Now the 
object of servile fear is punishment, and it is by accident that, either 
the good to which the punishment is contrary, is loved as the last end, 
and that consequently the punishment is feared as the greatest evil, 
which is the case with one who is devoid of charity, or that the 
punishment is directed to God as its end, and that, consequently, it is 
not feared as the greatest evil, which is the case with one who has 
charity. For the species of a habit is not destroyed through its object 
or end being directed to a further end. Consequently servile fear is 
substantially good, but is servility is evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This saying of Augustine is to be applied to a man who does 
something through servile fear as such, so that he loves not justice, and 
fears nothing but the punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Servile fear as to its substance is not born of pride, but 
its servility is, inasmuch as man is unwilling, by love, to subject his 
affections to the yoke of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Mercenary love is that whereby God is loved for the sake of 
worldly goods, and this is, of itself, contrary to charity, so that 
mercenary love is always evil. But servile fear, as to its substance, 
implies merely fear of punishment, whether or not this be feared as the 
principal evil.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether servile fear is substantially the same as filial fear?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that servile fear is substantially the same as 
filial fear. For filial fear is to servile fear the same apparently as 
living faith is to lifeless faith, since the one is accompanied by mortal 
sin and the other not. Now living faith and lifeless faith are 
substantially the same. Therefore servile and filial fear are 
substantially the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, habits are diversified by their objects. Now the same 
thing is the object of servile and of filial fear, since they both fear 
God. Therefore servile and filial fear are substantially the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as man hopes to enjoy God and to obtain favors from 
Him, so does he fear to be separated from God and to be punished by Him. 
Now it is the same hope whereby we hope to enjoy God, and to receive 
other favors from Him, as stated above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>, <A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). Therefore 
filial fear, whereby we fear separation from God, is the same as servile 
fear whereby we fear His punishments. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (In prim. canon. Joan. Tract. ix) says that 
there are two fears, one servile, another filial or chaste fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The proper object of fear is evil. And since acts and 
habits are diversified by their objects, as shown above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54OUTP1">Question [54]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it follows of necessity that different kinds of fear correspond to 
different kinds of evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the evil of punishment, from which servile fear shrinks, differs 
specifically from evil of fault, which filial fear shuns, as shown above 
(<A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Hence it is evident that servile and filial fear are not the same 
substantially but differ specifically.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Living and lifeless faith differ, not as regards the 
object, since each of them believes God and believes in a God, but in 
respect of something extrinsic, viz. the presence or absence of charity, 
and so they do not differ substantially. On the other hand, servile and 
filial fear differ as to their objects: and hence the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Servile fear and filial fear do not regard God in the same 
light. For servile fear looks upon God as the cause of the infliction of 
punishment, whereas filial fear looks upon Him, not as the active cause 
of guilt, but rather as the term wherefrom it shrinks to be separated by 
guilt. Consequently the identity of object, viz. God, does not prove a 
specific identity of fear, since also natural movements differ 
specifically according to their different relationships to some one term, 
for movement from whiteness is not specifically the same as movement 
towards whiteness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Hope looks upon God as the principle not only of the 
enjoyment of God, but also of any other favor whatever. This cannot be 
said of fear; and so there is no comparison.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether servile fear remains with charity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that servile fear does not remain with charity. For 
Augustine says (In prim. canon. Joan. Tract. ix) that "when charity takes 
up its abode, it drives away fear which had prepared a place for it."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "The charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by 
the Holy Ghost, Who is given to us" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++5:5">Rm. 5:5</a>). Now "where the Spirit of 
the Lord is, there is liberty" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</a>). Since then freedom excludes 
servitude, it seems that servile fear is driven away when charity comes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, servile fear is caused by self-love, in so far as 
punishment diminishes one's own good. Now love of God drives away 
self-love, for it makes us despise ourselves: thus Augustine  testifies 
(De Civ. Dei xiv, 28) that "the love of God unto the contempt of self 
builds up the city of God." Therefore it seems that servile fear is 
driven out when charity comes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Servile fear is a gift of the Holy Ghost, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now the gifts of the Holy Ghost are not forfeited through 
the advent of charity, whereby the Holy Ghost dwells in us. Therefore 
servile fear is not driven out when charity comes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[6] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Servile fear proceeds from self-love, because it is fear 
of punishment which is detrimental to one's own good. Hence the fear of 
punishment is consistent with charity, in the same way as self-love is: 
because it comes to the same that a man love his own good and that he 
fear to be deprived of it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[6] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now self-love may stand in a threefold relationship to charity. In one 
way it is contrary to charity, when a man places his end in the love of 
his own good. In another way it is included in charity, when a man loves 
himself for the sake of God and in God. In a third way, it is indeed 
distinct from charity, but is not contrary thereto, as when a man loves 
himself from the point of view of his own good, yet not so as to place 
his end in this his own good: even as one may have another special love 
for one's neighbor, besides the love of charity which is founded on God, 
when we love him by reason of usefulness, consanguinity, or some other 
human consideration, which, however, is referable to charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[6] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly fear of punishment is, in one way, included in charity, 
because separation from God is a punishment, which charity shuns 
exceedingly; so that this belongs to chaste fear. In another way, it is 
contrary to charity, when a man shrinks from the punishment that is 
opposed to his natural good, as being the principal evil in opposition to 
the good which he loves as an end; and in this way fear of punishment is 
not consistent with charity. In another way fear of punishment is indeed 
substantially distinct from chaste fear, when, to wit, a man fears a 
penal evil, not because it separates him from God, but because it is 
hurtful to his own good, and yet he does not place his end in this good, 
so that neither does he dread this evil as being the principal evil. Such 
fear of punishment is consistent with charity; but it is not called 
servile, except when punishment is dreaded as a principal evil, as 
explained above (<A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4). Hence fear considered as servile, does not 
remain with charity, but the substance of servile fear can remain with 
charity, even as self-love can remain with charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine is speaking of fear considered as servile: and 
such is the sense of the two other objections.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether fear is the beginning of wisdom?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that fear is not the beginning of wisdom. For the 
beginning of a thing is a part thereof. But fear is not a  part of 
wisdom, since fear is seated in the appetitive faculty, while wisdom is 
in the intellect. Therefore it seems that fear is not the beginning of 
wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing is the beginning of itself. "Now fear of the 
Lord, that is wisdom," according to Job 28:28. Therefore it seems that 
fear of God is not the beginning of wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing is prior to the beginning. But something is 
prior to fear, since faith precedes fear. Therefore it seems that fear is 
not the beginning of wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written in the Ps. 110:10: "The fear of the Lord 
is the beginning of wisdom."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[7] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing may be called the beginning of wisdom in two 
ways: in one way because it is the beginning of wisdom itself as to its 
essence; in another way, as to its effect. Thus the beginning of an art 
as to its essence consists in the principles from which that art 
proceeds, while the beginning of an art as to its effect is that 
wherefrom it begins to operate: for instance we might say that the 
beginning of the art of building is the foundation because that is where 
the builder begins his work.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[7] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, since wisdom is the knowledge of Divine things, as we shall state 
further on (<A Href="SS045.html#SSQ45OUTP1">Question [45]</a>, <A Href="SS045.html#SSQ45A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it is considered by us in one way, and in 
another way by philosophers. For, seeing that our life is ordained to the 
enjoyment of God, and is directed thereto according to a participation of 
the Divine Nature, conferred on us through grace, wisdom, as we look at 
it, is considered not only as being cognizant of God, as it is with the 
philosophers, but also as directing human conduct; since this is directed 
not only by the human law, but also by the Divine law, as Augustine shows 
(De Trin. xii, 14). Accordingly the beginning of wisdom as to its essence 
consists in the first principles of wisdom, i.e. the articles of faith, 
and in this sense faith is said to be the beginning of wisdom. But as 
regards the effect, the beginning of wisdom is the point where wisdom 
begins to work, and in this way fear is the beginning of wisdom, yet 
servile fear in one way, and filial fear, in another. For servile fear is 
like a principle disposing a man to wisdom from without, in so far as he 
refrains from sin through fear of punishment, and is thus fashioned for 
the effect of wisdom, according to Ecclus. 1:27, "The fear of the Lord 
driveth out sin." On the other hand, chaste or filial fear is the 
beginning of wisdom, as being the first effect of wisdom. For since the 
regulation of human conduct by the Divine law belongs to wisdom, in order 
to make a beginning, man must first of all fear God and submit himself to 
Him: for the result will be that in all things he will be ruled by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument proves that fear is not the beginning of 
wisdom as to the essence of wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The fear of God is compared to a man's whole life  that is 
ruled by God's wisdom, as the root to the tree: hence it is written 
(Ecclus. 1:25): "The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, for [Vulg.: 
'and'] the branches thereof are longlived." Consequently, as the root is 
said to be virtually the tree, so the fear of God is said to be wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above, faith is the beginning of wisdom in one 
way, and fear, in another. Hence it is written (Ecclus. 25:16): "The fear 
of God is the beginning of love: and the beginning of faith is to be fast 
joined to it."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether initial fear differs substantially from filial fear?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that initial fear differs substantially from filial 
fear. For filial fear is caused by love. Now initial fear is the 
beginning of love, according to Ecclus. 25:16, "The fear of God is the 
beginning of love." Therefore initial fear is distinct from filial fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, initial fear dreads punishment, which is the object of 
servile fear, so that initial and servile fear would seem to be the same. 
But servile fear is distinct from filial fear. Therefore initial fear 
also is substantially distinct from initial fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a mean differs in the same ratio from both the extremes. 
Now initial fear is the mean between servile and filial fear. Therefore 
it differs from both filial and servile fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Perfect and imperfect do not diversify the substance of 
a thing. Now initial and filial fear differ in respect of perfection and 
imperfection of charity, as Augustine states (In prim. canon. Joan. 
Tract. ix). Therefore initial fear does not differ substantially from 
filial fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[8] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Initial fear is so called because it is a beginning 
[initium]. Since, however, both servile and filial fear are, in some way, 
the beginning of wisdom, each may be called in some way, initial.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[8] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not in this sense, however, that we are to understand initial fear 
in so far as it is distinct from servile and filial fear, but in the 
sense according to which it belongs to the state of beginners, in whom 
there is a beginning of filial fear resulting from a beginning of 
charity, although they do not possess the perfection of filial fear, 
because they have not yet attained to the perfection of charity. 
Consequently initial fear stands in the same relation to filial fear as 
imperfect to perfect charity. Now perfect and imperfect charity differ, 
not as to essence but as to state. Therefore we must conclude that 
initial fear, as we understand it here, does not differ essentially from 
filial fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The fear which is a beginning of love is servile  fear, 
which is the herald of charity, just as the bristle introduces the 
thread, as Augustine states (Tract. ix in Ep. i Joan.). Or else, if it be 
referred to initial fear, this is said to be the beginning of love, not 
absolutely, but relatively to the state of perfect charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Initial fear does not dread punishment as its proper 
object, but as having something of servile fear connected with it: for 
this servile fear, as to its substance, remains indeed, with charity, its 
servility being cast aside; whereas its act remains with imperfect 
charity in the man who is moved to perform good actions not only through 
love of justice, but also through fear of punishment, though this same 
act ceases in the man who has perfect charity, which "casteth out fear," 
according to 1 Jn. 4:18.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Initial fear is a mean between servile and filial fear, not 
as between two things of the same genus, but as the imperfect is a mean 
between a perfect being and a non-being, as stated in Metaph. ii, for it 
is the same substantially as the perfect being, while it differs 
altogether from non-being.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is proper to a theological virtue to have God for its 
object. But fear has God for its object, in so far as God is feared. 
Therefore fear is not a gift, but a theological virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fear arises from love. But love is reckoned a 
theological virtue. Therefore fear also is a theological virtue, being 
connected with the same matter, as it were.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[9] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. ii, 49) that "fear is bestowed as a 
remedy against pride." But the virtue of humility is opposed to pride. 
Therefore again, fear is a kind of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[9] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the gifts are more perfect than the virtues, since they 
are bestowed in support of the virtues as Gregory says (Moral. ii, 49). 
Now hope is more perfect than fear, since hope regards good, while fear 
regards evil. Since, then, hope is a virtue, it should not be said that 
fear is a gift.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The fear of the Lord is numbered among the seven gifts 
of the Holy Ghost (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++11:3">Is. 11:3</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[9] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Fear is of several kinds, as stated above (<A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).  Now it 
is not "human fear," according to Augustine (De Gratia et Lib. Arb. 
xviii), "that is a gift of God"---for it was by this fear that Peter 
denied Christ---but that fear of which it was said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++10:28">Mt. 10:28</a>): "Fear Him 
that can destroy both soul and body into hell."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[9] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again servile fear is not to be reckoned among the seven gifts of the 
Holy Ghost, though it is from Him, because according to Augustine (De 
Nat. et Grat. lvii) it is compatible with the will to sin: whereas the 
gifts of the Holy Ghost are incompatible with the will to sin, as they 
are inseparable from charity, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[9] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows, therefore, that the fear of God, which is numbered among the 
seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, is filial or chaste fear. For it was 
stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3) that the gifts of the Holy Ghost are 
certain habitual perfections of the soul's powers, whereby these are 
rendered amenable to the motion of the Holy Ghost, just as, by the moral 
virtues, the appetitive powers are rendered amenable to the motion of 
reason. Now for a thing to be amenable to the motion of a certain mover, 
the first condition required is that it be a non-resistant subject of 
that mover, because resistance of the movable subject to the mover 
hinders the movement. This is what filial or chaste fear does, since 
thereby we revere God and avoid separating ourselves from Him. Hence, 
according to Augustine (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4) filial fear holds 
the first place, as it were, among the gifts of the Holy Ghost, in the 
ascending order, and the last place, in the descending order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[9] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Filial fear is not opposed to the virtue of hope: since 
thereby we fear, not that we may fail of what we hope to obtain by God's 
help, but lest we withdraw ourselves from this help. Wherefore filial 
fear and hope cling together, and perfect one another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The proper and principal object of fear is the evil 
shunned, and in this way, as stated above (<A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), God cannot be an object 
of fear. Yet He is, in this way, the object of hope and the other 
theological virtues, since, by the virtue of hope, we trust in God's 
help, not only to obtain any other goods, but, chiefly, to obtain God 
Himself, as the principal good. The same evidently applies to the other 
theological virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> From the fact that love is the origin of fear, it does not 
follow that the fear of God is not a distinct habit from charity which is 
the love of God, since love is the origin of all the emotions, and yet we 
are perfected by different habits in respect of different emotions. Yet 
love is more of a virtue than fear is, because love regards good, to 
which virtue is principally directed by reason of its own nature, as was 
shown above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS055.html#FSQ55ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4); for which reason hope is also reckoned 
as a virtue; whereas fear principally regards evil, the avoidance of 
which it denotes, wherefore it is something less than a theological 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[9] R.O. 4 Para. 1/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> According to Ecclus. 10:14, "the beginning of the pride of 
man is to fall off from God," that is to refuse submission to God, and 
this is opposed to filial fear, which reveres God. Thus fear cuts off the 
source of pride for which reason it is bestowed as a remedy against 
pride. Yet it does not follow that it is the same as the virtue of 
humility, but that it is its origin. For the gifts of the Holy Ghost are 
the origin of the intellectual and moral virtues, as stated above (FS, 
Question [68], Article [4]), while the theological virtues are the origin of the gifts, 
as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS069.html#FSQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS069.html#FSQ69A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[9] R.O. 4 Para. 2/2-->

<H3 Align="Left">Whether fear decreases when charity increases?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that fear decreases when charity increases. For 
Augustine says (In prim. canon. Joan. Tract. ix): "The more charity 
increases, the more fear decreases."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, fear decreases when hope increases. But charity 
increases when hope increases, as stated above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>, <A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Therefore 
fear decreases when charity increases.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, love implies union, whereas fear implies separation. Now 
separation decreases when union increases. Therefore fear decreases when 
the love of charity increases.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 36) that "the fear of 
God not only begins but also perfects wisdom, whereby we love God above 
all things, and our neighbor as ourselves."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[10] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Fear is twofold, as stated above (<A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4); one is filial 
fear, whereby a son fears to offend his father or to be separated from 
him; the other is servile fear, whereby one fears punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[10] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now filial fear must needs increase when charity increases, even as an 
effect increases with the increase of its cause. For the more one loves a 
man, the more one fears to offend him and to be separated from him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[10] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand servile fear, as regards its servility, is entirely 
cast out when charity comes, although the fear of punishment remains as 
to its substance, as stated above (<A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). This fear decreases as charity 
increases, chiefly as regards its act, since the more a man loves God, 
the less he fears punishment; first, because he thinks less of his own 
good, to which punishment is opposed; secondly, because, the faster he 
clings, the more confident he is of the reward, and, consequently the 
less fearful of punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine speaks there of the fear of punishment.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is fear of punishment that decreases when hope 
increases; but with the increase of the latter filial fear increases, 
because the more certainly a man expects to obtain a good by another's 
help, the more he fears to offend him or to be separated from him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[10] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Filial fear does not imply separation from God, but 
submission to Him, and shuns separation from that submission. Yet, in a 
way, it implies separation, in the point of not presuming to equal 
oneself to Him, and of submitting to Him, which separation is to be 
observed even in charity, in so far as a man loves God more than himself 
and more than aught else. Hence the increase of the love of charity 
implies not a decrease but an increase in the reverence of fear.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[11] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that fear does not remain in heaven. For it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++1:33">Prov. 1:33</a>): "He . . . shall enjoy abundance, without fear of 
evils," which is to be understood as referring to those who already enjoy 
wisdom in everlasting happiness. Now every fear is about some evil, since 
evil is the object of fear, as stated above (<A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,5; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS042.html#FSQ42OUTP1">Question [42]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS042.html#FSQ42A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
Therefore there will be no fear in heaven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[11] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in heaven men will be conformed to God, according to 1 
Jn. 3:2, "When He shall appear, we shall be like to Him." But God fears 
nothing. Therefore, in heaven, men will have no fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[11] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, hope is more perfect than fear, since hope regards good, 
and fear, evil. Now hope will not be in heaven. Therefore neither will 
there be fear in heaven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[11] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++18:10">Ps. 18:10</a>): "The fear of the Lord is 
holy, enduring for ever and ever."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[11] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Servile fear, or fear of punishment, will by no means be 
in heaven, since such a fear is excluded by the security which is 
essential to everlasting happiness, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS005.html#FSQ5OUTP1">Question [5]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS005.html#FSQ5A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[11] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But regard to filial fear, as it increases with the increase of charity, 
so is it perfected when charity is made perfect; hence, in heaven, it 
will not have quite the same act as it has now.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[11] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to make this clear, we must observe that the proper object of 
fear is a possible evil, just as the proper object of hope is a possible 
good: and since the movement of fear is like one of avoidance, fear 
implies avoidance of a possible arduous evil, for little evils inspire no 
fear. Now as a thing's good consists in its staying in its own order, so 
a thing's evil consists in forsaking its order. Again, the order of a 
rational creature is  that it should be under God and above other 
creatures. Hence, just as it is an evil for a rational creature to 
submit, by love, to a lower creature, so too is it an evil for it, if it 
submit not to God, by presumptuously revolt against Him or contemn Him. 
Now this evil is possible to a rational creature considered as to its 
nature on account of the natural flexibility of the free-will; whereas in 
the blessed, it becomes impossible, by reason of the perfection of glory. 
Therefore the avoidance of this evil that consists in non-subjection to 
God, and is possible to nature, but impossible in the state of bliss, 
will be in heaven; while in this life there is avoidance of this evil as 
of something altogether possible. Hence Gregory, expounding the words of 
Job (26:11), "The pillars of heaven tremble, and dread at His beck," says 
(Moral. xvii, 29): "The heavenly powers that gaze on Him without ceasing, 
tremble while contemplating: but their awe, lest it should be of a penal 
nature, is one not of fear but of wonder," because, to wit, they wonder 
at God's supereminence and incomprehensibility. Augustine also (De Civ. 
Dei xiv, 9) in this sense, admits fear in heaven, although he leaves the 
question doubtful. "If," he says, "this chaste fear that endureth for 
ever and ever is to be in the future life, it will not be a fear that is 
afraid of an evil which might possibly occur, but a fear that holds fast 
to a good which we cannot lose. For when we love the good which we have 
acquired, with an unchangeable love, without doubt, if it is allowable to 
say so, our fear is sure of avoiding evil. Because chaste fear denotes a 
will that cannot consent to sin, and whereby we avoid sin without 
trembling lest, in our weakness, we fall, and possess ourselves in the 
tranquillity born of charity. Else, if no kind of fear is possible there, 
perhaps fear is said to endure for ever and ever, because that which fear 
will lead us to, will be everlasting."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[11] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The passage quoted excludes from the blessed, the fear that 
denotes solicitude, and anxiety about evil, but not the fear which is 
accompanied by security.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[11] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ix) "the same things are both 
like and unlike God. They are like by reason of a variable imitation of 
the Inimitable"---that is, because, so far as they can, they imitate God 
Who cannot be imitated perfectly---"they are unlike because they are the 
effects of a Cause of Whom they fall short infinitely and immeasurably." 
Hence, if there be no fear in God (since there is none above Him to whom 
He may be subject) it does not follow that there is none in the blessed, 
whose happiness consists in perfect subjection to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[11] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Hope implies a certain defect, namely the futurity of 
happiness, which ceases when happiness is present: whereas fear implies a 
natural defect in a creature, in so far as it is infinitely distant from 
God, and this defect will remain even in heaven. Hence fear will not be 
cast out altogether.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether poverty of spirit is the beatitude corresponding to the gift of fear? <br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[12] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that poverty of spirit is not the beatitude 
corresponding to the gift of fear. For fear is the beginning of the 
spiritual life, as explained above (<A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>): whereas poverty belongs to the 
perfection of the spiritual life, according to Mt. 19:21, "If thou wilt 
be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor." Therefore 
poverty of spirit does not correspond to the gift of fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[12] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++118:120">Ps. 118:120</a>): "Pierce Thou my flesh with 
Thy fear," whence it seems to follow that it belongs to fear to restrain 
the flesh. But the curbing of the flesh seems to belong rather to the 
beatitude of mourning. Therefore the beatitude of mourning corresponds to 
the gift of fear, rather than the beatitude of poverty.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[12] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the gift of fear corresponds to the virtue of hope, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>, ad 1). Now the last beatitude which is, "Blessed are 
the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God," seems 
above all to correspond to hope, because according to Rm. 5:2, "we . . . 
glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God." Therefore that 
beatitude corresponds to the gift of fear, rather than poverty of spirit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[12] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it was stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS070.html#FSQ70OUTP1">Question [70]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS070.html#FSQ70A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) that the fruits 
correspond to the beatitudes. Now none of the fruits correspond to the 
gift of fear. Neither, therefore, does any of the beatitudes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[12] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4): "The fear 
of the Lord is befitting the humble of whom it is said: Blessed are the 
poor in spirit."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[12] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Poverty of spirit properly corresponds to fear. Because, 
since it belongs to filial fear to show reverence and submission to God, 
whatever results from this submission belongs to the gift of fear. Now 
from the very fact that a man submits to God, it follows that he ceases 
to seek greatness either in himself or in another but seeks it only in 
God. For that would be inconsistent with perfect subjection to God, 
wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++19:8">Ps. 19:8</a>): "Some trust in chariots and some in 
horses; but we will call upon the name of . . . our God." It follows that 
if a man fear God perfectly, he does not, by pride, seek greatness either 
in himself or in external goods, viz. honors and riches. In either case, 
this proceeds from poverty of spirit, in so far as the latter denotes 
either the voiding of a puffed up and proud spirit, according to 
Augustine's interpretation (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4), or the 
renunciation of worldly goods which is done in spirit, i.e. by one's own 
will, through the instigation of the Holy Spirit, according to the 
expounding of Ambrose on Lk. 6:20 and Jerome on Mt. 5:3.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[12] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since a beatitude is an act of perfect virtue, all the 
beatitudes belong to the perfection of spiritual life. And  this 
perfection seems to require that whoever would strive to obtain a perfect 
share of spiritual goods, needs to begin by despising earthly goods, 
wherefore fear holds the first place among the gifts. Perfection, 
however, does not consist in the renunciation itself of temporal goods; 
since this is the way to perfection: whereas filial fear, to which the 
beatitude of poverty corresponds, is consistent with the perfection of 
wisdom, as stated above (<A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19ATHEP1">Articles [7]</a>,10).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[19] A[12] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The undue exaltation of man either in himself or in another 
is more directly opposed to that submission to God which is the result of 
filial fear, than is external pleasure. Yet this is, in consequence, 
opposed to fear, since whoever fears God and is subject to Him, takes no 
delight in things other than God. Nevertheless, pleasure is not 
concerned, as exaltation is, with the arduous character of a thing which 
fear regards: and so the beatitude of poverty corresponds to fear 
directly, and the beatitude of mourning, consequently.<br>
