<H3 Align="Center">OF THE GRATUITOUS GRACE CONSISTING IN WORDS (TWO ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the gratuitous grace that attaches to words; of 
which the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++12%3A8">1 Cor. 12:8</a>): "To one . . . by the Spirit is 
given the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge." Under 
this head there are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS177.html#SSQ177A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether any gratuitous grace attaches to words?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS177.html#SSQ177A2THEP1">(2)</a> To whom is the grace becoming?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a gratuitous grace does not attach to words. 
For grace is given for that which surpasses the faculty of nature. But 
natural reason has devised the art of rhetoric whereby a man is able to 
speak so as to teach, please, and persuade, as Augustine says (De Doctr. 
Christ. iv, 12). Now this belongs to the grace of words. Therefore it 
would seem that the grace of words is not a gratuitous grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, all grace pertains to the kingdom of God. But the 
Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++4%3A20">1 Cor. 4:20</a>): "The kingdom of God is not in speech, but in 
power." Therefore there is no gratuitous grace connected with words.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no grace is given through merit, since "if by grace, it 
is not now of works" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++11%3A6">Rm. 11:6</a>). But the word is sometimes given to a man 
on his merits. For Gregory says (Moral. xi, 15) in explanation of Ps. 
118:43, "Take not Thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth" that 
"the word of truth is that which Almighty God gives to them that do it, 
and takes away from them that do it not." Therefore it would seem that 
the gift of the word is not a gratuitous grace. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it behooves man to declare in words things pertaining to 
the virtue of faith, no less than those pertaining to the gift of wisdom 
or of knowledge. Therefore if the word of wisdom and the word of 
knowledge are reckoned gratuitous graces, the word of faith should 
likewise be placed among the gratuitous graces.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 6:5): "A gracious tongue in a 
good man shall abound [Vulg.: 'aboundeth']." Now man's goodness is by 
grace. Therefore graciousness in words is also by grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The gratuitous graces are given for the profit of others, 
as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS111.html#FSQ111OUTP1">Question [111]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS111.html#FSQ111ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4). Now the knowledge a man receives 
from God cannot be turned to another's profit, except by means of speech. 
And since the Holy Ghost does not fail in anything that pertains to the 
profit of the Church, He provides also the members of the Church with 
speech; to the effect that a man not only speaks so as to be understood 
by different people, which pertains to the gift of tongues, but also 
speaks with effect, and this pertains to the grace "of the word."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This happens in three ways. First, in order to instruct the intellect, 
and this is the case when a man speaks so as "to teach." Secondly, in 
order to move the affections, so that a man willingly hearkens to the 
word of God. This is the case when a man speaks so as "to please" his 
hearers, not indeed with a view to his own favor, but in order to draw 
them to listen to God's word. Thirdly, in order that men may love that 
which is signified by the word, and desire to fulfill it, and this is the 
case when a man so speaks as "to sway" his hearers. In order to effect 
this the Holy Ghost makes use of the human tongue as of an instrument; 
but He it is Who perfects the work within. Hence Gregory says in a homily 
for Pentecost (Hom. xxx in Ev.): "Unless the Holy Ghost fill the hearts 
of the hearers, in vain does the voice of the teacher resound in the ears 
of the body."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Even as by a miracle God sometimes works in a more 
excellent way those things which nature also can work, so too the Holy 
Ghost effects more excellently by the grace of words that which art can 
effect in a less efficient manner.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Apostle is speaking there of the word that relies on 
human eloquence without the power of the Holy Ghost. Wherefore he says 
just before (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++4%3A19">1 Cor. 4:19</a>): "I . . . will know, not the speech of them 
that are puffed up, but the power": and of himself he had already said (1 
Cor. 2:4): "My speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of 
human wisdom, but in the showing of the spirit and power."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above, the grace of the word is given to a man 
for the profit of others. Hence it is withdrawn sometimes through the 
fault of the hearer, and sometimes through the fault of the speaker. The 
good works of either of them do not merit this  grace directly, but only 
remove the obstacles thereto. For sanctifying grace also is withdrawn on 
account of a person's fault, and yet he does not merit it by his good 
works, which, however, remove the obstacles to grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As stated above, the grace of the word is directed to the 
profit of others. Now if a man communicates his faith to others this is 
by the word of knowledge or of wisdom. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. 
xiv, 1) that "to know how faith may profit the godly and be defended 
against the ungodly, is apparently what the Apostle means by knowledge." 
Hence it was not necessary for him to mention the word of faith, but it 
was sufficient for him to mention the word of knowledge and of wisdom.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the grace of the word of wisdom and knowledge is becoming to women?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the grace of the word of wisdom and knowledge 
is becoming even to women. For teaching is pertinent to this grace, as 
stated in the foregoing Article. Now it is becoming to a woman to teach; 
for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++4%3A3,4">Prov. 4:3,4</a>): "I was an only son in the sight of my 
mother, and she taught me [*Vulg.: 'I was my father's son, tender, and as 
an only son in the sight of my mother. And he taught me.']." Therefore 
this grace is becoming to women.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the grace of prophecy is greater than the grace of the 
word, even as the contemplation of truth is greater than its utterance. 
But prophecy is granted to women, as we read of Deborah (Judges 4:4), and 
of Holda the prophetess, the wife of Sellum (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Kgs++22%3A14">4 Kgs. 22:14</a>), and of the 
four daughters of Philip (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+21%3A9">Acts 21:9</a>). Moreover the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++11%3A5">1 Cor. 11:5</a>): "Every woman praying or prophesying," etc. Much more therefore 
would it seem that the grace of the word is becoming to a woman.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Pt++4%3A10">1 Pt. 4:10</a>): "As every man hath received 
grace ministering the same one to another." Now some women receive the 
grace of wisdom and knowledge, which they cannot minister to others 
except by the grace of the word. Therefore the grace of the word is 
becoming to women.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++14%3A34">1 Cor. 14:34</a>): "Let women keep 
silence in the churches," and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++2%3A12">1 Tim. 2:12</a>): "I suffer not a woman to 
teach." Now this pertains especially to the grace of the word. Therefore 
the grace of the word is not becoming to women.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Speech may be employed in two ways: in one way privately, 
to one or a few, in familiar conversation, and in this respect the grace 
of the word may be becoming to women; in another way, publicly, 
addressing oneself to the whole church, and this is not permitted to 
women. First and chiefly, on account of the condition attaching to the 
female sex, whereby woman should be subject to man, as appears from Gn. 
3:16. Now teaching and  persuading publicly in the church belong not to 
subjects but to the prelates (although men who are subjects may do these 
things if they be so commissioned, because their subjection is not a 
result of their natural sex, as it is with women, but of some thing 
supervening by accident). Secondly, lest men's minds be enticed to lust, 
for it is written (Ecclus. 9:11): "Her conversation burneth as fire." 
Thirdly, because as a rule women are not perfected in wisdom, so as to be 
fit to be intrusted with public teaching.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The passage quoted speaks of private teaching whereby a 
father instructs his son.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The grace of prophecy consists in God enlightening the 
mind, on the part of which there is no difference of sex among men, 
according to Col. 3:10,11, "Putting on the new" man, "him who is renewed 
unto knowledge, according to the image of Him that created him, where 
there is neither male nor female [*Vulg.: 'Neither Gentile nor Jew, 
circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free.' 
Cf. FP, Question [93], Article [6], ad 2 footnote]." Now the grace of the word pertains 
to the instruction of men among whom the difference of sex is found. 
Hence the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[177] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The recipients of a divinely conferred grace administer it 
in different ways according to their various conditions. Hence women, if 
they have the grace of wisdom or of knowledge, can administer it by 
teaching privately but not publicly.<br>
