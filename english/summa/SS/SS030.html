    OF MERCY (FOUR ARTICLES) [*The one Latin word "misericordia" signifies
    either pity or mercy. The distinction between these two is that pity may
    stand either for the act or for the virtue, whereas mercy stands only for
    the virtue.]<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now go on to consider Mercy, under which head there are four points
    of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS030.html#SSQ30A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether evil is the cause of mercy
    on the part of the person pitied?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS030.html#SSQ30A2THEP1">(2)</a> To whom does it belong to pity?
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS030.html#SSQ30A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether mercy is a virtue?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS030.html#SSQ30A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is the greatest of
    virtues?

  <h3 align="left">Whether evil is properly the motive of mercy?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that, properly speaking, evil is
    not the motive of mercy. For, as shown above (<a
      href="SS019.html#SSQ19OUTP1"
      >Question [19]</a
    >, <a href="SS019.html#SSQ19A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;

    <a href="../FP.html">FP</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP048.html#FPQ48OUTP1">Question [48]</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP048.html#FPQ48A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), fault is an evil
    rather than punishment. Now fault provokes indignation rather than mercy.
    Therefore evil does not excite mercy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, cruelty and harshness seem to excel
    other evils. Now the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "harshness does not
    call for pity but drives it away." Therefore evil, as such, is not the
    motive of mercy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, signs of evils are not true evils. But
    signs of evils excite one to mercy, as the Philosopher states (Rhet. ii, 8).
    Therefore evil, properly speaking, is not an incentive to mercy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 2) that
    mercy is a kind of sorrow. Now evil is the motive of sorrow. Therefore it is
    the motive of mercy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5), mercy is
    heartfelt sympathy for another's distress, impelling us to succor him if we
    can. For mercy takes its name "misericordia" from denoting a man's
    compassionate heart [miserum cor] for another's unhappiness. Now unhappiness
    is opposed to happiness: and it is essential to beatitude or happiness that
    one should obtain what one wishes; for, according to Augustine (De Trin.
    xiii, 5), "happy is he who has whatever he desires, and desires nothing
    amiss." Hence, on the other hand, it belongs to unhappiness that a man
    should suffer what he wishes not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now a man wishes a thing in three ways: first, by his natural appetite; thus
    all men naturally wish to be and to live: secondly, a man wishes a thing
    from deliberate choice: thirdly, a man wishes a thing, not in itself, but in
    its cause, thus, if a man wishes to eat what is bad for him, we say that, in
    a way, he wishes to be ill.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly the motive of "mercy," being something pertaining to "misery,"
    is, in the first way, anything contrary to the will's natural appetite,
    namely corruptive or distressing evils, the contrary of which man desires
    naturally, wherefore the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "pity is sorrow
    for a visible evil, whether corruptive or distressing." Secondly, such like
    evils are yet more provocative of pity if they are contrary to deliberate
    choice, wherefore the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 8) that evil excites our
    pity "when it is the result of an accident, as when something turns out ill,
    whereas we hoped well of it." Thirdly, they cause yet greater pity, if they
    are entirely contrary to the will, as when evil befalls a man who has always
    striven to do well: wherefore the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "we
    pity most the distress of one who suffers undeservedly."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is essential to fault that it be
    voluntary; and in this respect it deserves punishment rather than mercy.
    Since, however, fault may be, in a way, a punishment, through having
    something connected with it that is against the sinner's will, it may, in
    this respect, call for mercy. It is in this sense that we pity and
    commiserate sinners. Thus Gregory says in a homily (Hom. in Evang. xxxiv)
    that "true godliness is not disdainful but compassionate," and again it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++9%3A36"
      >Mt. 9:36</a
    >) that Jesus "seeing the multitudes, had compassion on them: because they
    were distressed, and lying like sheep that have no shepherd."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since pity is sympathy for another's
    distress, it is directed, properly speaking, towards another, and not to
    oneself, except figuratively, like justice, according as a man is considered
    to have various parts (Ethic. v, 11). Thus it is written (Ecclus. 30:24):
    "Have pity on thy own soul, pleasing God" [*Cf. Question [106], Article [3],
    ad 1].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly just as, properly speaking, a man does not pity himself, but
    suffers in himself, as when we suffer cruel treatment in ourselves, so too,
    in the case of those who are so closely united to us, as to be part of
    ourselves, such as our children or our parents, we do not pity their
    distress, but suffer as for our own sores; in which sense the Philosopher
    says that "harshness drives pity away."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as pleasure results from hope and
    memory of good things, so does sorrow arise from the prospect or the
    recollection of evil things; though not so keenly as when they are present
    to the senses. Hence the signs of evil move us to pity, in so far as they
    represent as present, the evil that excites our pity.<br />

    Whether the reason for taking pity is a defect in the person who pities?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the reason for taking pity is
    not a defect in the person who takes pity. For it is proper to God to be
    merciful, wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++144%3A9"
      >Ps. 144:9</a
    >): "His tender mercies are over all His works." But there is no defect in
    God. Therefore a defect cannot be the reason for taking pity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if a defect is the reason for taking
    pity, those in whom there is most defect, must needs take most pity. But
    this is false: for the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "those who are in
    a desperate state are pitiless." Therefore it seems that the reason for
    taking pity is not a defect in the person who pities.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to be treated with contempt is to be
    defective. But the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "those who are
    disposed to contumely are pitiless." Therefore the reason for taking pity,
    is not a defect in the person who pities.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Pity is a kind of sorrow. But a defect is the
    reason of sorrow, wherefore those who are in bad health give way to sorrow
    more easily, as we shall say further on (<a
      href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/summa/SS/SS035.html#SSQ35OUTP1"
      >Question [35]</a
    >,
    <a
      href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/summa/SS/SS035.html#SSQ35A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 2). Therefore the reason why one takes pity is a defect in oneself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since pity is grief for another's distress, as
    stated above (<a href="SS030.html#SSQ30A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), from the
    very fact that a person takes pity on anyone, it follows that another's
    distress grieves him. And since sorrow or grief is about one's own ills, one
    grieves or sorrows for another's distress, in so far as one looks upon
    another's distress as one's own.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now this happens in two ways: first, through union of the affections, which
    is the effect of love. For, since he who loves another looks upon his friend
    as another self, he counts his friend's hurt as his own, so that he grieves
    for his friend's hurt as though he were hurt himself. Hence the Philosopher
    (Ethic. ix, 4) reckons "grieving with one's friend" as being one of the
    signs of friendship, and the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++12%3A15"
      >Rm. 12:15</a
    >): "Rejoice with them that rejoice, weep with them that weep."
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, it happens through real union, for instance when another's evil
    comes near to us, so as to pass to us from him. Hence the Philosopher says
    (Rhet. ii, 8) that men pity such as are akin to them, and the like, because
    it makes them realize that the same may happen to themselves. This also
    explains why the old and the wise who consider that they may fall upon evil
    times, as also feeble and timorous persons, are more inclined to pity:
    whereas those who deem themselves happy, and so far powerful as to think
    themselves in no danger of suffering any hurt, are not so inclined to
    pity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly a defect is always the reason for taking pity, either because
    one looks upon another's defect as one's own, through being united to him by
    love, or on account of the possibility of suffering in the same way.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God takes pity on us through love alone,
    in as much as He loves us as belonging to Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those who are already in infinite
    distress, do not fear to suffer more, wherefore they are without pity. In
    like manner this applies to those also who are in great fear, for they are
    so intent on their own passion, that they pay no attention to the suffering
    of others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who are disposed to contumely,
    whether through having been contemned, or because they wish to contemn
    others, are incited to anger and daring, which are manly passions and arouse
    the human spirit to attempt difficult things. Hence they make a man think
    that he is going to suffer something in the future, so that while they are
    disposed in that way they are pitiless, according to Prov. 27:4: "Anger hath
    no mercy, nor fury when it breaketh forth." For the same reason the proud
    are without pity, because they despise others, and think them wicked, so
    that they
