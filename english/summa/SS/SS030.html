<H3 Align="Center">OF MERCY (FOUR ARTICLES) [*The one Latin word "misericordia" signifies either pity or mercy. The distinction between these two is that pity may stand either for the act or for the virtue, whereas mercy stands only for the virtue.]<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now go on to consider Mercy, under which head there are four 
points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS030.html#SSQ30A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether evil is the cause of mercy on the part of the person pitied?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS030.html#SSQ30A2THEP1">(2)</a> To whom does it belong to pity?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS030.html#SSQ30A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether mercy is a virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS030.html#SSQ30A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is the greatest of virtues?

<H3 Align="Left">Whether evil is properly the motive of mercy?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that, properly speaking, evil is not the motive of 
mercy. For, as shown above (<A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS079.html#FSQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS079.html#FSQ79A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 4; <A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP048.html#FPQ48OUTP1">Question [48]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP048.html#FPQ48A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), fault is an evil rather than punishment. Now fault provokes 
indignation rather than mercy. Therefore evil does not excite mercy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, cruelty and harshness seem to excel other evils. Now the 
Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "harshness does not call for pity but 
drives it away." Therefore evil, as such, is not the motive of mercy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, signs of evils are not true evils. But signs of evils 
excite one to mercy, as the Philosopher states (Rhet. ii, 8). Therefore 
evil, properly speaking, is not an incentive to mercy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 2) that mercy is a 
kind of sorrow. Now evil is the motive of sorrow. Therefore it is the 
motive of mercy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5), mercy is heartfelt 
sympathy for another's distress, impelling us to succor him if we can. 
For mercy takes its name "misericordia" from denoting a man's 
compassionate heart [miserum cor] for another's unhappiness. Now 
unhappiness is opposed to happiness: and it is essential to beatitude or 
happiness that one should obtain what one wishes; for, according to 
Augustine (De Trin. xiii, 5), "happy is he who has whatever he desires, 
and desires nothing amiss." Hence, on the other hand, it belongs to 
unhappiness that a man should suffer what he wishes not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now a man wishes a thing in three ways: first, by his natural appetite; 
thus all men naturally wish to be and to live: secondly, a man wishes a 
thing from deliberate choice: thirdly, a man wishes a thing, not in 
itself, but in its cause, thus, if a man wishes to eat what is bad for 
him, we say that, in a way, he wishes to be ill.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly the motive of "mercy," being something pertaining to 
"misery," is, in the first way, anything contrary to the will's natural 
appetite, namely corruptive or distressing evils, the contrary of which 
man desires naturally, wherefore the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 8) that 
"pity is sorrow for a visible evil, whether corruptive or distressing." 
Secondly, such like evils are yet more provocative of pity if they are 
contrary to deliberate choice, wherefore the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 
8) that evil excites our pity "when it is the result of an accident, as 
when something turns out ill, whereas we hoped well of it." Thirdly, they 
cause yet greater pity, if they are entirely contrary to the will, as 
when evil befalls a man who has always striven to do well: wherefore the 
Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "we pity most the distress of one who 
suffers undeservedly."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is essential to fault that it be voluntary;  and in this 
respect it deserves punishment rather than mercy. Since, however, fault 
may be, in a way, a punishment, through having something connected with 
it that is against the sinner's will, it may, in this respect, call for 
mercy. It is in this sense that we pity and commiserate sinners. Thus 
Gregory says in a homily (Hom. in Evang. xxxiv) that "true godliness is 
not disdainful but compassionate," and again it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++9%3A36">Mt. 9:36</a>) 
that Jesus "seeing the multitudes, had compassion on them: because they 
were distressed, and lying like sheep that have no shepherd."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since pity is sympathy for another's distress, it is 
directed, properly speaking, towards another, and not to oneself, except 
figuratively, like justice, according as a man is considered to have 
various parts (Ethic. v, 11). Thus it is written (Ecclus. 30:24): "Have 
pity on thy own soul, pleasing God" [*Cf. Question [106], Article [3], ad 1].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly just as, properly speaking, a man does not pity himself, but 
suffers in himself, as when we suffer cruel treatment in ourselves, so 
too, in the case of those who are so closely united to us, as to be part 
of ourselves, such as our children or our parents, we do not pity their 
distress, but suffer as for our own sores; in which sense the Philosopher 
says that "harshness drives pity away."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as pleasure results from hope and memory of good 
things, so does sorrow arise from the prospect or the recollection of 
evil things; though not so keenly as when they are present to the senses. 
Hence the signs of evil move us to pity, in so far as they represent as 
present, the evil that excites our pity.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the reason for taking pity is a defect in the person who pities?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the reason for taking pity is not a defect in 
the person who takes pity. For it is proper to God to be merciful, 
wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++144%3A9">Ps. 144:9</a>): "His tender mercies are over all His 
works." But there is no defect in God. Therefore a defect cannot be the 
reason for taking pity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if a defect is the reason for taking pity, those in whom 
there is most defect, must needs take most pity. But this is false: for 
the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "those who are in a desperate 
state are pitiless." Therefore it seems that the reason for taking pity 
is not a defect in the person who pities.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to be treated with contempt is to be defective. But the 
Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 8) that "those who are disposed to contumely 
are pitiless." Therefore the reason for taking pity, is not a defect in 
the person who pities.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Pity is a kind of sorrow. But a defect is the reason of 
sorrow, wherefore those who are in bad health give way to sorrow more 
easily, as we shall say further on (<A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS035.html#SSQ35OUTP1">Question [35]</a>, <A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS035.html#SSQ35A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2). Therefore the 
reason why one takes pity is a defect in oneself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[2] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since pity is grief for another's distress, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS030.html#SSQ30A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), from the very fact that a person takes pity on anyone, it 
follows that another's distress grieves him. And since sorrow or grief is 
about one's own ills, one grieves or sorrows for another's distress, in 
so far as one looks upon another's distress as one's own.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[2] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this happens in two ways: first, through union of the affections, 
which is the effect of love. For, since he who loves another looks upon 
his friend as another self, he counts his friend's hurt as his own, so 
that he grieves for his friend's hurt as though he were hurt himself. 
Hence the Philosopher (Ethic. ix, 4) reckons "grieving with one's friend" 
as being one of the signs of friendship, and the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++12%3A15">Rm. 12:15</a>): "Rejoice with them that rejoice, weep with them that weep."
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[2] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it happens through real union, for instance when another's 
evil comes near to us, so as to pass to us from him. Hence the 
Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 8) that men pity such as are akin to them, 
and the like, because it makes them realize that the same may happen to 
themselves. This also explains why the old and the wise who consider that 
they may fall upon evil times, as also feeble and timorous persons, are 
more inclined to pity: whereas those who deem themselves happy, and so 
far powerful as to think themselves in no danger of suffering any hurt, 
are not so inclined to pity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[2] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly a defect is always the reason for taking pity, either 
because one looks upon another's defect as one's own, through being 
united to him by love, or on account of the possibility of suffering in 
the same way.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God takes pity on us through love alone, in as much as He 
loves us as belonging to Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those who are already in infinite distress, do not fear to 
suffer more, wherefore they are without pity. In like manner this applies 
to those also who are in great fear, for they are so intent on their own 
passion, that they pay no attention to the suffering of others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[30] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who are disposed to contumely, whether through having 
been contemned, or because they wish to contemn others, are incited to 
anger and daring, which are manly passions and arouse the human spirit to 
attempt difficult things. Hence they make a man think that he is going to 
suffer something in the future, so that while they are disposed in that 
way they are pitiless, according to Prov. 27:4: "Anger hath no mercy, nor 
fury when it breaketh forth." For the same reason the proud are without  
pity, because they despise others, and think them wicked, so that they
