    TREATISE ON THE STATES OF LIFE (Questions [183]-189)<br />
    <br />
    OF MAN'S VARIOUS DUTIES AND STATES IN GENERAL (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must next consider man's various states and duties. We shall consider (1)
    man's duties and states in general; (2) the state of the perfect in
    particular.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS183.html#SSQ183A1THEP1">(1)</a> What constitutes a state among
    men?
  </p>
  <p>

    various states and duties?
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS183.html#SSQ183A3THEP1">(3)</a> Of the diversity of duties;</p>
  <p><a href="SS183.html#SSQ183A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of the diversity of states.</p>

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the notion of a state denotes a condition of freedom or
    servitude?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the notion of a state does not
    denote a condition of freedom or servitude. For "state" takes its name from
    "standing." Now a person is said to stand on account of his being upright;
    and Gregory says (Moral. vii, 17): "To fall by speaking harmful words is to
    forfeit entirely the state of righteousness." But a man acquires spiritual
    uprightness by submitting his will to God; wherefore a gloss on Ps. 32:1,
    "Praise becometh the upright," says: "The upright are those who direct their
    heart according to God's will." Therefore it would seem that obedience to
    the Divine commandments suffices alone for the notion of a state.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the word "state" seems to denote
    immobility according to 1 Cor. 15:48, "Be ye steadfast [stabiles] and
    immovable"; wherefore Gregory says (Hom. xxi in Ezech.): "The stone is
    foursquare, and is stable on all sides, if no disturbance will make it
    fall." Now it is virtue that enables us "to act with immobility," according
    to Ethic. ii, 4. Therefore it would seem that a state is acquired by every
    virtuous action.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the word "state" seems to indicate
    height of a kind; because to stand is to be raised upwards. Now one man is
    made higher than another by various duties; and in like manner men are
    raised upwards in various ways by various grades and orders. Therefore the
    mere difference of grades, orders, or duties suffices for a difference of
    states.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is thus laid down in the Decretals (II,
    qu. vi, can. Si Quando): "Whenever anyone intervene in a cause where life or
    state is at stake he must do so, not by a proxy, but in his own person"; and
    "state" here has reference to freedom or servitude. Therefore it would seem
    that nothing differentiates a man's state, except that which refers to
    freedom or servitude.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> "State," properly speaking, denotes a kind of
    position, whereby a thing is disposed with a certain immobility in a manner
    according with its nature. For it is natural to man that his head should be
    directed upwards, his feet set firmly on the ground, and his other
    intermediate members disposed in becoming order; and this is not the case if
    he lie down, sit, or recline, but only when he stands upright: nor again is
    he said to stand, if he move, but only when he is still. Hence it is again
    that even in human acts, a matter is said to have stability [statum] in
    reference to its own disposition in the point of a certain immobility or
    restfulness. Consequently matters which easily change and are extrinsic to
    them do not constitute a state among men, for instance that a man be rich or
    poor, of high or low rank, and so forth. Wherefore in the civil law [*Dig.
    I, IX, De Senatoribus] (Lib. Cassius ff. De Senatoribus) it is said that if
    a man be removed from the senate, he is deprived of his dignity rather than
    of his state. But that alone seemingly pertains to a man's state, which
    regards an obligation binding his person, in so far, to wit, as a man is his
    own master or subject to another, not indeed from any slight or unstable
    cause, but from one that is firmly established; and this is something
    pertaining to the nature of freedom or servitude. Therefore state properly
    regards freedom or servitude whether in spiritual or in civil matters.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Uprightness as such does not pertain to
    the notion of state, except in so far as it is connatural to man with the
    addition of a certain restfulness. Hence other animals are said to stand
    without its being required that they should be upright; nor again are men
    said to stand, however upright their position be, unless they be still.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Immobility does not suffice for the
    notion of state; since even one who sits or lies down is still, and yet he
    is not said to stand.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Duty implies relation to act; while
    grades denote an order of superiority and inferiority. But state requires
    immobility in that which regards a condition of the person himself.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether there should be different duties or states in the Church?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there should not be different
    duties or states in the Church. For distinction is opposed to unity. Now the
    faithful of Christ are called to unity according to Jn. 17:21,22: "That
    they... may be one in Us... as We also are one." Therefore there should not
    be a distinction of duties and states in the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nature does not employ many means where
    one suffices. But the working of grace is much more orderly than the working
    of nature. Therefore it were more fitting for things pertaining to the
    operations of grace to be administered by the same persons, so that there
    would not be a distinction of duties and states in the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the good of the Church seemingly
    consists chiefly in peace, according to Ps. 147:3, "Who hath placed peace in
    thy borders," and 2 Cor. 13:11, "Have peace, and the God of peace... shall
    be with you." Now distinction is a hindrance to peace, for peace would seem
    to result from likeness, according to Ecclus. 13:19, "Every beast loveth its
    like," while the Philosopher says (Polit. vii, 5) that "a little difference
    causes dissension in a state." Therefore it would seem that there ought not
    to be a distinction of states and duties in the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written in praise of the Church (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++44%3A10"
      >Ps. 44:10</a
    >) that she is "surrounded with variety": and a gloss on these words says
    that "the Queen," namely the Church, "is bedecked with the teaching of the
    apostles, the confession of martyrs, the purity of virgins, the sorrowings
    of penitents."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The difference of states and duties in the
    Church regards three things. In the first place it regards the perfection of
    the Church. For even as in the order of natural things, perfection, which in
    God is simple and uniform, is not to be found in the created universe except
    in a multiform and manifold manner, so too, the fulness of grace, which is
    centered in Christ as head, flows forth to His members in various ways, for
    the perfecting of the body of the Church. This is the meaning of the
    Apostle's words (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++4%3A11,12"
      >Eph. 4:11,12</a
    >): "He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and other some evangelists,
    and other some pastors and doctors for the perfecting of the saints."
    Secondly, it regards the need of those actions which are necessary in the
    Church. For a diversity of actions requires a diversity of men appointed to
    them, in order that all things may be accomplished without delay or
    confusion; and this is indicated by the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++12%3A4,5"
      >Rm. 12:4,5</a
    >), "As in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the
    same office, so we being many are one body in Christ." Thirdly, this belongs
    to the dignity and beauty of the Church, which consist in a certain order;
    wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Kgs++10%3A4,5"
      >3 Kgs. 10:4,5</a
    >) that "when the queen of Saba saw all the wisdom of Solomon... and the
    apartments of his servants, and the order of his ministers... she had no
    longer any spirit in her." Hence the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Tim++2%3A20"
      >2 Tim. 2:20</a
    >) that "in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but
    also of wood and of earth."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The distinction of states and duties is
    not an obstacle to the unity of the Church, for this results from the unity
    of faith, charity, and mutual service, according to the saying of the
    Apostle (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++4%3A16"
      >Eph. 4:16</a
    >): "From whom the whole body being compacted," namely by faith, "and fitly
    joined together," namely by charity, "by what every joint supplieth," namely
    by one man serving another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as nature does not employ many
    means where one suffices, so neither does it confine itself to one where
    many are required, according to the saying of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++12%3A17"
      >1 Cor. 12:17</a
    >), "If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing?" Hence
    there was need in the Church, which is Christ's body, for the members to be
    differentiated by various duties, states, and grades.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as in the natural body the various
    members are held together in unity by the power of the quickening spirit,
    and are dissociated from one another as soon as that spirit departs, so too
    in the Church's body the peace of the various members is preserved by the
    power of the Holy Spirit, Who quickens the body of the Church, as stated in
    Jn. 6:64. Hence the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++4%3A3"
      >Eph. 4:3</a
    >): "Careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." Now a
    man departs from this unity of spirit when he seeks his own; just as in an
    earthly kingdom peace ceases when the citizens seek each man his own.
    Besides, the peace both of mind and of an earthly commonwealth is the better
    preserved by a distinction of duties and states, since thereby the greater
    number have a share in public actions. Wherefore the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++12%3A24,25"
      >1 Cor. 12:24,25</a
    >) that "God hath tempered [the body] together that there might be no schism
    in the body, but the members might be mutually careful one for another."<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether duties differ according to their actions?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that duties do not differ according
    to their actions. For there are infinite varieties of human acts both in
    spirituals and in temporals. Now there can be no certain distinction among
    things that are infinite in number. Therefore human duties cannot be
    differentiated according to a difference of acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the active and the contemplative life
    differ according to their acts, as stated above (<a
      href="SS179.html#SSQ179OUTP1"
      >Question [179]</a
    >, <a href="SS179.html#SSQ179A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But the distinction
    of duties seems to be other than the distinction of lives. Therefore duties
    do not differ according to their acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, even ecclesiastical orders, states, and
    grades seemingly differ according to their acts. If, then, duties differ
    according to their acts it would seem that duties, grades, and states differ
    in the same way. Yet this is not true, since they are divided into their
    respective parts in different ways. Therefore duties do not differ according
    to their acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says (Etym. vi, 19) that "officium
    [duty] takes its name from 'efficere' [to effect], as though it were instead
    of 'efficium,' by the change of one letter for the sake of the sound." But
    effecting pertains to action. Therefore duties differ according to their
    acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS183.html#SSQ183A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), difference among the members of the Church is directed to three things:
    perfection, action, and beauty; and according to these three we may
    distinguish a threefold distinction among the faithful. One, with regard to
    perfection, and thus we have the difference of states, in reference to which
    some persons are more perfect than others. Another distinction regards
    action and this is the distinction of duties: for persons are said to have
    various duties when they are appointed to various actions. A third
    distinction regards the order of ecclesiastical beauty: and thus we
    distinguish various grades according as in the same state or duty one person
    is above another. Hence according to a variant text [*The Septuagint] it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++47%3A4"
      >Ps. 47:4</a
    >): "In her grades shall God be known."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The material diversity of human acts is
    infinite. It is not thus that duties differ, but by their formal diversity
    which results from diverse species of acts, and in this way human acts are
    not infinite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Life is predicated of a thing
    absolutely: wherefore diversity of acts which are becoming to man considered
    in himself. But efficiency, whence we have the word "office" (as stated
    above), denotes action tending to something else according to Metaph. ix,
    text. 16 [*Ed. Did. viii, 8]. Hence offices differ properly in respect of
    acts that are referred to other persons; thus a teacher is said to have an
    office, and so is a judge, and so forth. Wherefore Isidore says (Etym. vi,
    19) that "to have an office is to be officious," i.e. harmful "to no one,
    but to be useful to all."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Differences of state, offices and grades
    are taken from different things, as stated above (<a
      href="SS183.html#SSQ183A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 3). Yet these three things may concur in the same subject: thus when a
    person is appointed to a higher action, he attains thereby both office and
    grade, and sometimes, besides this, a state of perfection, on account of the
    sublimity of the act, as in the case of a bishop. The ecclesiastical orders
    are particularly distinct according to divine offices. For Isidore says
    (Etym. vi): "There are various kinds of offices; but the foremost is that
    which relates to sacred and Divine things."<br />

    Whether the difference of states applies to those who are beginning,
    progressing, or perfect?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the difference of states does
    not apply to those who are beginning, progressing, or perfect. For "diverse
    genera have diverse species and differences" [*Aristotle, Categ. ii]. Now
    this difference of beginning, progress, and perfection is applied to the
    degrees of charity, as stated above (<a href="SS024.html#SSQ24OUTP1"
      >Question [24]</a
    >, <a href="SS024.html#SSQ24A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>), where we were
    treating of charity. Therefore it would seem that the differences of states
    should not be assigned in this manner.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<a
      href="SS183.html#SSQ183A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), state regards a condition of servitude or freedom, which apparently has
    no connection with the aforesaid difference of beginning, progress, and
    perfection. Therefore it is unfitting to divide state in this way.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the distinction of beginning, progress,
    and perfection seems to refer to "more" and "less," and this seemingly
    implies the notion of grades. But the distinction of grades differs from
    that of states, as we have said above (<a href="SS183.html#SSQ183ATHEP1"
      >Articles [2]</a
    >,3). Therefore state is unfittingly divided according to beginning,
    progress, and perfection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xxiv, 11): "There are
    three states of the converted, the beginning, the middle, and the
    perfection"; and (Hom. xv in Ezech.): "Other is the beginning of virtue,
    other its progress, and other still its perfection."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS183.html#SSQ183A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >) state regards freedom or servitude. Now in spiritual things there is a
    twofold servitude and a twofold freedom: for there is the servitude of sin
    and the servitude of justice; and there is likewise a twofold freedom, from
    sin, and from justice, as appears from the words of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++6%3A20,22"
      >Rm. 6:20,22</a
    >), "When you were the servants of sin, you were free men to justice... but
    now being made free from sin," you are... "become servants to God."
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the servitude of sin or justice consists in being inclined to evil by a
    habit of sin, or inclined to good by a habit of justice: and in like manner
    freedom from sin is not to be overcome by the inclination to sin, and
    freedom from justice is not to be held back from evil for the love of
    justice. Nevertheless, since man, by his natural reason, is inclined to
    justice, while sin is contrary to natural reason, it follows that freedom
    from sin is true freedom which is united to the servitude of justice, since
    they both incline man to that which is becoming to him. In like manner true
    servitude is the servitude of sin, which is connected with freedom from
    justice, because man is thereby hindered from attaining that which is proper
    to him. That a man become the servant of justice or sin results from his
    efforts, as the Apostle declares (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++6%3A16"
      >Rm. 6:16</a
    >): "To whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are
    whom you obey, whether it be of sin unto death, or of obedience unto
    justice." Now in every human effort we can distinguish a beginning, a
    middle, and a term; and consequently the state of spiritual servitude and
    freedom is differentiated according to these things, namely, the
    beginning---to which pertains the state of beginners---the middle, to which
    pertains the state of the proficient---and the term, to which belongs the
    state of the perfect.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Freedom from sin results from charity
    which "is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, Who is given to us"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A5">Rm. 5:5</a>).
    Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++3%3A17"
      >2 Cor. 3:17</a
    >): "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." Wherefore the same
    division applies to charity as to the state of those who enjoy spiritual
    freedom.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Men are said to be beginners,
    proficient, and perfect (so far as these terms indicate different states),
    not in relation to any occupation whatever, but in relation to such
    occupations as pertain to spiritual freedom or servitude, as stated above
    (<a href="SS183.html#SSQ183A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As already observed (<a
      href="SS183.html#SSQ183A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >, ad 3), nothing hinders grade and state from concurring in the same
    subject. For even in earthly affairs those who are free, not only belong to
    a different state from those who are in service, but are also of a different
    grade.<br />
