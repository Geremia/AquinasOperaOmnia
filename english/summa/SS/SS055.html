  <h3 align="left">Whether prudence of the flesh is a sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prudence of the flesh is not a
    sin. For prudence is more excellent than the other moral virtues, since it
    governs them all. But no justice or temperance is sinful. Neither therefore
    is any prudence a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is not a sin to act prudently for an
    end which it is lawful to love. But it is lawful to love the flesh, "for no
    man ever hated his own flesh" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A29"
      >Eph. 5:29</a
    >). Therefore prudence of the flesh is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as man is tempted by the flesh, so
    too is he tempted by the world and the devil. But no prudence of the world,
    or of the devil is accounted a sin. Therefore neither should any prudence of
    the flesh be accounted among sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> No man is an enemy to God save for wickedness
    according to Wis. 14:9, "To God the wicked and his wickedness are hateful
    alike." Now it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A7"
      >Rm. 8:7</a
    >): "The prudence [Vulg.: 'wisdom'] of the flesh is an enemy to God."
    Therefore prudence of the flesh is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1"
      >Question [47]</a
    >, <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A13THEP1">Article [13]</a>), prudence regards
    things which are directed to the end of life as a whole. Hence prudence of
    the flesh signifies properly the prudence of a man who looks upon carnal
    goods as the last end of his life. Now it is evident that this is a sin,
    because it involves a disorder in man with respect to his last end, which
    does not consist in the goods of the body, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS002.html#FSQ2A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore prudence
    of the flesh is a sin.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Justice and temperance include in their
    very nature that which ranks them among the virtues, viz. equality and the
    curbing of concupiscence; hence they are never taken in a bad sense. On the
    other hand prudence is so called from foreseeing [providendo], as stated
    above (<a href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>,
    <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="SS049.html#SSQ49OUTP1">Question [49]</a>,
    <a href="SS049.html#SSQ49A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), which can extend to evil
    things also. Therefore, although prudence is taken simply in a good sense,
    yet, if something be added, it may be taken in a bad sense: and it is thus
    that prudence of the flesh is said to be a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The flesh is on account of the soul, as
    matter is on account of the form, and the instrument on account of the
    principal agent. Hence the flesh is loved lawfully, if it be directed to the
    good of the soul as its end. If, however, a man place his last end in a good
    of the flesh, his love will be inordinate and unlawful, and it is thus that
    the prudence of the flesh is directed to the love of the flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The devil tempts us, not through the
    good of the appetible object, but by way of suggestion. Wherefore, since
    prudence implies direction to some appetible end, we do not speak of
    "prudence of the devil," as of a prudence directed to some evil end, which
    is the aspect under which the world and the flesh tempt us, in so far as
    worldly or carnal goods are proposed to our appetite. Hence we speak of
    "carnal" and again of "worldly" prudence, according to Lk. 16:8, "The
    children of this world are more prudent [Douay: 'wiser'] in their
    generation," etc. The Apostle includes all in the "prudence of the flesh,"
    because we covet the external things of the world on account of the
    flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also reply that since prudence is in a certain sense called "wisdom,"
    as stated above (<a href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>,
    <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1), we may distinguish
    a threefold prudence corresponding to the three kinds of temptation. Hence
    it is written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+3%3A15"
      >James 3:15</a
    >) that there is a wisdom which is "earthly, sensual and devilish," as
    explained above (<a href="SS045.html#SSQ45OUTP1">Question [45]</a>,
    <a href="SS045.html#SSQ45A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), when we were
    treating of wisdom.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether prudence of the flesh is a mortal sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prudence of the flesh is a
    mortal sin. For it is a mortal sin to rebel against the Divine law, since
    this implies contempt of God. Now "the prudence [Douay: 'wisdom'] of the
    flesh... is not subject to the law of God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A7"
      >Rm. 8:7</a
    >). Therefore prudence of the flesh is a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every sin against the Holy Ghost is a
    mortal sin. Now prudence of the flesh seems to be a sin against the Holy
    Ghost, for "it cannot be subject to the law of God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A7"
      >Rm. 8:7</a
    >), and so it seems to be an unpardonable sin, which is proper to the sin
    against the Holy Ghost. Therefore prudence of the flesh is a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the greatest evil is opposed to the
    greatest good, as stated in Ethic. viii, 10. Now prudence of the flesh is
    opposed to that prudence which is the chief of the moral virtues. Therefore
    prudence of the flesh is chief among mortal sins, so that it is itself a
    mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> That which diminishes a sin has not of itself
    the nature of a mortal sin. Now the thoughtful quest of things pertaining to
    the care of the flesh, which seems to pertain to carnal prudence, diminishes
    sin [*Cf. Prov. 6:30]. Therefore prudence of the flesh has not of itself the
    nature of a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1"
      >Question [47]</a
    >, <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1;
    <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A2A13THEP1">Article [13]</a>), a man is said to be
    prudent in two ways. First, simply, i.e. in relation to the end of life as a
    whole. Secondly, relatively, i.e. in relation to some particular end; thus a
    man is said to be prudent in business or something else of the kind.
    Accordingly if prudence of the flesh be taken as corresponding to prudence
    in its absolute signification, so that a man place the last end of his whole
    life in the care of the flesh, it is a mortal sin, because he turns away
    from God by so doing, since he cannot have several last ends, as stated
    above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, on the other hand, prudence of the flesh be taken as corresponding to
    particular prudence, it is a venial sin. For it happens sometimes that a man
    has an inordinate affection for some pleasure of the flesh, without turning
    away from God by a mortal sin; in which case he does not place the end of
    his whole life in carnal pleasure. To apply oneself to obtain this pleasure
    is a venial sin and pertains to prudence of the flesh. But if a man actually
    refers the care of the flesh to a good end, as when one is careful about
    one's food in order to sustain one's body, this is no longer prudence of the
    flesh, because then one uses the care of the flesh as a means to an end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle is speaking of that carnal
    prudence whereby a man places the end of his whole life in the goods of the
    flesh, and this is a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Prudence of the flesh does not imply a
    sin against the Holy Ghost. For when it is stated that "it cannot be subject
    to the law of God," this does not mean that he who has prudence of the
    flesh, cannot be converted and submit to the law of God, but that carnal
    prudence itself cannot be subject to God's law, even as neither can
    injustice be just, nor heat cold, although that which is hot may become
    cold.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Every sin is opposed to prudence, just
    as prudence is shared by every virtue. But it does not follow that every sin
    opposed to prudence is most grave, but only when it is opposed to prudence
    in some very grave matter.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether craftiness is a special sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that craftiness is not a special
    sin. For the words of Holy Writ do not induce anyone to sin; and yet they
    induce us to be crafty, according to Prov. 1:4, "To give craftiness [Douay:
    'subtlety'] to little ones." Therefore craftiness is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++13%3A16"
      >Prov. 13:16</a
    >): "The crafty [Douay: 'prudent'] man doth all things with counsel."
    Therefore, he does so either for a good or for an evil end. If for a good
    end, there is no sin seemingly, and if for an evil end, it would seem to
    pertain to carnal or worldly prudence. Therefore craftiness is not a special
    sin distinct from prudence of the flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory expounding the words of Job 12,
    "The simplicity of the just man is laughed to scorn," says (Moral. x, 29):
    "The wisdom of this world is to hide one's thoughts by artifice, to conceal
    one's meaning by words, to represent error as truth, to make out the truth
    to be false," and further on he adds: "This prudence is acquired by the
    young, it is learnt at a price by children." Now the above things seem to
    belong to craftiness. Therefore craftiness is not distinct from carnal or
    worldly prudence, and consequently it seems not to be a special sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++4%3A2"
      >2 Cor. 4:2</a
    >): "We renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness,
    nor adulterating the word of God." Therefore craftiness is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Prudence is "right reason applied to action,"
    just as science is "right reason applied to knowledge." In speculative
    matters one may sin against rectitude of knowledge in two ways: in one way
    when the reason is led to a false conclusion that appears to be true; in
    another way when the reason proceeds from false premises, that appear to be
    true, either to a true or to a false conclusion. Even so a sin may be
    against prudence, through having some resemblance thereto, in two ways.
    First, when the purpose of the reason is directed to an end which is good
    not in truth but in appearance, and this pertains to prudence of the flesh;
    secondly, when, in order to obtain a certain end, whether good or evil, a
    man uses means that are not true but fictitious and counterfeit, and this
    belongs to the sin of craftiness. This is consequently a sin opposed to
    prudence, and distinct from prudence of the flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine observes (Contra Julian.
    iv, 3) just as prudence is sometimes improperly taken in a bad sense, so is
    craftiness sometimes taken in a good sense, and this on account of their
    mutual resemblance. Properly speaking, however, craftiness is taken in a bad
    sense, as the Philosopher states in Ethic. vi, 12.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Craftiness can take counsel both for a
    good end and for an evil end: nor should a good end be pursued by means that
    are false and counterfeit but by such as are true. Hence craftiness is a sin
    if it be directed to a good end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Under "worldly prudence" Gregory
    included everything that can pertain to false prudence, so that it comprises
    craftiness also.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether guile is a sin pertaining to craftiness?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that guile is not a sin pertaining
    to craftiness. For sin, especially mortal, has no place in perfect men. Yet
    a certain guile is to be found in them, according to 2 Cor. 12:16, "Being
    crafty I caught you by guile." Therefore guile is not always a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, guile seems to pertain chiefly to the
    tongue, according to Ps. 5:11, "They dealt deceitfully with their tongues."
    Now craftiness like prudence is in the very act of reason. Therefore guile
    does not pertain to craftiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++12%3A20"
      >Prov. 12:20</a
    >): "Guile [Douay: 'Deceit'] is in the heart of them that think evil
    things." But the thought of evil things does not always pertain to
    craftiness. Therefore guile does not seem to belong to craftiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Craftiness aims at lying in wait, according
    to Eph. 4:14, "By cunning craftiness by which they lie in wait to deceive":
    and guile aims at this also. Therefore guile pertains to craftiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS055.html#SSQ55A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), it belongs to craftiness to adopt ways that are not true but counterfeit
    and apparently true, in order to attain some end either good or evil. Now
    the adopting of such ways may be subjected to a twofold consideration;
    first, as regards the process of thinking them out, and this belongs
    properly to craftiness, even as thinking out right ways to a due end belongs
    to prudence. Secondly the adopting of such like ways may be considered with
    regard to their actual execution, and in this way it belongs to guile. Hence
    guile denotes a certain execution of craftiness, and accordingly belongs
    thereto.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as craftiness is taken properly in
    a bad sense, and improperly in a good sense, so too is guile which is the
    execution of craftiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The execution of craftiness with the
    purpose of deceiving, is effected first and foremost by words, which hold
    the chief place among those signs whereby a man signifies something to
    another man, as Augustine states (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 3), hence guile is
    ascribed chiefly to speech. Yet guile may happen also in deeds, according to
    Ps. 104:25, "And to deal deceitfully with his servants." Guile is also in
    the heart, according to Ecclus. 19:23, "His interior is full of deceit," but
    this is to devise deceits, according to Ps. 37:13: "They studied deceits all
    the day long."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Whoever purposes to do some evil deed,
    must needs devise certain ways of attaining his purpose, and for the most
    part he devises deceitful ways, whereby the more easily to obtain his end.
    Nevertheless it happens sometimes that evil is done openly and by violence
    without craftiness and guile; but as this is more difficult, it is of less
    frequent occurrence.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether fraud pertains to craftiness?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that fraud does not pertain to
    craftiness. For a man does not deserve praise if he allows himself to be
    deceived, which is the object of craftiness; and yet a man deserves praise
    for allowing himself to be defrauded, according to 1 Cor. 6:1, "Why do you
    not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?" Therefore fraud does not
    belong to craftiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, fraud seems to consist in unlawfully
    taking or receiving external things, for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+5%3A1"
      >Acts 5:1</a
    >) that "a certain man named Ananias with Saphira his wife, sold a piece of
    land, and by fraud kept back part of the price of the land." Now it pertains
    to injustice or illiberality to take possession of or retain external things
    unjustly. Therefore fraud does not belong to craftiness which is opposed to
    prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no man employs craftiness against
    himself. But the frauds of some are against themselves, for it is written
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++1%3A18">Prov. 1:18</a
    >) concerning some "that they practice frauds [Douay: 'deceits'] against
    their own souls." Therefore fraud does not belong to craftiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The object of fraud is to deceive, according
    to Job 13:9, "Shall he be deceived as a man, with your fraudulent [Douay:
    'deceitful'] dealings?" Now craftiness is directed to the same object.
    Therefore fraud pertains to craftiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Just as "guile" consists in the execution of
    craftiness, so also does "fraud." But they seem to differ in the fact that
    "guile" belongs in general to the execution of craftiness, whether this be
    effected by words, or by deeds, whereas "fraud" belongs more properly to the
    execution of craftiness by deeds.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle does not counsel the
    faithful to be deceived in their knowledge, but to bear patiently the effect
    of being deceived, and to endure wrongs inflicted on them by fraud.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The execution of craftiness may be
    carried out by another vice, just as the execution of prudence by the
    virtues: and accordingly nothing hinders fraud from pertaining to
    covetousness or illiberality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who commit frauds, do not design
    anything against themselves or their own souls; it is through God's just
    judgment that what they plot against others, recoils on themselves,
    according to Ps. 7:16, "He is fallen into the hole he made."<br />

    Whether it is lawful to be solicitous about temporal matters?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem lawful to be solicitous about
    temporal matters. Because a superior should be solicitous for his subjects,
    according to Rm. 12:8, "He that ruleth, with solicitude." Now according to
    the Divine ordering, man is placed over temporal things, according to Ps.
    8:8, "Thou hast subjected all things under his feet," etc. Therefore man
    should be solicitous about temporal things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, everyone is solicitous about the end for
    which he works. Now it is lawful for a man to work for the temporal things
    whereby he sustains life, wherefore the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Thess++3%3A10"
      >2 Thess. 3:10</a
    >): "If any man will not work, neither let him eat." Therefore it is lawful
    to be solicitous about temporal things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, solicitude about works of mercy is
    praiseworthy, according to 2 Tim. 1:17, "When he was come to Rome, he
    carefully sought me." Now solicitude about temporal things is sometimes
    connected with works of mercy; for instance, when a man is solicitous to
    watch over the interests of orphans and poor persons. Therefore solicitude
    about temporal things is not unlawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A31"
      >Mt. 6:31</a
    >): "Be not solicitous... saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink,
    or wherewith shall we be clothed?" And yet such things are very
    necessary.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Solicitude denotes an earnest endeavor to
    obtain something. Now it is evident that the endeavor is more earnest when
    there is fear of failure, so that there is less solicitude when success is
    assured. Accordingly solicitude about temporal things may be unlawful in
    three ways. First on the part of the object of solicitude; that is, if we
    seek temporal things as an end. Hence Augustine says (De Operibus Monach.
    xxvi): "When Our Lord said: 'Be not solicitous,' etc.... He intended to
    forbid them either to make such things their end, or for the sake of these
    things to do whatever they were commanded to do in preaching the Gospel."
    Secondly, solicitude about temporal things may be unlawful, through too much
    earnestness in endeavoring to obtain temporal things, the result being that
    a man is drawn away from spiritual things which ought to be the chief object
    of his search, wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++13%3A22"
      >Mt. 13:22</a
    >) that "the care of this world... chokes up the word." Thirdly, through
    over much fear, when, to wit, a man fears to lack necessary things if he do
    what he ought to do. Now our Lord gives three motives for laying aside this
    fear. First, on account of the yet greater favors bestowed by God on man,
    independently of his solicitude, viz. his body and soul (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A26"
      >Mt. 6:26</a
    >); secondly, on account of the care with which God watches over animals and
    plants without the assistance of man, according to the requirements of their
    nature; thirdly, because of Divine providence, through ignorance of which
    the gentiles are solicitous in seeking temporal goods before all others.
    Consequently He concludes that we should be solicitous most of all about
    spiritual goods, hoping that temporal goods also may be granted us according
    to our needs, if we do what we ought to do.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Temporal goods are subjected to man that
    he may use them according to his needs, not that he may place his end in
    them and be over solicitous about them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The solicitude of a man who gains his
    bread by bodily labor is not superfluous but proportionate; hence Jerome
    says on Mt. 6:31, "Be not solicitous," that "labor is necessary, but
    solicitude must be banished," namely superfluous solicitude which unsettles
    the mind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the works of mercy solicitude about
    temporal things is directed to charity as its end, wherefore it is not
    unlawful, unless it be superfluous.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether we should be solicitous about the future?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we should be solicitous about
    the future. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++6%3A6-8"
      >Prov. 6:6-8</a
    >): "Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways and learn wisdom;
    which, although she hath no guide, nor master... provideth her meat for
    herself in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest." Now this is
    to be solicitous about the future. Therefore solicitude about the future is
    praiseworthy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, solicitude pertains to prudence. But
    prudence is chiefly about the future, since its principal part is "foresight
    of future things," as stated above (<a href="SS049.html#SSQ49OUTP1"
      >Question [49]</a
    >, <a href="SS049.html#SSQ49A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 1). Therefore it is
    virtuous to be solicitous about the future.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whoever puts something by that he may
    keep it for the morrow, is solicitous about the future. Now we read (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++12%3A6"
      >Jn. 12:6</a
    >) that Christ had a bag for keeping things in, which Judas carried, and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+4%3A34-37"
      >Acts 4:34-37</a
    >) that the Apostles kept the price of the land, which had been laid at
    their feet. Therefore it is lawful to be solicitous about the future.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A34"
      >Mt. 6:34</a
    >): "Be not... solicitous for tomorrow"; where "tomorrow" stands for the
    future, as Jerome says in his commentary on this passage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> No work can be virtuous, unless it be vested
    with its due circumstances, and among these is the due time, according to
    Eccles. 8:6, "There is a time and opportunity for every business"; which
    applies not only to external deeds but also to internal solicitude. For
    every time has its own fitting proper solicitude; thus solicitude about the
    crops belongs to the summer time, and solicitude about the vintage to the
    time of autumn. Accordingly if a man were solicitous about the vintage
    during the summer, he would be needlessly forestalling the solicitude
    belonging to a future time. Hence Our Lord forbids such like excessive
    solicitude, saying: "Be... not solicitous for tomorrow," wherefore He adds,
    "for the morrow will be solicitous for itself," that is to say, the morrow
    will have its own solicitude, which will be burden enough for the soul. This
    is what He means by adding: "Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,"
    namely, the burden of solicitude.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The ant is solicitous at a befitting
    time, and it is this that is proposed for our example.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Due foresight of the future belongs to
    prudence. But it would be an inordinate foresight or solicitude about the
    future, if a man were to seek temporal things, to which the terms "past" and
    "future" apply, as ends, or if he were to seek them in excess of the needs
    of the present life, or if he were to forestall the time for solicitude.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in
    Monte ii, 17), "when we see a servant of God taking thought lest he lack
    these needful things, we must not judge him to be solicitous for the morrow,
    since even Our Lord deigned for our example to have a purse, and we read in
    the Acts of the Apostles that they procured the necessary means of
    livelihood in view of the future on account of a threatened famine. Hence
    Our Lord does not condemn those who according to human custom, provide
    themselves with such things, but those who oppose themselves to God for the
    sake of these things."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether these vices arise from covetousness?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that these vices do not arise from
    covetousness. As stated above (<a href="SS043.html#SSQ43OUTP1"
      >Question [43]</a
    >, <a href="SS043.html#SSQ43A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>) lust is the chief
    cause of lack of rectitude in the reason. Now these vices are opposed to
    right reason, i.e. to prudence. Therefore they arise chiefly from lust;
    especially since the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 6) that "Venus is full of
    guile and her girdle is many colored" and that "he who is incontinent in
    desire acts with cunning."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, these vices bear a certain resemblance
    to prudence, as stated above (<a href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1"
      >Question [47]</a
    >, <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A13THEP1">Article [13]</a>). Now, since prudence
    is in the reason, the more spiritual vices seem to be more akin thereto,
    such as pride and vainglory. Therefore the aforesaid vices seem to arise
    from pride rather than from covetousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, men make use of stratagems not only in
    laying hold of other people's goods, but also in plotting murders, the
    former of which pertains to covetousness, and the latter to anger. Now the
    use of stratagems pertains to craftiness, guile, and fraud. Therefore the
    aforesaid vices arise not only from covetousness, but also from anger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45) states that fraud
    is a daughter of covetousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS055.html#SSQ55A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >; <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>,
    <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A13THEP1">Article [13]</a>), carnal prudence and
    craftiness, as well as guile and fraud, bear a certain resemblance to
    prudence in some kind of use of the reason. Now among all the moral virtues
    it is justice wherein the use of right reason appears chiefly, for justice
    is in the rational appetite. Hence the undue use of reason appears chiefly
    in the vices opposed to justice, the chief of which is covetousness.
    Therefore the aforesaid vices arise chiefly from covetousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> On account of the vehemence of pleasure
    and of concupiscence, lust entirely suppresses the reason from exercising
    its act: whereas in the aforesaid vices there is some use of reason, albeit
    inordinate. Hence these vices do not arise directly from lust. When the
    Philosopher says that "Venus is full of guile," he is referring to a certain
    resemblance, in so far as she carries man away suddenly, just as he is moved
    in deceitful actions, yet not by means of craftiness but rather by the
    vehemence of concupiscence and pleasure; wherefore he adds that "Venus doth
    cozen the wits of the wisest man" [*Cf. Iliad xiv, 214-217].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To do anything by stratagem seems to be
    due to pusillanimity: because a magnanimous man wishes to act openly, as the
    Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 3). Wherefore, as pride resembles or apes
    magnanimity, it follows that the aforesaid vices which make use of fraud and
    guile, do not arise directly from pride, but rather from covetousness, which
    seeks its own profit and sets little by excellence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Anger's movement is sudden, hence it
    acts with precipitation, and without counsel, contrary to the use of the
    aforesaid vices, though these use counsel inordinately. That men use
    stratagems in plotting murders, arises not from anger but rather from
    hatred, because the angry man desires to harm manifestly, as the Philosopher
    states (Rhet. ii, 2,3) [*Cf. Ethic. vii, 6].<br />
