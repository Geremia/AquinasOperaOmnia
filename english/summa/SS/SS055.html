<H3 Align="Left">Whether prudence of the flesh is a sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prudence of the flesh is not a sin. For 
prudence is more excellent than the other moral virtues, since it governs 
them all. But no justice or temperance is sinful. Neither therefore is 
any prudence a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is not a sin to act prudently for an end which it is 
lawful to love. But it is lawful to love the flesh, "for no man ever 
hated his own flesh" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++5%3A29">Eph. 5:29</a>). Therefore prudence of the flesh is not 
a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as man is tempted by the flesh, so too is he 
tempted by the world and the devil. But no prudence of the world, or of 
the devil is accounted a sin. Therefore neither should any prudence of 
the flesh be accounted among sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> No man is an enemy to God save for wickedness according 
to Wis. 14:9, "To God the wicked and his wickedness are hateful alike." 
Now it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A7">Rm. 8:7</a>): "The prudence [Vulg.: 'wisdom'] of the flesh 
is an enemy to God." Therefore prudence of the flesh is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A13THEP1">Article [13]</a>), prudence regards things 
which are directed to the end of life as a whole. Hence prudence of the 
flesh signifies properly the prudence of a man who looks upon carnal 
goods as the last end of his life. Now it is evident that this is a sin, 
because it involves a disorder in man with respect to his last end, which 
does not consist in the goods of the body, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS002.html#FSQ2A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore prudence of the flesh is a sin.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Justice and temperance include in their very nature that 
which ranks them among the virtues, viz. equality and the curbing of 
concupiscence; hence they are never taken in a bad sense. On the other 
hand prudence is so called from foreseeing [providendo], as stated above 
(<A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="SS049.html#SSQ49OUTP1">Question [49]</a>, <A Href="SS049.html#SSQ49A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), which can extend to evil things also. 
Therefore, although prudence is taken simply in a good sense, yet, if 
something be added, it may be taken in a  bad sense: and it is thus that 
prudence of the flesh is said to be a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The flesh is on account of the soul, as matter is on 
account of the form, and the instrument on account of the principal 
agent. Hence the flesh is loved lawfully, if it be directed to the good 
of the soul as its end. If, however, a man place his last end in a good 
of the flesh, his love will be inordinate and unlawful, and it is thus 
that the prudence of the flesh is directed to the love of the flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The devil tempts us, not through the good of the appetible 
object, but by way of suggestion. Wherefore, since prudence implies 
direction to some appetible end, we do not speak of "prudence of the 
devil," as of a prudence directed to some evil end, which is the aspect 
under which the world and the flesh tempt us, in so far as worldly or 
carnal goods are proposed to our appetite. Hence we speak of "carnal" and 
again of "worldly" prudence, according to Lk. 16:8, "The children of this 
world are more prudent [Douay: 'wiser'] in their generation," etc. The 
Apostle includes all in the "prudence of the flesh," because we covet the 
external things of the world on account of the flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also reply that since prudence is in a certain sense called 
"wisdom," as stated above (<A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1), we may distinguish a 
threefold prudence corresponding to the three kinds of temptation. Hence 
it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+3%3A15">James 3:15</a>) that there is a wisdom which is "earthly, 
sensual and devilish," as explained above (<A Href="SS045.html#SSQ45OUTP1">Question [45]</a>, <A Href="SS045.html#SSQ45A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), when we 
were treating of wisdom.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether prudence of the flesh is a mortal sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prudence of the flesh is a mortal sin. For it 
is a mortal sin to rebel against the Divine law, since this implies 
contempt of God. Now "the prudence [Douay: 'wisdom'] of the flesh . . . 
is not subject to the law of God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A7">Rm. 8:7</a>). Therefore prudence of the 
flesh is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every sin against the Holy Ghost is a mortal sin. Now 
prudence of the flesh seems to be a sin against the Holy Ghost, for "it 
cannot be subject to the law of God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8%3A7">Rm. 8:7</a>), and so it seems to be an 
unpardonable sin, which is proper to the sin against the Holy Ghost. 
Therefore prudence of the flesh is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the greatest evil is opposed to the greatest good, as 
stated in Ethic. viii, 10. Now prudence of the flesh is opposed to that 
prudence which is the chief of the moral virtues. Therefore prudence of 
the flesh is chief among mortal sins, so that it is itself a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> That which diminishes a sin has not of itself the 
nature of a mortal sin. Now the thoughtful quest of things  pertaining to 
the care of the flesh, which seems to pertain to carnal prudence, 
diminishes sin [*Cf. Prov. 6:30]. Therefore prudence of the flesh has not 
of itself the nature of a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A2A13THEP1">Article [13]</a>), a man is said 
to be prudent in two ways. First, simply, i.e. in relation to the end of 
life as a whole. Secondly, relatively, i.e. in relation to some 
particular end; thus a man is said to be prudent in business or something 
else of the kind. Accordingly if prudence of the flesh be taken as 
corresponding to prudence in its absolute signification, so that a man 
place the last end of his whole life in the care of the flesh, it is a 
mortal sin, because he turns away from God by so doing, since he cannot 
have several last ends, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, on the other hand, prudence of the flesh be taken as corresponding 
to particular prudence, it is a venial sin. For it happens sometimes that 
a man has an inordinate affection for some pleasure of the flesh, without 
turning away from God by a mortal sin; in which case he does not place 
the end of his whole life in carnal pleasure. To apply oneself to obtain 
this pleasure is a venial sin and pertains to prudence of the flesh. But 
if a man actually refers the care of the flesh to a good end, as when one 
is careful about one's food in order to sustain one's body, this is no 
longer prudence of the flesh, because then one uses the care of the flesh 
as a means to an end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle is speaking of that carnal prudence whereby a 
man places the end of his whole life in the goods of the flesh, and this 
is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Prudence of the flesh does not imply a sin against the Holy 
Ghost. For when it is stated that "it cannot be subject to the law of 
God," this does not mean that he who has prudence of the flesh, cannot be 
converted and submit to the law of God, but that carnal prudence itself 
cannot be subject to God's law, even as neither can injustice be just, 
nor heat cold, although that which is hot may become cold.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Every sin is opposed to prudence, just as prudence is 
shared by every virtue. But it does not follow that every sin opposed to 
prudence is most grave, but only when it is opposed to prudence in some 
very grave matter.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether craftiness is a special sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that craftiness is not a special sin. For the words 
of Holy Writ do not induce anyone to sin; and yet they induce us to be 
crafty, according to Prov. 1:4, "To give craftiness [Douay: 'subtlety'] 
to little ones." Therefore craftiness is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++13%3A16">Prov. 13:16</a>): "The crafty  [Douay: 
'prudent'] man doth all things with counsel." Therefore, he does so 
either for a good or for an evil end. If for a good end, there is no sin 
seemingly, and if for an evil end, it would seem to pertain to carnal or 
worldly prudence. Therefore craftiness is not a special sin distinct from 
prudence of the flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory expounding the words of Job 12, "The simplicity 
of the just man is laughed to scorn," says (Moral. x, 29): "The wisdom of 
this world is to hide one's thoughts by artifice, to conceal one's 
meaning by words, to represent error as truth, to make out the truth to 
be false," and further on he adds: "This prudence is acquired by the 
young, it is learnt at a price by children." Now the above things seem to 
belong to craftiness. Therefore craftiness is not distinct from carnal or 
worldly prudence, and consequently it seems not to be a special sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++4%3A2">2 Cor. 4:2</a>): "We renounce the hidden 
things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the 
word of God." Therefore craftiness is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Prudence is "right reason applied to action," just as 
science is "right reason applied to knowledge." In speculative matters 
one may sin against rectitude of knowledge in two ways: in one way when 
the reason is led to a false conclusion that appears to be true; in 
another way when the reason proceeds from false premises, that appear to 
be true, either to a true or to a false conclusion. Even so a sin may be 
against prudence, through having some resemblance thereto, in two ways. 
First, when the purpose of the reason is directed to an end which is good 
not in truth but in appearance, and this pertains to prudence of the 
flesh; secondly, when, in order to obtain a certain end, whether good or 
evil, a man uses means that are not true but fictitious and counterfeit, 
and this belongs to the sin of craftiness. This is consequently a sin 
opposed to prudence, and distinct from prudence of the flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine observes (Contra Julian. iv, 3) just as 
prudence is sometimes improperly taken in a bad sense, so is craftiness 
sometimes taken in a good sense, and this on account of their mutual 
resemblance. Properly speaking, however, craftiness is taken in a bad 
sense, as the Philosopher states in Ethic. vi, 12.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Craftiness can take counsel both for a good end and for an 
evil end: nor should a good end be pursued by means that are false and 
counterfeit but by such as are true. Hence craftiness is a sin if it be 
directed to a good end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Under "worldly prudence" Gregory included everything that 
can pertain to false prudence, so that it comprises craftiness also.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether guile is a sin pertaining to craftiness?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that guile is not a sin pertaining to craftiness. 
For sin, especially mortal, has no place in perfect men. Yet a certain 
guile is to be found in them, according to 2 Cor. 12:16, "Being crafty I 
caught you by guile." Therefore guile is not always a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, guile seems to pertain chiefly to the tongue, according 
to Ps. 5:11, "They dealt deceitfully with their tongues." Now craftiness 
like prudence is in the very act of reason. Therefore guile does not 
pertain to craftiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++12%3A20">Prov. 12:20</a>): "Guile [Douay: 'Deceit'] is 
in the heart of them that think evil things." But the thought of evil 
things does not always pertain to craftiness. Therefore guile does not 
seem to belong to craftiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Craftiness aims at lying in wait, according to Eph. 
4:14, "By cunning craftiness by which they lie in wait to deceive": and 
guile aims at this also. Therefore guile pertains to craftiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS055.html#SSQ55A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), it belongs to craftiness to adopt 
ways that are not true but counterfeit and apparently true, in order to 
attain some end either good or evil. Now the adopting of such ways may be 
subjected to a twofold consideration; first, as regards the process of 
thinking them out, and this belongs properly to craftiness, even as 
thinking out right ways to a due end belongs to prudence. Secondly the 
adopting of such like ways may be considered with regard to their actual 
execution, and in this way it belongs to guile. Hence guile denotes a 
certain execution of craftiness, and accordingly belongs thereto.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as craftiness is taken properly in a bad sense, and 
improperly in a good sense, so too is guile which is the execution of 
craftiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The execution of craftiness with the purpose of deceiving, 
is effected first and foremost by words, which hold the chief place among 
those signs whereby a man signifies something to another man, as 
Augustine states (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 3), hence guile is ascribed 
chiefly to speech. Yet guile may happen also in deeds, according to Ps. 
104:25, "And to deal deceitfully with his servants." Guile is also in the 
heart, according to Ecclus. 19:23, "His interior is full of deceit," but 
this is to devise deceits, according to Ps. 37:13: "They studied deceits 
all the day long."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Whoever purposes to do some evil deed, must needs devise 
certain ways of attaining his purpose, and for the most part he devises 
deceitful ways, whereby the more easily to obtain his end. Nevertheless 
it happens sometimes that evil is done openly and by violence without 
craftiness and guile; but as this is more difficult, it is of less 
frequent occurrence.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that fraud does not pertain to craftiness. For a 
man does not deserve praise if he allows himself to be deceived, which is 
the object of craftiness; and yet a man deserves praise for allowing 
himself to be defrauded, according to 1 Cor. 6:1, "Why do you not rather 
suffer yourselves to be defrauded?" Therefore fraud does not belong to 
craftiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, fraud seems to consist in unlawfully taking or receiving 
external things, for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+5%3A1">Acts 5:1</a>) that "a certain man named 
Ananias with Saphira his wife, sold a piece of land, and by fraud kept 
back part of the price of the land." Now it pertains to injustice or 
illiberality to take possession of or retain external things unjustly. 
Therefore fraud does not belong to craftiness which is opposed to 
prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no man employs craftiness against himself. But the 
frauds of some are against themselves, for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++1%3A18">Prov. 1:18</a>) 
concerning some "that they practice frauds [Douay: 'deceits'] against 
their own souls." Therefore fraud does not belong to craftiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The object of fraud is to deceive, according to Job 
13:9, "Shall he be deceived as a man, with your fraudulent [Douay: 
'deceitful'] dealings?" Now craftiness is directed to the same object. 
Therefore fraud pertains to craftiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Just as "guile" consists in the execution of craftiness, 
so also does "fraud." But they seem to differ in the fact that "guile" 
belongs in general to the execution of craftiness, whether this be 
effected by words, or by deeds, whereas "fraud" belongs more properly to 
the execution of craftiness by deeds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle does not counsel the faithful to be deceived in 
their knowledge, but to bear patiently the effect of being deceived, and 
to endure wrongs inflicted on them by fraud.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The execution of craftiness may be carried out by another 
vice, just as the execution of prudence by the virtues: and accordingly 
nothing hinders fraud from pertaining to covetousness or illiberality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who commit frauds, do not design anything against 
themselves or their own souls; it is through God's just judgment that 
what they plot against others, recoils on themselves, according to Ps. 
7:16, "He is fallen into the hole he made."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is lawful to be solicitous about temporal matters?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem lawful to be solicitous about temporal matters. 
Because a superior should be solicitous for his subjects,  according to 
Rm. 12:8, "He that ruleth, with solicitude." Now according to the Divine 
ordering, man is placed over temporal things, according to Ps. 8:8, "Thou 
hast subjected all things under his feet," etc. Therefore man should be 
solicitous about temporal things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, everyone is solicitous about the end for which he works. 
Now it is lawful for a man to work for the temporal things whereby he 
sustains life, wherefore the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Thess++3%3A10">2 Thess. 3:10</a>): "If any man 
will not work, neither let him eat." Therefore it is lawful to be 
solicitous about temporal things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, solicitude about works of mercy is praiseworthy, 
according to 2 Tim. 1:17, "When he was come to Rome, he carefully sought 
me." Now solicitude about temporal things is sometimes connected with 
works of mercy; for instance, when a man is solicitous to watch over the 
interests of orphans and poor persons. Therefore solicitude about 
temporal things is not unlawful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++6%3A31">Mt. 6:31</a>): "Be not solicitous . . . 
saying, What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we 
be clothed?" And yet such things are very necessary.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Solicitude denotes an earnest endeavor to obtain 
something. Now it is evident that the endeavor is more earnest when there 
is fear of failure, so that there is less solicitude when success is 
assured. Accordingly solicitude about temporal things may be unlawful in 
three ways. First on the part of the object of solicitude; that is, if we 
seek temporal things as an end. Hence Augustine says (De Operibus Monach. 
xxvi): "When Our Lord said: 'Be not solicitous,' etc. . . . He intended 
to forbid them either to make such things their end, or for the sake of 
these things to do whatever they were commanded to do in preaching the 
Gospel." Secondly, solicitude about temporal things may be unlawful, 
through too much earnestness in endeavoring to obtain temporal things, 
the result being that a man is drawn away from spiritual things which 
ought to be the chief object of his search, wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++13%3A22">Mt. 13:22</a>) that "the care of this world . . . chokes up the word." Thirdly, 
through over much fear, when, to wit, a man fears to lack necessary 
things if he do what he ought to do. Now our Lord gives three motives for 
laying aside this fear. First, on account of the yet greater favors 
bestowed by God on man, independently of his solicitude, viz. his body 
and soul (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++6%3A26">Mt. 6:26</a>); secondly, on account of the care with which God 
watches over animals and plants without the assistance of man, according 
to the requirements of their nature; thirdly, because of Divine 
providence, through ignorance of which the gentiles are solicitous in 
seeking temporal goods before all others. Consequently He concludes that 
we should be solicitous most of all about spiritual goods, hoping that 
temporal goods also may be granted us according to our needs, if we do 
what we ought to do.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Temporal goods are subjected to man that he may use them 
according to his needs, not that he may place his end in them and be over 
solicitous about them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The solicitude of a man who gains his bread by bodily labor 
is not superfluous but proportionate; hence Jerome says on Mt. 6:31, "Be 
not solicitous," that "labor is necessary, but solicitude must be 
banished," namely superfluous solicitude which unsettles the mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the works of mercy solicitude about temporal things is 
directed to charity as its end, wherefore it is not unlawful, unless it 
be superfluous.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether we should be solicitous about the future?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we should be solicitous about the future. For 
it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++6%3A6-8">Prov. 6:6-8</a>): "Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her 
ways and learn wisdom; which, although she hath no guide, nor master . . 
. provideth her meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth her food in 
the harvest." Now this is to be solicitous about the future. Therefore 
solicitude about the future is praiseworthy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, solicitude pertains to prudence. But prudence is chiefly 
about the future, since its principal part is "foresight of future 
things," as stated above (<A Href="SS049.html#SSQ49OUTP1">Question [49]</a>, <A Href="SS049.html#SSQ49A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 1). Therefore it is virtuous to 
be solicitous about the future.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whoever puts something by that he may keep it for the 
morrow, is solicitous about the future. Now we read (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++12%3A6">Jn. 12:6</a>) that 
Christ had a bag for keeping things in, which Judas carried, and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+4%3A34-37">Acts 4:34-37</a>) that the Apostles kept the price of the land, which had been 
laid at their feet. Therefore it is lawful to be solicitous about the 
future.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++6%3A34">Mt. 6:34</a>): "Be not . . . solicitous for 
tomorrow"; where "tomorrow" stands for the future, as Jerome says in his 
commentary on this passage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> No work can be virtuous, unless it be vested with its due 
circumstances, and among these is the due time, according to Eccles. 8:6, 
"There is a time and opportunity for every business"; which applies not 
only to external deeds but also to internal solicitude. For every time 
has its own fitting proper solicitude; thus solicitude about the crops 
belongs to the summer time, and solicitude about the vintage to the time 
of autumn. Accordingly if a man were solicitous about the vintage during 
the summer, he would be needlessly forestalling the solicitude belonging 
to a future time. Hence Our Lord forbids such like excessive solicitude, 
saying: "Be . . . not solicitous for tomorrow," wherefore He adds, "for 
the morrow will be solicitous for itself," that is to say, the morrow 
will have its own  solicitude, which will be burden enough for the soul. 
This is what He means by adding: "Sufficient for the day is the evil 
thereof," namely, the burden of solicitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The ant is solicitous at a befitting time, and it is this 
that is proposed for our example.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Due foresight of the future belongs to prudence. But it 
would be an inordinate foresight or solicitude about the future, if a man 
were to seek temporal things, to which the terms "past" and "future" 
apply, as ends, or if he were to seek them in excess of the needs of the 
present life, or if he were to forestall the time for solicitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 17), "when we 
see a servant of God taking thought lest he lack these needful things, we 
must not judge him to be solicitous for the morrow, since even Our Lord 
deigned for our example to have a purse, and we read in the Acts of the 
Apostles that they procured the necessary means of livelihood in view of 
the future on account of a threatened famine. Hence Our Lord does not 
condemn those who according to human custom, provide themselves with such 
things, but those who oppose themselves to God for the sake of these 
things."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether these vices arise from covetousness?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that these vices do not arise from covetousness. As 
stated above (<A Href="SS043.html#SSQ43OUTP1">Question [43]</a>, <A Href="SS043.html#SSQ43A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>) lust is the chief cause of lack of rectitude 
in the reason. Now these vices are opposed to right reason, i.e. to 
prudence. Therefore they arise chiefly from lust; especially since the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 6) that "Venus is full of guile and her 
girdle is many colored" and that "he who is incontinent in desire acts 
with cunning."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, these vices bear a certain resemblance to prudence, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A13THEP1">Article [13]</a>). Now, since prudence is in the reason, the 
more spiritual vices seem to be more akin thereto, such as pride and 
vainglory. Therefore the aforesaid vices seem to arise from pride rather 
than from covetousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, men make use of stratagems not only in laying hold of 
other people's goods, but also in plotting murders, the former of which 
pertains to covetousness, and the latter to anger. Now the use of 
stratagems pertains to craftiness, guile, and fraud. Therefore the 
aforesaid vices arise not only from covetousness, but also from anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45) states that fraud is a 
daughter of covetousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS055.html#SSQ55A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A13THEP1">Article [13]</a>), carnal prudence and 
craftiness, as well as guile and fraud, bear a certain resemblance to 
prudence in some kind of use of the reason. Now  among all the moral 
virtues it is justice wherein the use of right reason appears chiefly, 
for justice is in the rational appetite. Hence the undue use of reason 
appears chiefly in the vices opposed to justice, the chief of which is 
covetousness. Therefore the aforesaid vices arise chiefly from 
covetousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> On account of the vehemence of pleasure and of 
concupiscence, lust entirely suppresses the reason from exercising its 
act: whereas in the aforesaid vices there is some use of reason, albeit 
inordinate. Hence these vices do not arise directly from lust. When the 
Philosopher says that "Venus is full of guile," he is referring to a 
certain resemblance, in so far as she carries man away suddenly, just as 
he is moved in deceitful actions, yet not by means of craftiness but 
rather by the vehemence of concupiscence and pleasure; wherefore he adds 
that "Venus doth cozen the wits of the wisest man" [*Cf. Iliad xiv, 
214-217].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To do anything by stratagem seems to be due to 
pusillanimity: because a magnanimous man wishes to act openly, as the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 3). Wherefore, as pride resembles or apes 
magnanimity, it follows that the aforesaid vices which make use of fraud 
and guile, do not arise directly from pride, but rather from 
covetousness, which seeks its own profit and sets little by excellence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[55] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Anger's movement is sudden, hence it acts with 
precipitation, and without counsel, contrary to the use of the aforesaid 
vices, though these use counsel inordinately. That men use stratagems in 
plotting murders, arises not from anger but rather from hatred, because 
the angry man desires to harm manifestly, as the Philosopher states 
(Rhet. ii, 2,3) [*Cf. Ethic. vii, 6].<br>
