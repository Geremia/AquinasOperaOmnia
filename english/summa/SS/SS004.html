  <h3 align="center">OF THE VIRTUE ITSELF OF FAITH (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the virtue itself of faith, and, in the first place,
    faith itself; secondly, those who have faith; thirdly, the cause of faith;
    fourthly, its effects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:</p>
  <p><a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A1THEP1">(1)</a> What is faith?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A2THEP1">(2)</a> In what power of the soul does it
    reside?
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether its form is charity?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether living [formata] faith and
    lifeless [informis] faith are one identically?<br />
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether faith is a virtue?</p>
  <p><a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether it is one virtue?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A7THEP1">(7)</a> Of its relation to the other
    virtues;
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A8THEP1">(8)</a> Of its certitude as compared with
    the certitude of the intellectual virtues.<br />

    Whether this is a fitting definition of faith: "Faith is the substance of
    things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not?"<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Apostle gives an unfitting
    definition of faith (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A1"
      >Heb. 11:1</a
    >) when he says: "Faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the
    evidence of things that appear not." For no quality is a substance: whereas
    faith is a quality, since it is a theological virtue, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore it is
    not a substance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, different virtues have different
    objects. Now things to be hoped for are the object of hope. Therefore they
    should not be included in a definition of faith, as though they were its
    object.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, faith is perfected by charity rather
    than by hope, since charity is the form of faith, as we shall state further
    on (<a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore the
    definition of faith should have included the thing to be loved rather than
    the thing to be hoped for.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the same thing should not be placed in
    different genera. Now "substance" and "evidence" are different genera, and
    neither is subalternate to the other. Therefore it is unfitting to state
    that faith is both "substance" and "evidence."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, evidence manifests the truth of the
    matter for which it is adduced. Now a thing is said to be apparent when its
    truth is already manifest. Therefore it seems to imply a contradiction to
    speak of "evidence of things that appear not": and so faith is unfittingly
    defined.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The authority of the Apostle suffices.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Though some say that the above words of the
    Apostle are not a definition of faith, yet if we consider the matter aright,
    this definition overlooks none of the points in reference to which faith can
    be defined, albeit the words themselves are not arranged in the form of a
    definition, just as the philosophers touch on the principles of the
    syllogism, without employing the syllogistic form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to make this clear, we must observe that since habits are known by
    their acts, and acts by their objects, faith, being a habit, should be
    defined by its proper act in relation to its proper object. Now the act of
    faith is to believe, as stated above (<a href="SS002.html#SSQ2OUTP1"
      >Question [2]</a
    >, <a href="SS002.html#SSQ2ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3), which is an act of
    the intellect determinate to one object of the will's command. Hence an act
    of faith is related both to the object of the will, i.e. to the good and the
    end, and to the object of the intellect, i.e. to the true. And since faith,
    through being a theological virtues, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), has one same thing
    for object and end, its object and end must, of necessity, be in proportion
    to one another. Now it has been already stated (<a
      href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4) that the object of
    faith is the First Truth, as unseen, and whatever we hold on account
    thereof: so that it must needs be under the aspect of something unseen that
    the First Truth is the end of the act of faith, which aspect is that of a
    thing hoped for, according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A25"
      >Rm. 8:25</a
    >): "We hope for that which we see not": because to see the truth is to
    possess it. Now one hopes not for what one has already, but for what one has
    not, as stated above (FS, Question [67], Article [4]). Accordingly the
    relation of the act of faith to its end which is the object of the will, is
    indicated by the words: "Faith is the substance of things to be hoped for."
    For we are wont to call by the name of substance, the first beginning of a
    thing, especially when the whole subsequent thing is virtually contained in
    the first beginning; for instance, we might say that the first self-evident
    principles are the substance of science, because, to wit, these principles
    are in us the first beginnings of science, the whole of which is itself
    contained in them virtually. In this way then faith is said to be the
    "substance of things to be hoped for," for the reason that in us the first
    beginning of things to be hoped for is brought about by the assent of faith,
    which contains virtually all things to be hoped for. Because we hope to be
    made happy through seeing the unveiled truth to which our faith cleaves, as
    was made evident when we were speaking of happiness (<a href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS003.html#FSQ3A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>, Question [4], Article [3]).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The relationship of the act of faith to the object of the intellect,
    considered as the object of faith, is indicated by the words, "evidence of
    things that appear not," where "evidence" is taken for the result of
    evidence. For evidence induces the intellect to adhere to a truth, wherefore
    the firm adhesion of the intellect to the non-apparent truth of faith is
    called "evidence" here. Hence another reading has "conviction," because to
    wit, the intellect of the believer is convinced by Divine authority, so as
    to assent to what it sees not. Accordingly if anyone would reduce the
    foregoing words to the form of a definition, he may say that "faith is a
    habit of the mind, whereby eternal life is begun in us, making the intellect
    assent to what is non-apparent."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way faith is distinguished from all other things pertaining to the
    intellect. For when we describe it as "evidence," we distinguish it from
    opinion, suspicion, and doubt, which do not make the intellect adhere to
    anything firmly; when we go on to say, "of things that appear not," we
    distinguish it from science and understanding, the object of which is
    something apparent; and when we say that it is "the substance of things to
    be hoped for," we distinguish the virtue of faith from faith commonly so
    called, which has no reference to the beatitude we hope for.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Whatever other definitions are given of faith, are explanations of this one
    given by the Apostle. For when Augustine says (Tract. xl in Joan.:
    Questions. Evang. ii, qu. 39) that "faith is a virtue whereby we believe
    what we do not see," and when Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv, 11) that
    "faith is an assent without research," and when others say that "faith is
    that certainty of the mind about absent things which surpasses opinion but
    falls short of science," these all amount to the same as the Apostle's
    words: "Evidence of things that appear not"; and when Dionysius says (Div.
    Nom. vii) that "faith is the solid foundation of the believer, establishing
    him in the truth, and showing forth the truth in him," comes to the same as
    "substance of things to be hoped for."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> "Substance" here does not stand for the
    supreme genus condivided with the other genera, but for that likeness to
    substance which is found in each genus, inasmuch as the first thing in a
    genus contains the others virtually and is said to be the substance
    thereof.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since faith pertains to the intellect as
    commanded by the will, it must needs be directed, as to its end, to the
    objects of those virtues which perfect the will, among which is hope, as we
    shall prove further on (<a href="SS018.html#SSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="SS018.html#SSQ18A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). For this reason the
    definition of faith includes the object of hope.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Love may be of the seen and of the
    unseen, of the present and of the absent. Consequently a thing to be loved
    is not so adapted to faith, as a thing to be hoped for, since hope is always
    of the absent and the unseen.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> "Substance" and "evidence" as included
    in the definition of faith, do not denote various genera of faith, nor
    different acts, but different relationships of one act to different objects,
    as is clear from what has been said.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Evidence taken from the proper
    principles of a thing, make it apparent, whereas evidence taken from Divine
    authority does not make a thing apparent in itself, and such is the evidence
    referred to in the definition of faith.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether faith resides in the intellect?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that faith does not reside in the
    intellect. For Augustine says (De Praedest. Sanct. v) that "faith resides in
    the believer's will." Now the will is a power distinct from the intellect.
    Therefore faith does not reside in the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the assent of faith to believe anything,
    proceeds from the will obeying God. Therefore it seems that faith owes all
    its praise to obedience. Now obedience is in the will. Therefore faith is in
    the will, and not in the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the intellect is either speculative or
    practical. Now faith is not in the speculative intellect, since this is not
    concerned with things to be sought or avoided, as stated in De Anima iii, 9,
    so that it is not a principle of operation, whereas "faith... worketh by
    charity" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A6"
      >Gal. 5:6</a
    >). Likewise, neither is it in the practical intellect, the object of which
    is some true, contingent thing, that can be made or done. For the object of
    faith is the Eternal Truth, as was shown above (<a
      href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore faith does
    not reside in the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Faith is succeeded by the heavenly vision,
    according to 1 Cor. 13:12: "We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but
    then face to face." Now vision is in the intellect. Therefore faith is
    likewise.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since faith is a virtue, its act must needs be
    perfect. Now, for the perfection of an act proceeding from two active
    principles, each of these principles must be perfect: for it is not possible
    for a thing to be sawn well, unless the sawyer possess the art, and the saw
    be well fitted for sawing. Now, in a power of the soul, which is related to
    opposite objects, a disposition to act well is a habit, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS049.html#FSQ49OUTP1">Question [49]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS049.html#FSQ49A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 1,2,3).
    Wherefore an act that proceeds from two such powers must be perfected by a
    habit residing in each of them. Again, it has been stated above (<a
      href="SS002.html#SSQ2OUTP1"
      >Question [2]</a
    >, <a href="SS002.html#SSQ2ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2) that to believe is an
    act of the intellect inasmuch as the will moves it to assent. And this act
    proceeds from the will and the intellect, both of which have a natural
    aptitude to be perfected in this way. Consequently, if the act of faith is
    to be perfect, there needs to be a habit in the will as well as in the
    intellect: even as there needs to be the habit of prudence in the reason,
    besides the habit of temperance in the concupiscible faculty, in order that
    the act of that faculty be perfect. Now, to believe is immediately an act of
    the intellect, because the object of that act is "the true," which pertains
    properly to the intellect. Consequently faith, which is the proper principle
    of that act, must needs reside in the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine takes faith for the act of
    faith, which is described as depending on the believer's will, in so far as
    his intellect assents to matters of faith at the command of the will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Not only does the will need to be ready
    to obey but also the intellect needs to be well disposed to follow the
    command of the will, even as the concupiscible faculty needs to be well
    disposed in order to follow the command of reason; hence there needs to be a
    habit of virtue not only in the commanding will but also in the assenting
    intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Faith resides in the speculative
    intellect, as evidenced by its object. But since this object, which is the
    First Truth, is the end of all our desires and actions, as Augustine proves
    (De Trin. i, 8), it follows that faith worketh by charity just as "the
    speculative intellect becomes practical by extension" (De Anima iii, 10).<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether charity is the form of faith?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity is not the form of
    faith. For each thing derives its species from its form. When therefore two
    things are opposite members of a division, one cannot be the form of the
    other. Now faith and charity are stated to be opposite members of a
    division, as different species of virtue (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++13%3A13"
      >1 Cor. 13:13</a
    >). Therefore charity is not the form of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a form and the thing of which it is the
    form are in one subject, since together they form one simply. Now faith is
    in the intellect, while charity is in the will. Therefore charity is not the
    form of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the form of a thing is a principle
    thereof. Now obedience, rather than charity, seems to be the principle of
    believing, on the part of the will, according to Rm. 1:5: "For obedience to
    the faith in all nations." Therefore obedience rather than charity, is the
    form of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Each thing works through its form. Now faith
    works through charity. Therefore the love of charity is the form of
    faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As appears from what has been said above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), voluntary acts
    take their species from their end which is the will's object. Now that which
    gives a thing its species, is after the manner of a form in natural things.
    Wherefore the form of any voluntary act is, in a manner, the end to which
    that act is directed, both because it takes its species therefrom, and
    because the mode of an action should correspond proportionately to the end.
    Now it is evident from what has been said (<a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), that the act of faith is directed to the object of the will, i.e. the
    good, as to its end: and this good which is the end of faith, viz. the
    Divine Good, is the proper object of charity. Therefore charity is called
    the form of faith in so far as the act of faith is perfected and formed by
    charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Charity is called the form of faith
    because it quickens the act of faith. Now nothing hinders one act from being
    quickened by different habits, so as to be reduced to various species in a
    certain order, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,

    <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) when we were
    treating of human acts in general.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This objection is true of an intrinsic
    form. But it is not thus that charity is the form of faith, but in the sense
    that it quickens the act of faith, as explained above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even obedience, and hope likewise, and
    whatever other virtue might precede the act of faith, is quickened by
    charity, as we shall show further on (<a href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1"

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether lifeless faith can become living, or living faith, lifeless?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that lifeless faith does not become
    living, or living faith lifeless. For, according to 1 Cor. 13:10, "when that
    which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away." Now
    lifeless faith is imperfect in comparison with living faith. Therefore when
    living faith comes, lifeless faith is done away, so that they are not one
    identical habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a dead thing does not become a living
    thing. Now lifeless faith is dead, according to James 2:20: "Faith without
    works is dead." Therefore lifeless faith cannot become living.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God's grace, by its advent, has no less
    effect in a believer than in an unbeliever. Now by coming to an unbeliever
    it causes the habit of faith. Therefore when it comes to a believer, who
    hitherto had the habit of lifeless faith, it causes another habit of faith
    in him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, as Boethius says (In Categ. Arist. i),
    "accidents cannot be altered." Now faith is an accident. Therefore the same
    faith cannot be at one time living, and at another, lifeless.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on the words, "Faith without works is
    dead" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+2%3A20"
      >James 2:20</a
    >) adds, "by which it lives once more." Therefore faith which was lifeless
    and without form hitherto, becomes formed and living.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There have been various opinions on this
    question. For some [*William of Auxerre, Sum. Aur. III, iii, 15] have said
    that living and lifeless faith are distinct habits, but that when living
    faith comes, lifeless faith is done away, and that, in like manner, when a
    man sins mortally after having living faith, a new habit of lifeless faith
    is infused into him by God. But it seems unfitting that grace should deprive
    man of a gift of God by coming to him, and that a gift of God should be
    infused into man, on account of a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Consequently others [*Alexander of Hales, Sum. Theol. iii, 64] have said
    that living and lifeless faith are indeed distinct habits, but that, all the
    same, when living faith comes the habit of lifeless faith is not taken away,
    and that it remains together with the habit of living faith in the same
    subject. Yet again it seems unreasonable that the habit of lifeless faith
    should remain inactive in a person having living faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We must therefore hold differently that living and lifeless faith are one
    and the same habit. The reason is that a habit is differentiated by that
    which directly pertains to that habit. Now since faith is a perfection of
    the intellect, that pertains directly to faith, which pertains to the
    intellect. Again, what pertains to the will, does not pertain directly to
    faith, so as to be able to differentiate the habit of faith. But the
    distinction of living from lifeless faith is in respect of something
    pertaining to the will, i.e. charity, and not in respect of something
    pertaining to the intellect. Therefore living and lifeless faith are not
    distinct habits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The saying of the Apostle refers to
    those imperfect things from which imperfection is inseparable, for then,
    when the perfect comes the imperfect must needs be done away. Thus with the
    advent of clear vision, faith is done away, because it is essentially "of
    the things that appear not." When, however, imperfection is not inseparable
    from the imperfect thing, the same identical thing which was imperfect
    becomes perfect. Thus childhood is not essential to man and consequently the
    same identical subject who was a child, becomes a man. Now lifelessness is
    not essential to faith, but is accidental thereto as stated above. Therefore
    lifeless faith itself becomes living.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That which makes an animal live is
    inseparable from an animal, because it is its substantial form, viz. the
    soul: consequently a dead thing cannot become a living thing, and a living
    and a dead thing differ specifically. On the other hand that which gives
    faith its form, or makes it live, is not essential to faith. Hence there is
    no comparison.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Grace causes faith not only when faith
    begins anew to be in a man, but also as long as faith lasts. For it has been
    said above (FP, Question [104], Article [1]; FS, Question [109], Article
    [9]) that God is always working man's justification, even as the sun is
    always lighting up the air. Hence grace is not less effective when it comes
    to a believer than when it comes to an unbeliever: since it causes faith in
    both, in the former by confirming and perfecting it, in the latter by
    creating it anew.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We might also reply that it is accidental, namely on account of the
    disposition of the subject, that grace does not cause faith in one who has
    it already: just as, on the other hand, a second mortal sin does not take
    away grace from one who has already lost it through a previous mortal
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> When living faith becomes lifeless,
    faith is not changed, but its subject, the soul, which at one time has faith
    without charity, and at another time, with charity.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether faith is a virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that faith is not a virtue. For
    virtue is directed to the good, since "it is virtue that makes its subject
    good," as the Philosopher states (Ethic. ii, 6). But faith is directed to
    the true. Therefore faith is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, infused virtue is more perfect than
    acquired virtue. Now faith, on account of its imperfection, is not placed
    among the acquired intellectual virtues, as the Philosopher states (Ethic.
    vi, 3). Much less, therefore, can it be considered an infused virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, living and lifeless faith are the same
    species, as stated above (<a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).
    Now lifeless faith is not a virtue, since it is not connected with the other
    virtues. Therefore neither is living faith a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the gratuitous graces and the fruits are
    distinct from the virtues. But faith is numbered among the gratuitous graces
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++12%3A9"
      >1 Cor. 12:9</a
    >) and likewise among the fruits (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A23"
      >Gal. 5:23</a
    >). Therefore faith is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Man is justified by the virtues, since
    "justice is all virtue," as the Philosopher states (Ethic. v, 1). Now man is
    justified by faith according to Rm. 5:1: "Being justified therefore by faith
    let us have peace," etc. Therefore faith is a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As shown above, it is by human virtue that
    human acts are rendered good; hence, any habit that is always the principle
    of a good act, may be called a human virtue. Such a habit is living faith.
    For since to believe is an act of the intellect assenting to the truth at
    the command of the will, two things are required that this act may be
    perfect: one of which is that the intellect should infallibly tend to its
    object, which is the true; while the other is that the will should be
    infallibly directed to the last end, on account of which it assents to the
    true: and both of these are to be found in the act of living faith. For it
    belongs to the very essence of faith that the intellect should ever tend to
    the true, since nothing false can be the object of faith, as proved above
    (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): while the effect of
    charity, which is the form of faith, is that the soul ever has its will
    directed to a good end. Therefore living faith is a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, lifeless faith is not a virtue, because, though the act
    of lifeless faith is duly perfect on the part of the intellect, it has not
    its due perfection as regards the will: just as if temperance be in the
    concupiscible, without prudence being in the rational part, temperance is
    not a virtue, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), because the act of
    temperance requires both an act of reason, and an act of the concupiscible
    faculty, even as the act of faith requires an act of the will, and an act of
    the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The truth is itself the good of the
    intellect, since it is its perfection: and consequently faith has a relation
    to some good in so far as it directs the intellect to the true. Furthermore,
    it has a relation to the good considered as the object of the will, inasmuch
    as it is formed by charity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The faith of which the Philosopher
    speaks is based on human reasoning in a conclusion which does not follow, of
    necessity, from its premisses; and which is subject to be false: hence such
    like faith is not a virtue. On the other hand, the faith of which we are
    speaking is based on the Divine Truth, which is infallible, and consequently
    its object cannot be anything false; so that faith of this kind can be a
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Living and lifeless faith do not differ
    specifically, as though they belonged to different species. But they differ
    as perfect and imperfect within the same species. Hence lifeless faith,
    being imperfect, does not satisfy the conditions of a perfect virtue, for
    "virtue is a kind of perfection" (Phys. vii, text. 18).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Some say that faith which is numbered
    among the gratuitous graces is lifeless faith. But this is said without
    reason, since the gratuitous graces, which are mentioned in that passage,
    are not common to all the members of the Church: wherefore the Apostle says:
    "There are diversities of graces," and again, "To one is given" this grace
    and "to another" that. Now lifeless faith is common to all members of the
    Church, because its lifelessness is not part of its substance, if we
    consider it as a gratuitous gift. We must, therefore, say that in that
    passage, faith denotes a certain excellency of faith, for instance,
    "constancy in faith," according to a gloss, or the "word of faith."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Faith is numbered among the fruits, in so far as it gives a certain pleasure
    in its act by reason of its certainty, wherefore the gloss on the fifth
    chapter to the Galatians, where the fruits are enumerated, explains faith as
    being "certainty about the unseen."<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether faith is one virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that faith is not one. For just as
    faith is a gift of God according to Eph. 2:8, so also wisdom and knowledge
    are numbered among God's gifts according to Is. 11:2. Now wisdom and
    knowledge differ in this, that wisdom is about eternal things, and knowledge
    about temporal things, as Augustine states (De Trin. xii, 14,15). Since,
    then, faith is about eternal things, and also about some temporal things, it
    seems that faith is not one virtue, but divided into several parts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, confession is an act of faith, as stated
    above (<a href="SS003.html#SSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="SS003.html#SSQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now confession of faith
    is not one and the same for all: since what we confess as past, the fathers
    of old confessed as yet to come, as appears from Is. 7:14: "Behold a virgin
    shall conceive." Therefore faith is not one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, faith is common to all believers in
    Christ. But one accident cannot be in many subjects. Therefore all cannot
    have one faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++4%3A5"
      >Eph. 4:5</a
    >): "One Lord, one faith."
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> If we take faith as a habit, we can consider it
    in two ways. First on the part of the object, and thus there is one faith.
    Because the formal object of faith is the First Truth, by adhering to which
    we believe whatever is contained in the faith. Secondly, on the part of the
    subject, and thus faith is differentiated according as it is in various
    subjects. Now it is evident that faith, just as any other habit, takes its
    species from the formal aspect of its object, but is individualized by its
    subject. Hence if we take faith for the habit whereby we believe, it is one
    specifically, but differs numerically according to its various subjects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, on the other hand, we take faith for that which is believed, then,
    again, there is one faith, since what is believed by all is one same thing:
    for though the things believed, which all agree in believing, be diverse
    from one another, yet they are all reduced to one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Temporal matters which are proposed to
    be believed, do not belong to the object of faith, except in relation to
    something eternal, viz. the First Truth, as stated above (<a
      href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence there is one
    faith of things both temporal and eternal. It is different with wisdom and
    knowledge, which consider temporal and eternal matters under their
    respective aspects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This difference of past and future
    arises, not from any difference in the thing believed, but from the
    different relationships of believers to the one thing believed, as also we
    have mentioned above (FS, Question [103], Article [4]; FS, Question [107],
    Article [1], ad 1).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This objection considers numerical
    diversity of faith.

  <h3 align="left">Whether faith is the first of the virtues?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that faith is not the first of the
    virtues. For a gloss on Lk. 12:4, "I say to you My friends," says that
    fortitude is the foundation of faith. Now the foundation precedes that which
    is founded thereon. Therefore faith is not the first of the virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a gloss on Ps. 36, "Be not emulous,"
    says that hope "leads on to faith." Now hope is a virtue, as we shall state
    further on (<a href="SS017.html#SSQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>,
    <a href="SS017.html#SSQ17A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore faith is not
    the first of the virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it was stated above (<a
      href="SS004.html#SSQ4A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >) that the intellect of the believer is moved, out of obedience to God, to
    assent to matters of faith. Now obedience also is a virtue. Therefore faith
    is not the first virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, not lifeless but living faith is the
    foundation, as a gloss remarks on 1 Cor. 3:11 [*Augustine, De Fide et Oper.
    xvi.]. Now faith is formed by charity, as stated above (<a
      href="SS004.html#SSQ4A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >). Therefore it is owing to charity that faith is the foundation: so that
    charity is the foundation yet more than faith is (for the foundation is the
    first part of a building) and consequently it seems to precede faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the order of habits is taken from the
    order of acts. Now, in the act of faith, the act of the will which is
    perfected by charity, precedes the act of the intellect, which is perfected
    by faith, as the cause which precedes its effect. Therefore charity precedes
    faith. Therefore faith is not the first of the virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A1"
      >Heb. 11:1</a
    >) that "faith is the substance of things to be hoped for." Now the
    substance of a thing is that which comes first. Therefore faith is first
    among the virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> One thing can precede another in two ways:
    first, by its very nature; secondly, by accident. Faith, by its very nature,
    precedes all other virtues. For since the end is the principle in matters of
    action, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS013.html#FSQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS013.html#FSQ13A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS034.html#FSQ34OUTP1">Question [34]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS034.html#FSQ34A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 1), the
    theological virtues, the object of which is the last end, must needs precede
    all the others. Again, the last end must of necessity be present to the
    intellect before it is present to the will, since the will has no
    inclination for anything except in so far as it is apprehended by the
    intellect. Hence, as the last end is present in the will by hope and
    charity, and in the intellect, by faith, the first of all the virtues must,
    of necessity, be faith, because natural knowledge cannot reach God as the
    object of heavenly bliss, which is the aspect under which hope and charity
    tend towards Him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, some virtues can precede faith accidentally. For an
    accidental cause precedes its effect accidentally. Now that which removes an
    obstacle is a kind of accidental cause, according to the Philosopher (Phys.
    viii, 4): and in this sense certain virtues may be said to precede faith
    accidentally, in so far as they remove obstacles to belief. Thus fortitude
    removes the inordinate fear that hinders faith; humility removes pride,
    whereby a man refuses to submit himself to the truth of faith. The same may
    be said of some other virtues, although there are no real virtues, unless
    faith be presupposed, as Augustine states (Contra Julian. iv, 3).<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Hope cannot lead to faith absolutely.
    For one cannot hope to obtain eternal happiness, unless one believes this
    possible, since hope does not tend to the impossible, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a

    <a href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). It is, however,
    possible for one to be led by hope to persevere in faith, or to hold firmly
    to faith; and it is in this sense that hope is said to lead to faith.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Obedience is twofold: for sometimes it
    denotes the inclination of the will to fulfil God's commandments. In this
    way it is not a special virtue, but is a general condition of every virtue;
    since all acts of virtue come under the precepts of the Divine law, as
    stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS100.html#FSQ100OUTP1">Question [100]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS100.html#FSQ100A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); and thus it is
    requisite for faith. In another way, obedience denotes an inclination to
    fulfil the commandments considered as a duty. In this way it is a special
    virtue, and a part of justice: for a man does his duty by his superior when
    he obeys him: and thus obedience follows faith, whereby man knows that God
    is his superior, Whom he must obey.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> To be a foundation a thing requires not
    only to come first, but also to be connected with the other parts of the
    building: since the building would not be founded on it unless the other
    parts adhered to it. Now the connecting bond of the spiritual edifice is
    charity, according to Col. 3:14: "Above all... things have charity which is
    the bond of perfection." Consequently faith without charity cannot be the
    foundation: and yet it does not follow that charity precedes faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Some act of the will is required before
    faith, but not an act of the will quickened by charity. This latter act
    presupposes faith, because the will cannot tend to God with perfect love,
    unless the intellect possesses right faith about Him.<br />

    Whether faith is more certain than science and the other intellectual
    virtues?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that faith is not more certain than
    science and the other intellectual virtues. For doubt is opposed to
    certitude, wherefore a thing would seem to be the more certain, through
    being less doubtful, just as a thing is the whiter, the less it has of an
    admixture of black. Now understanding, science and also wisdom are free of
    any doubt about their objects; whereas the believer may sometimes suffer a
    movement of doubt, and doubt about matters of faith. Therefore faith is no
    more certain than the intellectual virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sight is more certain than hearing. But
    "faith is through hearing" according to Rm. 10:17; whereas understanding,
    science and wisdom imply some kind of intellectual sight. Therefore science
    and understanding are more certain than faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, in matters concerning the intellect, the more perfect is the more
    certain. Now understanding is more perfect than faith, since faith is the
    way to understanding, according to another version [*The Septuagint] of Is.
    7:9: "If you will not believe, you shall not understand [Vulg.:
    'continue']": and Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 1) that "faith is
    strengthened by science." Therefore it seems that science or understanding
    is more certain than faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Thess++2%3A15"
      >1 Thess. 2:15</a
    >): "When you had received of us the word of the hearing," i.e. by faith...
    "you received it not as the word of men, but, as it is indeed, the word of
    God." Now nothing is more certain than the word of God. Therefore science is
    not more certain than faith; nor is anything else.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS057.html#FSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS057.html#FSQ57A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 2) two of the
    intellectual virtues are about contingent matter, viz. prudence and art; to
    which faith is preferable in point of certitude, by reason of its matter,
    since it is about eternal things, which never change, whereas the other
    three intellectual virtues, viz. wisdom, science [*In English the
    corresponding 'gift' is called knowledge] and understanding, are about
    necessary things, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS057.html#FSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS057.html#FSQ57A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 3). But it must
    be observed that wisdom, science and understanding may be taken in two ways:
    first, as intellectual virtues, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi,
    2,3); secondly, for the gifts of the Holy Ghost. If we consider them in the
    first way, we must note that certitude can be looked at in two ways. First,
    on the part of its cause, and thus a thing which has a more certain cause,
    is itself more certain. In this way faith is more certain than those three
    virtues, because it is founded on the Divine truth, whereas the aforesaid
    three virtues are based on human reason. Secondly, certitude may be
    considered on the part of the subject, and thus the more a man's intellect
    lays hold of a thing, the more certain it is. In this way, faith is less
    certain, because matters of faith are above the human intellect, whereas the
    objects of the aforesaid three virtues are not. Since, however, a thing is
    judged simply with regard to its cause, but relatively, with respect to a
    disposition on the part of the subject, it follows that faith is more
    certain simply, while the others are more certain relatively, i.e. for us.
    Likewise if these three be taken as gifts received in this present life,
    they are related to faith as to their principle which they presuppose: so
    that again, in this way, faith is more certain.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This doubt is not on the side of the
    cause of faith, but on our side, in so far as we do not fully grasp matters
    of faith with our intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Other things being equal sight is more
    certain than hearing; but if (the authority of) the person from whom we hear
    greatly surpasses that of the seer's sight, hearing is more certain than
    sight: thus a man of little science is more certain about what he hears on
    the authority of an expert in science, than about what is apparent to him
    according to his own reason: and much more is a man certain about what he
    hears from God, Who cannot be deceived, than about what he sees with his own
    reason, which can be mistaken.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The gifts of understanding and knowledge
    are more perfect than the knowledge of faith in the point of their greater
    clearness, but not in regard to more certain adhesion: because the whole
    certitude of the gifts of understanding and knowledge, arises from the
    certitude of faith, even as the certitude of the knowledge of conclusions
    arises from the certitude of premisses. But in so far as science, wisdom and
    understanding are intellectual virtues, they are based upon the natural
    light of reason, which falls short of the certitude of God's word, on which
    faith is founded.<br />
