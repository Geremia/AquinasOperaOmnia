<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that peace is the same as concord. For Augustine 
says (De Civ. Dei xix, 13): "Peace among men is well ordered concord." 
Now we are speaking here of no other peace than that of men. Therefore 
peace is the same as concord.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, concord is union of wills. Now the nature of peace 
consists in such like union, for Dionysius says (Div. Nom. xi) that peace 
unites all, and makes them of one mind. Therefore peace is the same as 
concord.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things whose opposites are identical are themselves 
identical. Now the one same thing is opposed to concord and peace, viz. 
dissension; hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++16%3A33">1 Cor. 16:33</a>): "God is not the God of 
dissension but of peace." Therefore peace is the same as concord.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> There can be concord in evil between wicked men. But 
"there is no peace to the wicked" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++48%3A22">Is. 48:22</a>). Therefore peace is not the 
same as concord.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Peace includes concord and adds something thereto. Hence 
wherever peace is, there is concord, but there is not peace, wherever 
there is concord, if we give peace its proper meaning.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For concord, properly speaking, is between one man and another, in so 
far as the wills of various hearts agree together in consenting to the 
same thing. Now the heart of one man may happen to tend to diverse 
things, and this in two ways. First, in respect of the diverse appetitive 
powers: thus the sensitive appetite tends sometimes to that which is 
opposed to the rational appetite, according to Gal. 5:17: "The flesh 
lusteth against the spirit." Secondly, in so far as one and the same 
appetitive power tends to diverse objects of appetite, which it cannot 
obtain all at the same time: so that there must needs be a clashing of 
the movements of the appetite. Now the union of such movements is 
essential to peace, because man's heart is not at peace, so long as he 
has not what he wants, or if, having what he wants, there still remains 
something for him to want, and which he cannot have at the same time. On 
the other hand this union is not essential to concord: wherefore concord 
denotes union of appetites among various persons, while peace denotes, in 
addition to this union, the union of the appetites even in one man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine is speaking there of that peace which is between 
one man and another, and he says that this peace is concord, not indeed 
any kind of concord, but that which is well ordered, through one man 
agreeing with another in respect of something befitting to both of them . 
For if one man concord with another, not of his own accord, but through 
being forced, as it were, by the fear of some evil that besets him, such 
concord is not really peace, because the order of each concordant is not 
observed, but is disturbed by some fear-inspiring cause. For this reason 
he premises that "peace is tranquillity of order," which tranquillity 
consists in all the appetitive movements in one man being set at rest 
together.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If one man consent to the same thing together with another 
man, his consent is nevertheless not perfectly united to himself, unless 
at the same time all his appetitive movements be in agreement.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A twofold dissension is opposed to peace, namely dissension 
between a man and himself, and dissension between one  man and another. 
The latter alone is opposed to concord.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether all things desire peace?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not all things desire peace. For, according to 
Dionysius (Div. Nom. xi), peace "unites consent." But there cannot be 
unity of consent in things which are devoid of knowledge. Therefore such 
things cannot desire peace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the appetite does not tend to opposite things at the 
same time. Now many desire war and dissension. Therefore all men do not 
desire peace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, good alone is an object of appetite. But a certain peace 
is, seemingly, evil, else Our Lord would not have said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++10%3A34">Mt. 10:34</a>): "I 
came not to send peace." Therefore all things do not desire peace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, that which all desire is, seemingly, the sovereign good 
which is the last end. But this is not true of peace, since it is 
attainable even by a wayfarer; else Our Lord would vainly command (Mk. 
9:49): "Have peace among you." Therefore all things do not desire peace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 12,14) that "all 
things desire peace": and Dionysius says the same (Div. Nom. xi).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> From the very fact that a man desires a certain thing it 
follows that he desires to obtain what he desires, and, in consequence, 
to remove whatever may be an obstacle to his obtaining it. Now a man may 
be hindered from obtaining the good he desires, by a contrary desire 
either of his own or of some other, and both are removed by peace, as 
stated above. Hence it follows of necessity that whoever desires anything 
desires peace, in so far as he who desires anything, desires to attain, 
with tranquillity and without hindrance, to that which he desires: and 
this is what is meant by peace which Augustine defines (De Civ. Dei xix, 
13) "the tranquillity of order."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Peace denotes union not only of the intellective or 
rational appetite, or of the animal appetite, in both of which consent 
may be found, but also of the natural appetite. Hence Dionysius says that 
"peace is the cause of consent and of connaturalness," where "consent" 
denotes the union of appetites proceeding from knowledge, and 
"connaturalness," the union of natural appetites.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even those who seek war and dissension, desire nothing but 
peace, which they deem themselves not to have. For as we stated above, 
there is no peace when a man concords with another man counter to what he 
would prefer. Consequently men seek by means of war to break this 
concord, because it is a defective peace, in  order that they may obtain 
peace, where nothing is contrary to their will. Hence all wars are waged 
that men may find a more perfect peace than that which they had 
heretofore.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Peace gives calm and unity to the appetite. Now just as the 
appetite may tend to what is good simply, or to what is good apparently, 
so too, peace may be either true or apparent. There can be no true peace 
except where the appetite is directed to what is truly good, since every 
evil, though it may appear good in a way, so as to calm the appetite in 
some respect, has, nevertheless many defects, which cause the appetite to 
remain restless and disturbed. Hence true peace is only in good men and 
about good things. The peace of the wicked is not a true peace but a 
semblance thereof, wherefore it is written (Wis. 14:22): "Whereas they 
lived in a great war of ignorance, they call so many and so great evils 
peace."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Since true peace is only about good things, as the true 
good is possessed in two ways, perfectly and imperfectly, so there is a 
twofold true peace. One is perfect peace. It consists in the perfect 
enjoyment of the sovereign good, and unites all one's desires by giving 
them rest in one object. This is the last end of the rational creature, 
according to Ps. 147:3: "Who hath placed peace in thy borders." The other 
is imperfect peace, which may be had in this world, for though the chief 
movement of the soul finds rest in God, yet there are certain things 
within and without which disturb the peace.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether peace is the proper effect of charity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that peace is not the proper effect of charity. For 
one cannot have charity without sanctifying grace. But some have peace 
who have not sanctifying grace, thus heathens sometimes have peace. 
Therefore peace is not the effect of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if a certain thing is caused by charity, its contrary is 
not compatible with charity. But dissension, which is contrary to peace, 
is compatible with charity, for we find that even holy doctors, such as 
Jerome and Augustine, dissented in some of their opinions. We also read 
that Paul and Barnabas dissented from one another (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+15">Acts 15</a>). Therefore it 
seems that peace is not the effect of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same thing is not the proper effect of different 
things. Now peace is the effect of justice, according to Is. 32:17: "And 
the work of justice shall be peace." Therefore it is not the effect of 
charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++118%3A165">Ps. 118:165</a>): "Much peace have they that 
love Thy Law."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Peace implies a twofold union, as stated above (<A Href="SS029.html#SSQ29A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
The first is the result of one's own appetites being directed  to one 
object; while the other results from one's own appetite being united with 
the appetite of another: and each of these unions is effected by 
charity---the first, in so far as man loves God with his whole heart, by 
referring all things to Him, so that all his desires tend to one 
object---the second, in so far as we love our neighbor as ourselves, the 
result being that we wish to fulfil our neighbor's will as though it were 
ours: hence it is reckoned a sign of friendship if people "make choice of 
the same things" (Ethic. ix, 4), and Tully says (De Amicitia) that 
friends "like and dislike the same things" (Sallust, Catilin.)<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Without sin no one falls from a state of sanctifying grace, 
for it turns man away from his due end by making him place his end in 
something undue: so that his appetite does not cleave chiefly to the true 
final good, but to some apparent good. Hence, without sanctifying grace, 
peace is not real but merely apparent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Ethic. ix, 6) friends need not 
agree in opinion, but only upon such goods as conduce to life, and 
especially upon such as are important; because dissension in small 
matters is scarcely accounted dissension. Hence nothing hinders those who 
have charity from holding different opinions. Nor is this an obstacle to 
peace, because opinions concern the intellect, which precedes the 
appetite that is united by peace. In like manner if there be concord as 
to goods of importance, dissension with regard to some that are of little 
account is not contrary to charity: for such a dissension proceeds from a 
difference of opinion, because one man thinks that the particular good, 
which is the object of dissension, belongs to the good about which they 
agree, while the other thinks that it does not. Accordingly such like 
dissension about very slight matters and about opinions is inconsistent 
with a state of perfect peace, wherein the truth will be known fully, and 
every desire fulfilled; but it is not inconsistent with the imperfect 
peace of the wayfarer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Peace is the "work of justice" indirectly, in so far as 
justice removes the obstacles to peace: but it is the work of charity 
directly, since charity, according to its very nature, causes peace. For 
love is "a unitive force" as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv): and peace is 
the union of the appetite's inclinations.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether peace is a virtue?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that peace is a virtue. For nothing is a matter of 
precept, unless it be an act of virtue. But there are precepts about 
keeping peace, for example: "Have peace among you" (Mk. 9:49). Therefore 
peace is a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we do not merit except by acts of virtue. Now it is 
meritorious to keep peace, according to Mt. 5:9: "Blessed are the 
peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God."  Therefore 
peace is a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, vices are opposed to virtues. But dissensions, which are 
contrary to peace, are numbered among the vices (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5%3A20">Gal. 5:20</a>). Therefore 
peace is a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Virtue is not the last end, but the way thereto. But 
peace is the last end, in a sense, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 
11). Therefore peace is not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS028.html#SSQ28OUTP1">Question [28]</a>, <A Href="SS028.html#SSQ28A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), when a number of acts all 
proceeding uniformly from an agent, follow one from the other, they all 
arise from the same virtue, nor do they each have a virtue from which 
they proceed, as may be seen in corporeal things. For, though fire by 
heating, both liquefies and rarefies, there are not two powers in fire, 
one of liquefaction, the other of rarefaction: and fire produces all such 
actions by its own power of calefaction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then charity causes peace precisely because it is love of God and 
of our neighbor, as shown above (<A Href="SS029.html#SSQ29A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), there is no other virtue except 
charity whose proper act is peace, as we have also said in reference to 
joy (<A Href="SS028.html#SSQ28OUTP1">Question [28]</a>, <A Href="SS028.html#SSQ28A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We are commanded to keep peace because it is an act of 
charity; and for this reason too it is a meritorious act. Hence it is 
placed among the beatitudes, which are acts of perfect virtue, as stated 
above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS069.html#FSQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS069.html#FSQ69ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3). It is also numbered among the fruits, in so 
far as it is a final good, having spiritual sweetness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[29] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Several vices are opposed to one virtue in respect of its 
various acts: so that not only is hatred opposed to charity, in respect 
of its act which is love, but also sloth and envy, in respect of joy, and 
dissension in respect of peace.<br>
