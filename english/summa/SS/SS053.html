  <h3 align="center">OF IMPRUDENCE (SIX ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the vices opposed to prudence. For Augustine says
    (Contra Julian. iv, 3): "There are vices opposed to every virtue, not only
    vices that are in manifest opposition to virtue, as temerity is opposed to
    prudence, but also vices which have a kind of kinship and not a true but a
    spurious likeness to virtue; thus in opposition to prudence we have
    craftiness."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly we must consider first of all those vices which are in evident
    opposition to prudence, those namely which are due to a defect either of
    prudence or of those things which are requisite for prudence, and secondly
    those vices which have a false resemblance to prudence, those namely which
    are due to abuse of the things required for prudence. And since solicitude
    pertains to prudence, the first of these considerations will be twofold: (1)
    Of imprudence; (2) Of negligence which is opposed to solicitude.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are six points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS053.html#SSQ53A1THEP1">(1)</a> Concerning imprudence, whether it
    is a sin?
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS053.html#SSQ53A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a special sin?</p>
  <p><a href="SS053.html#SSQ53A3THEP1">(3)</a> Of precipitation or temerity;</p>
  <p><a href="SS053.html#SSQ53A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of thoughtlessness;</p>
  <p><a href="SS053.html#SSQ53A5THEP1">(5)</a> Of inconstancy;</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS053.html#SSQ53A6THEP1">(6)</a> Concerning the origin of these
    vices.

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether imprudence is a sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that imprudence is not a sin. For
    every sin is voluntary, according to Augustine [*De Vera Relig. xiv];
    whereas imprudence is not voluntary, since no man wishes to be imprudent.
    Therefore imprudence is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, none but original sin comes to man with
    his birth. But imprudence comes to man with his birth, wherefore the young
    are imprudent; and yet it is not original sin which is opposed to original
    justice. Therefore imprudence is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every sin is taken away by repentance.
    But imprudence is not taken away by repentance. Therefore imprudence is not
    a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The spiritual treasure of grace is not taken
    away save by sin. But it is taken away by imprudence, according to Prov.
    21:20, "There is a treasure to be desired, and oil in the dwelling of the
    just, and the imprudent [Douay: 'foolish'] man shall spend it." Therefore
    imprudence is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Imprudence may be taken in two ways, first, as
    a privation, secondly, as a contrary. Properly speaking it is not taken as a
    negation, so as merely to signify the absence of prudence, for this can be
    without any sin. Taken as a privation, imprudence denotes lack of that
    prudence which a man can and ought to have, and in this sense imprudence is
    a sin by reason of a man's negligence in striving to have prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Imprudence is taken as a contrary, in so far as the movement or act of
    reason is in opposition to prudence: for instance, whereas the right reason
    of prudence acts by taking counsel, the imprudent man despises counsel, and
    the same applies to the other conditions which require consideration in the
    act of prudence. In this way imprudence is a sin in respect of prudence
    considered under its proper aspect, since it is not possible for a man to
    act against prudence, except by infringing the rules on which the right
    reason of prudence depends. Wherefore, if this should happen through
    aversion from the Divine Law, it will be a mortal sin, as when a man acts
    precipitately through contempt and rejection of the Divine teaching: whereas
    if he act beside the Law and without contempt, and without detriment to
    things necessary for salvation, it will be a venial sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> No man desires the deformity of
    imprudence, but the rash man wills the act of imprudence, because he wishes
    to act precipitately. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 5) that "he who
    sins willingly against prudence is less to be commended."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument takes imprudence in the
    negative sense. It must be observed however that lack of prudence or of any
    other virtue is included in the lack of original justice which perfected the
    entire soul. Accordingly all such lack of virtue may be ascribed to original
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Repentance restores infused prudence,
    and thus the lack of this prudence ceases; but acquired prudence is not
    restored as to the habit, although the contrary act is taken away, wherein
    properly speaking the sin of imprudence consists.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether imprudence is a special sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that imprudence is not a special
    sin. For whoever sins, acts against right reason, i.e. against prudence. But
    imprudence consists in acting against prudence, as stated above (<a
      href="SS053.html#SSQ53A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Therefore imprudence is not a special sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prudence is more akin to moral action
    than knowledge is. But ignorance which is opposed to knowledge, is reckoned
    one of the general causes of sin. Much more therefore should imprudence be
    reckoned among those causes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sin consists in the corruption of the
    circumstances of virtue, wherefore Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that "evil
    results from each single defect." Now many things are requisite for
    prudence; for instance, reason, intelligence docility, and so on, as stated
    above (<a href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [48]</a>,49). Therefore there
    are many species of imprudence, so that it is not a special sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Imprudence is opposed to prudence, as stated
    above (<a href="SS053.html#SSQ53A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now prudence is a
    special virtue. Therefore imprudence too is one special vice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A vice or sin may be styled general in two
    ways; first, absolutely, because, to wit, it is general in respect of all
    sins; secondly, because it is general in respect of certain vices, which are
    its species. In the first way, a vice may be said to be general on two
    counts: first, essentially, because it is predicated of all sins: and in
    this way imprudence is not a general sin, as neither is prudence a general
    virtue: since it is concerned with special acts, namely the very acts of
    reason: secondly, by participation; and in this way imprudence is a general
    sin: for, just as all the virtues have a share of prudence, in so far as it
    directs them, so have all vices and sins a share of imprudence, because no
    sin can occur, without some defect in an act of the directing reason, which
    defect belongs to imprudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, on the other hand, a sin be called general, not simply but in some
    particular genus, that is, as containing several species of sin, then
    imprudence is a general sin. For it contains various species in three ways.
    First, by opposition to the various subjective parts of prudence, for just
    as we distinguish the prudence that guides the individual, from other kinds
    that govern communities, as stated above (<a href="SS048.html#SSQ48OUTP1"
      >Question [48]</a
    >; <a href="SS050.html#SSQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>,
    <a href="SS050.html#SSQ50A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), so also we distinguish
    various kinds of imprudence. Secondly, in respect of the quasi-potential
    parts of prudence, which are virtues connected with it, and correspond to
    the several acts of reason. Thus, by defect of "counsel" to which {euboulia}
    (deliberating well) corresponds, "precipitation" or "temerity" is a species
    of imprudence; by defect of "judgment," to which {synesis} (judging well
    according to common law) and {gnome} (judging well according to general law)
    refer, there is "thoughtlessness"; while "inconstancy" and "negligence"
    correspond to the "command" which is the proper act of prudence. Thirdly,
    this may be taken by opposition to those things which are requisite for
    prudence, which are the quasi-integral parts of prudence. Since however all
    these things are intended for the direction of the aforesaid three acts of
    reason, it follows that all the opposite defects are reducible to the four
    parts mentioned above. Thus incautiousness and incircumspection are included
    in "thoughtlessness"; lack of docility, memory, or reason is referable to
    "precipitation"; improvidence, lack of intelligence and of shrewdness,
    belong to "negligence" and "inconstancy."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument considers generality by
    participation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since knowledge is further removed from
    morality than prudence is, according to their respective proper natures, it
    follows that ignorance has the nature of mortal sin, not of itself, but on
    account either of a preceding negligence, or of the consequent result, and
    for this reason it is reckoned one of the general causes of sin. On the
    other hand imprudence, by its very nature, denotes a moral vice; and for
    this reason it can be called a special sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When various circumstances are corrupted
    for the same motive, the species of sin is not multiplied: thus it is the
    same species of sin to take what is not one's own, where one ought not, and
    when one ought not. If, however, there be various motives, there are various
    species: for instance, if one man were to take another's property from where
    he ought not, so as to wrong a sacred place, this would constitute the
    species called sacrilege, while if another were to take another's property
    when he ought not, merely through the lust of possession, this would be a
    case of simple avarice. Hence the lack of those things which are requisite
    for prudence, does not constitute a diversity of species, except in so far
    as they are directed to different acts of reason, as stated above.<br />

    Whether precipitation is a sin included in imprudence?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that precipitation is not a sin
    included in imprudence. Imprudence is opposed to the virtue of prudence;
    whereas precipitation is opposed to the gift of counsel, according to
    Gregory, who says (Moral. ii, 49) that the gift of "counsel is given as a
    remedy to precipitation." Therefore precipitation is not a sin contained
    under imprudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, precipitation seemingly pertains to
    rashness. Now rashness implies presumption, which pertains to pride.
    Therefore precipitation is not a vice contained under imprudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, precipitation seems to denote inordinate
    haste. Now sin happens in counselling not only through being over hasty but
    also through being over slow, so that the opportunity for action passes by,
    and through corruption of other circumstances, as stated in Ethic. vi, 9.
    Therefore there is no reason for reckoning precipitation as a sin contained
    under imprudence, rather than slowness, or something else of the kind
    pertaining to inordinate counsel.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++4%3A19"
      >Prov. 4:19</a
    >): "The way of the wicked is darksome, they know not where they fall." Now
    the darksome ways of ungodliness belong to imprudence. Therefore imprudence
    leads a man to fall or to be precipitate.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Precipitation is ascribed metaphorically to
    acts of the soul, by way of similitude to bodily movement. Now a thing is
    said to be precipitated as regards bodily movement, when it is brought down
    from above by the impulse either of its own movement or of another's, and
    not in orderly fashion by degrees. Now the summit of the soul is the reason,
    and the base is reached in the action performed by the body; while the steps
    that intervene by which one ought to descend in orderly fashion are "memory"
    of the past, "intelligence" of the present, "shrewdness" in considering the
    future outcome, "reasoning" which compares one thing with another,
    "docility" in accepting the opinions of others. He that takes counsel
    descends by these steps in due order, whereas if a man is rushed into action
    by the impulse of his will or of a passion, without taking these steps, it
    will be a case of precipitation. Since then inordinate counsel pertains to
    imprudence, it is evident that the vice of precipitation is contained under
    imprudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Rectitude of counsel belongs to the gift
    of counsel and to the virtue of prudence; albeit in different ways, as
    stated above (<a href="SS052.html#SSQ52OUTP1">Question [52]</a>,
    <a href="SS052.html#SSQ52A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), and consequently
    precipitation is opposed to both.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Things are said to be done rashly when
    they are not directed by reason: and this may happen in two ways; first
    through the impulse of the will or of a passion, secondly through contempt
    of the directing rule; and this is what is meant by rashness properly
    speaking, wherefore it appears to proceed from that root of pride, which
    refuses to submit to another's ruling. But precipitation refers to both, so
    that rashness is contained under precipitation, although precipitation
    refers rather to the first.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Many things have to be considered in the
    research of reason; hence the Philosopher declares (Ethic. vi, 9) that "one
    should be slow in taking counsel." Hence precipitation is more directly
    opposed to rectitude of counsel than over slowness is, for the latter bears
    a certain likeness to right counsel.<br />

    Whether thoughtlessness is a special sin included in prudence?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that thoughtlessness is not a
    special sin included in imprudence. For the Divine law does not incite us to
    any sin, according to Ps. 18:8, "The law of the Lord is unspotted"; and yet
    it incites us to be thoughtless, according to Mt. 10:19, "Take no thought
    how or what to speak." Therefore thoughtlessness is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever takes counsel must needs give
    thought to many things. Now precipitation is due to a defect of counsel and
    therefore to a defect of thought. Therefore precipitation is contained under
    thoughtlessness: and consequently thoughtlessness is not a special sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, prudence consists in acts of the
    practical reason, viz. "counsel," "judgment" about what has been counselled,
    and "command" [*Cf. Question [47], Article [8]]. Now thought precedes all
    these acts, since it belongs also to the speculative intellect. Therefore
    thoughtlessness is not a special sin contained under imprudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++4%3A25"
      >Prov. 4:25</a
    >): "Let thy eyes look straight on, and let thine eye-lids go before thy
    steps." Now this pertains to prudence, while the contrary pertains to
    thoughtlessness. Therefore thoughtlessness is a special sin contained under
    imprudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Thought signifies the act of the intellect in
    considering the truth about. something. Now just as research belongs to the
    reason, so judgment belongs to the intellect. Wherefore in speculative
    matters a demonstrative science is said to exercise judgment, in so far as
    it judges the truth of the results of research by tracing those results back
    to the first indemonstrable principles. Hence thought pertains chiefly to
    judgment; and consequently the lack of right judgment belongs to the vice of
    thoughtlessness, in so far, to wit, as one fails to judge rightly through
    contempt or neglect of those things on which a right judgment depends. It is
    therefore evident that thoughtlessness is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Our Lord did not forbid us to take
    thought, when we have the opportunity, about what we ought to do or say,
    but, in the words quoted, He encourages His disciples, so that when they had
    no opportunity of taking thought, either through lack of knowledge or
    through a sudden call, they should trust in the guidance of God alone,
    because "as we know not what to do, we can only turn our eyes to God,"
    according to 2 Paral 20:12: else if man, instead of doing what he can, were
    to be content with awaiting God's assistance, he would seem to tempt God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All thought about those things of which
    counsel takes cognizance, is directed to the formation of a right judgment,
    wherefore this thought is perfected in judgment. Consequently
    thoughtlessness is above all opposed to the rectitude of judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Thoughtlessness is to be taken here in
    relation to a determinate matter, namely, that of human action, wherein more
    things have to be thought about for the purpose of right judgment, than in
    speculative matters, because actions are about singulars.<br />

    Whether inconstancy is a vice contained under prudence?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that inconstancy is not a vice
    contained under imprudence. For inconstancy consists seemingly in a lack of
    perseverance in matters of difficulty. But perseverance in difficult matters
    belongs to fortitude. Therefore inconstancy is opposed to fortitude rather
    than to prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+3%3A16"
      >James 3:16</a
    >): "Where jealousy [Douay: 'envy'] and contention are, there are
    inconstancy and every evil work." But jealousy pertains to envy. Therefore
    inconstancy pertains not to imprudence but to envy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a man would seem to be inconstant who
    fails to persevere in what he has proposed to do. Now this is a mark of
    "incontinency" in pleasurable matters, and of "effeminacy" or
    "squeamishness" in unpleasant matters, according to Ethic. vii, 1. Therefore
    inconstancy does not pertain to imprudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It belongs to prudence to prefer the greater
    good to the lesser. Therefore to forsake the greater good belongs to
    imprudence. Now this is inconstancy. Therefore inconstancy belongs to
    imprudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Inconstancy denotes withdrawal from a definite
    good purpose. Now the origin of this withdrawal is in the appetite, for a
    man does not withdraw from a previous good purpose, except on account of
    something being inordinately pleasing to him: nor is this withdrawal
    completed except through a defect of reason, which is deceived in rejecting
    what before it had rightly accepted. And since it can resist the impulse of
    the passions, if it fail to do this, it is due to its own weakness in not
    standing to the good purpose it has conceived; hence inconstancy, as to its
    completion, is due to a defect in the reason. Now just as all rectitude of
    the practical reason belongs in some degree to prudence, so all lack of that
    rectitude belongs to imprudence. Consequently inconstancy, as to its
    completion, belongs to imprudence. And just as precipitation is due to a
    defect in the act of counsel, and thoughtlessness to a defect in the act of
    judgment, so inconstancy arises from a defect in the act of command. For a
    man is stated to be inconstant because his reason fails in commanding what
    has been counselled and judged.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The good of prudence is shared by all
    the moral virtues, and accordingly perseverance in good belongs to all moral
    virtues, chiefly, however, to fortitude, which suffers a greater impulse to
    the contrary.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Envy and anger, which are the source of
    contention, cause inconstancy on the part of the appetite, to which power
    the origin of inconstancy is due, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Continency and perseverance seem to be
    not in the appetitive power, but in the reason. For the continent man
    suffers evil concupiscences, and the persevering man suffers grievous
    sorrows (which points to a defect in the appetitive power); but reason
    stands firm, in the continent man, against concupiscence, and in the
    persevering man, against sorrow. Hence continency and perseverance seem to
    be species of constancy which pertains to reason; and to this power
    inconstancy pertains also.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the aforesaid vices arise from lust?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the aforesaid vices do not
    arise from lust. For inconstancy arises from envy, as stated above (<a
      href="SS053.html#SSQ53A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >, ad 2). But envy is a distinct vice from lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+1%3A8"
      >James 1:8</a
    >): "A double-minded man is inconstant in all his ways." Now duplicity does
    not seem to pertain to lust, but rather to deceitfulness, which is a
    daughter of covetousness, according to Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45). Therefore
    the aforesaid vices do not arise from lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the aforesaid vices are connected with
    some defect of reason. Now spiritual vices are more akin to the reason than
    carnal vices. Therefore the aforesaid vices arise from spiritual vices
    rather than from carnal vices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory declares (Moral. xxxi, 45) that the
    aforesaid vices arise from lust.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the Philosopher states (Ethic. vi, 5)
    "pleasure above all corrupts the estimate of prudence," and chiefly sexual
    pleasure which absorbs the mind, and draws it to sensible delight. Now the
    perfection of prudence and of every intellectual virtue consists in
    abstraction from sensible objects. Wherefore, since the aforesaid vices
    involve a defect of prudence and of the practical reason, as stated above
    (<a href="SS053.html#SSQ53ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,5), it follows that they
    arise chiefly from lust.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Envy and anger cause inconstancy by
    drawing away the reason to something else; whereas lust causes inconstancy
    by destroying the judgment of reason entirely. Hence the Philosopher says
    (Ethic. vii, 6) that "the man who is incontinent through anger listens to
    reason, yet not perfectly, whereas he who is incontinent through lust does
    not listen to it at all."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Duplicity also is something resulting
    from lust, just as inconstancy is, if by duplicity we understand fluctuation
    of the mind from one thing to another. Hence Terence says (Eunuch. act 1,
    sc. 1) that "love leads to war, and likewise to peace and truce."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Carnal vices destroy the judgment of
    reason so much the more as they lead us away from reason.<br />
