  <h3 align="left">Whether flattery is a sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that flattery is not a sin. For flattery
    consists in words of praise offered to another in order to please him. But
    it is not a sin to praise a person, according to Prov. 31:28, "Her children
    rose up and called her blessed: her husband, and he praised her." Moreover,
    there is no evil in wishing to please others, according to 1 Cor. 10:33,
    "I... in all things please all men." Therefore flattery is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, evil is contrary to good, and blame to
    praise. But it is not a sin to blame evil. Neither, then, is it a sin to
    praise good, which seems to belong to flattery. Therefore flattery is not a
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, detraction is contrary to flattery.
    Wherefore Gregory says (Moral. xxii, 5) that detraction is a remedy against
    flattery. "It must be observed," says he, "that by the wonderful moderation
    of our Ruler, we are often allowed to be rent by detractions but are
    uplifted by immoderate praise, so that whom the voice of the flatterer
    upraises, the tongue of the detractor may humble." But detraction is an
    evil, as stated above (<a href="SS073.html#SSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>,
    <a href="SS073.html#SSQ73ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3). Therefore flattery is
    a good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Ezech. 13:18, "Woe to them that
    sew cushions under every elbow," says, "that is to say, sweet flattery."
    Therefore flattery is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS114.html#SSQ114OUTP1"
      >Question [114]</a
    >, <a href="SS114.html#SSQ114A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3), although the
    friendship of which we have been speaking, or affability, intends chiefly
    the pleasure of those among whom one lives, yet it does not fear to
    displease when it is a question of obtaining a certain good, or of avoiding
    a certain evil. Accordingly, if a man were to wish always to speak
    pleasantly to others, he would exceed the mode of pleasing, and would
    therefore sin by excess. If he do this with the mere intention of pleasing
    he is said to be "complaisant," according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 6):
    whereas if he do it with the intention of making some gain out of it, he is
    called a "flatterer" or "adulator." As a rule, however, the term "flattery"
    is wont to be applied to all who wish to exceed the mode of virtue in
    pleasing others by words or deeds in their ordinary behavior towards their
    fellows.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> One may praise a person both well and
    ill, according as one observes or omits the due circumstances. For if while
    observing other due circumstances one were to wish to please a person by
    praising him, in order thereby to console him, or that he may strive to make
    progress in good, this will belong to the aforesaid virtue of friendship.
    But it would belong to flattery, if one wished to praise a person for things
    in which he ought not to be praised; since perhaps they are evil, according
    to Ps. 9:24, "The sinner is praised in the desires of his soul"; or they may
    be uncertain, according to Ecclus. 27:8, "Praise not a man before he
    speaketh," and again (Ecclus. 11:2), "Praise not a man for his beauty"; or
    because there may be fear lest human praise should incite him to vainglory,
    wherefore it is written, (Ecclus. 11:30), "Praise not any man before death."
    Again, in like manner it is right to wish to please a man in order to foster
    charity, so that he may make spiritual progress therein. But it would be
    sinful to wish to please men for the sake of vainglory or gain, or to please
    them in something evil, according to Ps. 52:6, "God hath scattered the bones
    of them that please men," and according to the words of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++1%3A10"
      >Gal. 1:10</a
    >), "If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even to blame evil is sinful, if due
    circumstances be not observed; and so too is it to praise good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Nothing hinders two vices being contrary
    to one another. Wherefore even as detraction is evil, so is flattery, which
    is contrary thereto as regards what is said, but not directly as regards the
    end. Because flattery seeks to please the person flattered, whereas the
    detractor seeks not the displeasure of the person defamed, since at times he
    defames him in secret, but seeks rather his defamation.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether flattery is a mortal sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that flattery is a mortal sin. For,
    according to Augustine (Enchiridion xii), "a thing is evil because it is
    harmful." But flattery is most harmful, according to Ps. 9:24, "For the
    sinner is praised in the desires of his soul, and the unjust man is blessed.
    The sinner hath provoked the Lord." Wherefore Jerome says (Ep. ad Celant):
    "Nothing so easily corrupts the human mind as flattery": and a gloss on Ps.
    69:4, "Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that say to me:
    'Tis well, 'Tis well," says: "The tongue of the flatterer harms more than
    the sword of the persecutor." Therefore flattery is a most grievous sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever does harm by words, harms
    himself no less than others: wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++36%3A15"
      >Ps. 36:15</a
    >): "Let their sword enter into their own hearts." Now he that flatters
    another induces him to sin mortally: hence a gloss on Ps. 140:5, "Let not
    the oil of the sinner fatten my head," says: "The false praise of the
    flatterer softens the mind by depriving it of the rigidity of truth and
    renders it susceptive of vice." Much more, therefore, does the flatterer sin
    in himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written in the Decretals (D. XLVI,
    Cap. 3): "The cleric who shall be found to spend his time in flattery and
    treachery shall be degraded from his office." Now such a punishment as this
    is not inflicted save for mortal sin. Therefore flattery is a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine in a sermon on Purgatory (xli, de
    Sanctis) reckons among slight sins, "if one desire to flatter any person of
    higher standing, whether of one's own choice, or out of necessity."
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS112.html#SSQ112OUTP1"
      >Question [112]</a
    >, <a href="SS112.html#SSQ112A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), a mortal sin is one
    that is contrary to charity. Now flattery is sometimes contrary to charity
    and sometimes not. It is contrary to charity in three ways. First, by reason
    of the very matter, as when one man praises another's sin: for this is
    contrary to the love of God, against Whose justice he speaks, and contrary
    to the love of his neighbor, whom he encourages to sin. Wherefore this is a
    mortal sin, according to Is. 5:20. "Woe to you that call evil good."
    Secondly, by reason of the intention, as when one man flatters another, so
    that by deceiving him he may injure him in body or in soul; this is also a
    mortal sin, and of this it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++27%3A6"
      >Prov. 27:6</a
    >): "Better are the wounds of a friend than the deceitful kisses of an
    enemy." Thirdly, by way of occasion, as when the praise of a flatterer, even
    without his intending it, becomes to another an occasion of sin. In this
    case it is necessary to consider, whether the occasion were given or taken,
    and how grievous the consequent downfall, as may be understood from what has
    been said above concerning scandal (<a href="SS043.html#SSQ43OUTP1"
      >Question [43]</a
    >, <a href="SS043.html#SSQ43ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4). If, however, one
    man flatters another from the mere craving to please others, or again in
    order to avoid some evil, or to acquire something in a case of necessity,
    this is not contrary to charity. Consequently it is not a mortal but a
    venial sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The passages quoted speak of the
    flatterer who praises another's sin. Flattery of this kind is said to harm
    more than the sword of the persecutor, since it does harm to goods that are
    of greater consequence. namely, spiritual goods. Yet it does not harm so
    efficaciously, since the sword of the persecutor slays effectively, being a
    sufficient cause of death; whereas no one by flattering can be a sufficient
    cause of another's sinning, as was shown above (<a
      href="SS043.html#SSQ43OUTP1"
      >Question [43]</a
    >, <a href="SS043.html#SSQ43A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,

    <a href="../FS/FS080.html#FSQ80A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument applies to one that
    flatters with the intention of doing harm: for such a man harms himself more
    than others, since he harms himself, as the sufficient cause of sinning,
    whereas he is only the occasional cause of the harm he does to others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The passage quoted refers to the man who
    flatters another treacherously, in order to deceive him.<br />
