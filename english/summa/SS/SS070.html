<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider injustice with regard to the person of the witness. 
Under this head there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS070.html#SSQ70A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a man is bound to give evidence?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS070.html#SSQ70A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the evidence of two or three witnesses suffices?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man is not bound to give evidence. Augustine 
say (Questions. Gn. 1:26) [*Cf. Contra Faust. xxii, 33,34], that when Abraham 
said of his wife (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++20%3A2">Gn. 20:2</a>), "She is my sister," he wished the truth to 
be concealed and not a lie be told. Now, by hiding the truth a man 
abstains from giving evidence. Therefore a man is not bound to give 
evidence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no man is bound to act deceitfully. Now it is written 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++11%3A13">Prov. 11:13</a>): "He that walketh deceitfully revealeth secrets, but he 
that is faithful concealeth the thing committed to him by his friend." 
Therefore a man is not always bound to give evidence, especially on 
matters committed to him as a secret by a friend.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, clerics and priests, more than others, are bound to 
those things that are necessary for salvation. Yet clerics and priests 
are forbidden to give evidence when a man is on trial for his life. 
Therefore it is not necessary for salvation to give evidence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine [*Can. Quisquis, caus. xi, qu. 3, cap. 
Falsidicus; cf. Isidore, Sentent. iii, 55] says: "Both he who conceals 
the truth and he who tells a lie are guilty, the former because he is 
unwilling to do good, the latter because he desires to hurt."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We must make a distinction in the matter of giving 
evidence: because sometimes a certain man's evidence is necessary, and 
sometimes not. If the necessary evidence is that of a man subject to a 
superior whom, in matters pertaining to justice, he is bound to obey, 
without doubt he is bound to give evidence on those points which are 
required of him in accordance with the order of justice, for instance on 
manifest things or when ill-report has preceded. If however he is 
required to give evidence on other points, for instance secret matters, 
and those of which no ill-report has preceded, he is not bound to give 
evidence. On the other hand, if his evidence be required by authority of 
a superior whom he is bound to obey, we must make a distinction: because 
if his evidence is required in order to deliver a man from an unjust 
death or any other penalty, or from false defamation, or some loss, in 
such cases he is bound to give evidence. Even if his evidence is not 
demanded, he is bound to do what he can to declare the truth to  someone 
who may profit thereby. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++81%3A4">Ps. 81:4</a>): "Rescue the poor, 
and deliver the needy from the hand of the sinner"; and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++24%3A11">Prov. 24:11</a>): 
"Deliver them that are led to death"; and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A32">Rm. 1:32</a>): "They are worthy of 
death, not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them 
that do them," on which words a gloss says: "To be silent when one can 
disprove is to consent." In matters pertaining to a man's condemnation, 
one is not bound to give evidence, except when one is constrained by a 
superior in accordance with the order of justice; since if the truth of 
such a matter be concealed, no particular injury is inflicted on anyone. 
Or, if some danger threatens the accuser, it matters not since he risked 
the danger of his own accord: whereas it is different with the accused, 
who incurs the danger against his will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine is speaking of concealment of the truth in a case 
when a man is not compelled by his superior's authority to declare the 
truth, and when such concealment is not specially injurious to any person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A man should by no means give evidence on matters secretly 
committed to him in confession, because he knows such things, not as man 
but as God's minister: and the sacrament is more binding than any human 
precept. But as regards matters committed to man in some other way under 
secrecy, we must make a distinction. Sometimes they are of such a nature 
that one is bound to make them known as soon as they come to our 
knowledge, for instance if they conduce to the spiritual or corporal 
corruption of the community, or to some grave personal injury, in short 
any like matter that a man is bound to make known either by giving 
evidence or by denouncing it. Against such a duty a man cannot be obliged 
to act on the plea that the matter is committed to him under secrecy, for 
he would break the faith he owes to another. On the other hand sometimes 
they are such as one is not bound to make known, so that one may be under 
obligation not to do so on account of their being committed to one under 
secrecy. In such a case one is by no means bound to make them known, even 
if the superior should command; because to keep faith is of natural 
right, and a man cannot be commanded to do what is contrary to natural 
right.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is unbecoming for ministers of the altar to slay a man 
or to cooperate in his slaying, as stated above (<A Href="SS064.html#SSQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>, <A Href="SS064.html#SSQ64A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>); hence 
according to the order of justice they cannot be compelled to give 
evidence when a man is on trial for his life.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the evidence of two or three persons suffices?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the evidence of two or three persons is not 
sufficient. For judgment requires certitude. Now certitude of the truth 
is not obtained by the assertions of two or three witnesses, for we read 
that Naboth was unjustly condemned on the evidence of two witnesses (3 
Kgs. 21). Therefore the evidence of two or three witnesses does not 
suffice. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in order for evidence to be credible it must agree. But 
frequently the evidence of two or three disagrees in some point. 
Therefore it is of no use for proving the truth in court.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is laid down (Decret. II, qu. iv, can. Praesul.): "A 
bishop shall not be condemned save on the evidence of seventy-two 
witnesses; nor a cardinal priest of the Roman Church, unless there be 
sixty-four witnesses. Nor a cardinal deacon of the Roman Church, unless 
there be twenty-seven witnesses; nor a subdeacon, an acolyte, an 
exorcist, a reader or a doorkeeper without seven witnesses." Now the sin 
of one who is of higher dignity is more grievous, and consequently should 
be treated more severely. Therefore neither is the evidence of two or 
three witnesses sufficient for the condemnation of other persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++17%3A6">Dt. 17:6</a>): "By the mouth of two or three 
witnesses shall he die that is to be slain," and further on (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++19%3A15">Dt. 19:15</a>): 
"In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall stand."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. i, 3), "we must not 
expect to find certitude equally in every matter." For in human acts, on 
which judgments are passed and evidence required, it is impossible to 
have demonstrative certitude, because they a about things contingent and 
variable. Hence the certitude of probability suffices, such as may reach 
the truth in the greater number, cases, although it fail in the minority. 
No it is probable that the assertion of sever witnesses contains the 
truth rather than the assertion of one: and since the accused is the only 
one who denies, while several witness affirm the same as the prosecutor, 
it is reasonably established both by Divine and by human law, that the 
assertion of several witnesses should be upheld. Now all multitude is 
comprised of three elements, the beginning, the middle and the end. 
Wherefore, according to the Philosopher (De Coelo i, 1), "we reckon 'all' 
and 'whole' to consist of three parts." Now we have a triple voucher when 
two agree with the prosecutor: hence two witnesses are required; or for 
the sake of greater certitude three, which is the perfect number. 
Wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eccles++4%3A12">Eccles. 4:12</a>): "A threefold cord is not easily 
broken": and Augustine, commenting on Jn. 8:17, "The testimony of two men 
is true," says (Tract. xxxvi) that "there is here a mystery by which we 
are given to understand that Trinity wherein is perpetual stability of 
truth."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> No matter how great a number of witnesses may be 
determined, the evidence might sometimes be unjust, since is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++23%3A2">Ex. 23:2</a>): "Thou shalt not follow the multitude to do evil." And yet the fact 
that in so many it is not possible to have certitude without fear of 
error, is no reason why we should reject the certitude which can probably 
be had through two or three witnesses, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If the witnesses disagree certain principal circumstances 
which change the substance of the fact, for instance in time, place, or 
persons, which are chiefly in question, their evidence is of no weight, 
because if they disagree in such things, each one would seem to be giving 
distinct evidence and to be speaking of different facts. For instance, 
one say that a certain thing happened at such and such a time or place, 
while another says it happened at another time or place, they seem not to 
be speaking of the same event. The evidence is not weakened if one 
witness says that he does not remember, while the other attests to a 
determinate time or place And if on such points as these the witness for 
prosecution and defense disagree altogether, and if they be equal in 
number on either side, and of equal standing, the accused should have the 
benefit of the doubt, because the judge ought to be more inclined to 
acquit than to condemn, except perhaps in favorable suits, such as a 
pleading for liberty and the like. If, however, the witnesses for the 
same side disagree, the judge ought to use his own discretion in 
discerning which side to favor, by considering either the number of 
witnesses, or their standing, or the favorableness of the suit, or the 
nature of the business and of the evidence<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Much more ought the evidence of one witness to be rejected if he 
contradict himself when questioned about what he has seen and about what 
he knows; not, however, if he contradict himself when questioned about 
matters of opinion and report, since he may be moved to answer 
differently according to the different things he has seen and heard.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand if there be discrepancy of evidence in circumstances 
not touching the substance of the fact, for instance, whether the weather 
were cloudy or fine, whether the house were painted or not, or such like 
matters, such discrepancy does not weaken the evidence, because men are 
not wont to take much notice of such things, wherefore they easily forget 
them. Indeed, a discrepancy of this kind renders the evidence more 
credible, as Chrysostom states (Hom. i in Matth.), because if the 
witnesses agreed in every point, even in the minutest of details, they 
would seem to have conspired together to say the same thing: but this 
must be left to the prudent discernment of the judge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This passage refers specially to the bishops, priests, 
deacons and clerics of the Roman Church, on account of its dignity: and 
this for three reasons. First because in that Church those men ought to 
be promoted whose sanctity makes their evidence of more weight than that 
of many witnesses. Secondly, because those who have to judge other men, 
often have many opponents on account of their justice, wherefore those 
who give evidence against them should not be believed indiscriminately, 
unless they be very numerous. Thirdly, because the condemnation of any 
one of them would detract in public opinion from the dignity and 
authority of that Church, a result which would be more fraught with 
danger than if one were to tolerate a sinner in that same Church, unless 
he were very notorious and manifest, so that a grave scandal would  arise 
if he were tolerated.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man's evidence can be rejected without any fault of his?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man's evidence ought not to be rejected 
except on account of some fault. For it a penalty on some that their 
evidence is inadmissible, as in the case of those who are branded with 
infamy. Now a penalty must not be inflicted save for a fault. Therefore 
it would seem that no man's evidence ought to be rejected save on account 
of a fault.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "Good is to be presumed of every one, unless the 
contrary appear" [*Cap. Dudum, de Praesumpt.]. Now it pertains to a man's 
goodness that he should give true evidence. Since therefore there can be 
no proof of the contrary, unless there be some fault of his, it would 
seem that no man's evidence should be rejected save for some fault.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no man is rendered unfit for things necessary for 
salvation except by some sin. But it is necessary for salvation to give 
true evidence, as stated above (<A Href="SS070.html#SSQ70A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore no man should be 
excluded from giving evidence save for some fault.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Regist. xiii, 44): "As to the bishop who 
is said to have been accused by his servants, you are to know that they 
should by no means have been heard": which words are embodied in the 
Decretals II, qu. 1, can. Imprimis.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS070.html#SSQ70A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the authority of evidence is not 
infallible but probable; and consequently the evidence for one side is 
weakened by whatever strengthens the probability of the other. Now the 
reliability of a person's evidence is weakened, sometimes indeed on 
account of some fault of his, as in the case of unbelievers and persons 
of evil repute, as well as those who are guilty of a public crime and who 
are not allowed even to accuse; sometimes, without any fault on his part, 
and this owing either to a defect in the reason, as in the case of 
children, imbeciles and women, or to personal feeling, as in the case of 
enemies, or persons united by family or household ties, or again owing to 
some external condition, as in the case of poor people, slaves, and those 
who are under authority, concerning whom it is to be presumed that they 
might easily be induced to give evidence against the truth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it is manifest that a person's evidence may be rejected either with 
or without some fault of his.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> If a person is disqualified from giving evidence this is 
done as a precaution against false evidence rather than as a punishment. 
Hence the argument does not prove.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Good is to be presumed of everyone unless the contrary 
appear, provided this does not threaten injury to another:  because, in 
that case, one ought to be careful not to believe everyone readily, 
according to 1 Jn. 4:1: "Believe not every spirit."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To give evidence is necessary for salvation, provided the 
witness be competent, and the order of justice observed. Hence nothing 
hinders certain persons being excused from giving evidence, if they be 
considered unfit according to law.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not always a mortal sin to give false 
evidence. For a person may happen to give false evidence, through 
ignorance of fact. Now such ignorance excuses from mortal sin. Therefore 
the giving of false evidence is not always a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a lie that benefits someone and hurts no man is 
officious, and this is not a mortal sin. Now sometimes a lie of this kind 
occurs in false evidence, as when a person gives false evidence in order 
to save a man from death, or from an unjust sentence which threatens him 
through other false witnesses or a perverse judge. Therefore in such 
cases it is not a mortal sin to give false evidence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a witness is required to take an oath in order that he 
may fear to commit a mortal sin of perjury. But this would not be 
necessary, if it were already a mortal sin to give false evidence. 
Therefore the giving of false evidence is not always mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++19%3A5">Prov. 19:5</a>): "A false witness shall not 
be unpunished."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> False evidence has a threefold deformity. The first is 
owing to perjury, since witnesses are admitted only on oath and on this 
count it is always a mortal sin. Secondly, owing to the violation of 
justice, and on this account it is a mortal sin generically, even as any 
kind of injustice. Hence the prohibition of false evidence by the precept 
of the decalogue is expressed in this form when it is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++20%3A16">Ex. 20:16</a>), 
"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor." For one does 
nothing against a man by preventing him from doing someone an injury, but 
only by taking away his justice. Thirdly, owing to the falsehood itself, 
by reason of which every lie is a sin: on this account, the giving of 
false evidence is not always a mortal sin.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In giving evidence a man ought not to affirm as certain, as 
though he knew it, that about which he is not certain and he should 
confess his doubt in doubtful terms, and that which he is certain about, 
in terms of certainty. Owing however to the frailty of the human memory, 
a man sometimes thinks he is certain about something that is not true; 
and then if after thinking over  the matter with due care he deems 
himself certain about that false thing, he does not sin mortally if he 
asserts it, because the evidence which he gives is not directly an 
intentionally, but accidentally contrary to what he intends.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An unjust judgment is not a judgment, wherefore the false 
evidence given in an unjust judgment, in order to prevent injustice is 
not a mortal sin by virtue of the judgment, but only by reason of the 
oath violated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[70] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Men abhor chiefly those sin that are against God, as being 
most grievous and among them is perjury: whereas they do not abhor so 
much sins against their neighbor. Consequently, for the greater certitude 
of evidence, the witness is required to take a oath.<br>
