    Whether tale-bearing is a sin distinct from backbiting?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that tale-bearing is not a distinct
    sin from backbiting. Isidore says (Etym. x): "The susurro [tale-bearer]
    takes his name from the sound of his speech, for he speaks disparagingly not
    to the face but into the ear." But to speak of another disparagingly belongs
    to backbiting. Therefore tale-bearing is not a distinct sin from
    backbiting.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (Lev. 19:16): "Thou shalt
    not be an informer [Douay: 'a detractor'] nor a tale-bearer [Douay:
    'whisperer'] among the people." But an informer is apparently the same as a
    backbiter. Therefore neither does tale-bearing differ from backbiting.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (Ecclus. 28:15): "The
    tale-bearer [Douay: 'whisperer'] and the double-tongued is accursed." But a
    double-tongued man is apparently the same as a backbiter, because a
    backbiter speaks with a double tongue, with one in your absence, with
    another in your presence. Therefore a tale-bearer is the same as a
    backbiter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Rm. 1:29,30, "Tale-bearers,
    backbiters [Douay: 'whisperers, detractors']" says: "Tale-bearers sow
    discord among friends; backbiters deny or disparage others' good points."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The tale-bearer and the backbiter agree in
    matter, and also in form or mode of speaking, since they both speak evil
    secretly of their neighbor: and for this reason these terms are sometimes
    used one for the other. Hence a gloss on Ecclus. 5:16, "Be not called a
    tale-bearer [Douay: 'whisperer']" says: "i.e. a backbiter." They differ
    however in end, because the backbiter intends to blacken his neighbor's good
    name, wherefore he brings forward those evils especially about his neighbor
    which are likely to defame him, or at least to depreciate his good name:
    whereas a tale-bearer intends to sever friendship, as appears from the gloss
    quoted above and from the saying of Prov. 26:20, "Where the tale-bearer is
    taken away, contentions shall cease." Hence it is that a tale-bearer speaks
    such ill about his neighbors as may stir his hearer's mind against them,
    according to Ecclus. 28:11, "A sinful man will trouble his friends, and
    bring in debate in the midst of them that are at peace."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A tale-bearer is called a backbiter in
    so far as he speaks ill of another; yet he differs from a backbiter since he
    intends not to speak ill as such, but to say anything that may stir one man
    against another, though it be good simply, and yet has a semblance of evil
    through being unpleasant to the hearer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An informer differs from a tale-bearer
    and a backbiter, for an informer is one who charges others publicly with
    crimes, either by accusing or by railing them, which does not apply to a
    backbiter or tale-bearer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A double-tongued person is properly
    speaking a tale-bearer. For since friendship is between two, the tale-bearer
    strives to sever friendship on both sides. Hence he employs a double tongue
    towards two persons, by speaking ill of one to the other: wherefore it is
    written (Ecclus. 28:15): "The tale-bearer [Douay: 'whisperer'] and the
    double-tongued is accursed," and then it is added, "for he hath troubled
    many that were peace."<br />

    Whether backbiting is a graver sin than tale-bearing?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that backbiting is a graver sin
    than tale-bearing. For sins of word consist in speaking evil. Now a
    backbiter speaks of his neighbor things that are evil simply, for such
    things lead to the loss or depreciation of his good name: whereas a
    tale-bearer is only intent on saying what is apparently evil, because to wit
    they are unpleasant to the hearer. Therefore backbiting is a graver sin than
    tale-bearing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he that deprives. a man of his good
    name, deprives him not merely of one friend, but of many, because everyone
    is minded to scorn the friendship of a person with a bad name. Hence it is
    reproached against a certain individual [*King Josaphat] (2 Paralip 19:2):
    "Thou art joined in friendship with them that hate the Lord." But
    tale-bearing deprives one of only one friend. Therefore backbiting is a
    graver sin than tale-bearing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+4%3A11"
      >James 4:11</a
    >): "He that backbiteth [Douay:,'detracteth'] his brother... detracteth the
    law," and consequently God the giver of the law. Wherefore the sin of
    backbiting seems to be a sin against God, which is most grievous, as stated
    above (<a href="SS020.html#SSQ20OUTP1">Question [20]</a>,
    <a href="SS020.html#SSQ20A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). On the other hand
    the sin of tale-bearing is against one's neighbor. Therefore the sin of
    backbiting is graver than the sin of tale-bearing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 5:17): "An evil mark
    of disgrace is upon the double-tongued; but to the tale-bearer [Douay:
    'whisperer'] hatred, and enmity, and reproach."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS073.html#SSQ73OUTP1"
      >Question [73]</a
    >, <a href="SS073.html#SSQ73A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>), sins against one's
    neighbor are the more grievous, according as they inflict a greater injury
    on him: and an injury is so much the greater, according to the greatness of
    the good which it takes away. Now of all one's external goods a friend takes
    the first place, since "no man can live without friends," as the Philosopher
    declares (Ethic. viii, 1). Hence it is written (Ecclus. 6:15): "Nothing can
    be compared to a faithful friend." Again, a man's good name whereof
    backbiting deprives him, is most necessary to him that he may be fitted for
    friendship. Therefore tale-bearing is a greater sin than backbiting or even
    reviling, because a friend is better than honor, and to be loved is better
    than to be honored, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. viii).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The species and gravity of a sin depend
    on the end rather than on the material object, wherefore, by reason of its
    end, tale-bearing is worse than backbiting, although sometimes the backbiter
    says worse things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A good name is a disposition for
    friendship, and a bad name is a disposition for enmity. But a disposition
    falls short of the thing for which it disposes. Hence to do anything that
    leads to a disposition for enmity is a less grievous sin than to do what
    conduces directly to enmity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He that backbites his brother, seems to
    detract the law, in so far as he despises the precept of love for one's
    neighbor: while he that strives to sever friendship seems to act more
    directly against this precept. Hence the latter sin is more specially
    against God, because "God is charity" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++4%3A16"
      >1 Jn. 4:16</a
    >), and for this reason it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++6%3A16"
      >Prov. 6:16</a
    >): "Six things there are, which the Lord hateth, and the seventh His soul
    detesteth," and the seventh is "he (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++6%3A19"
      >Prov. 6:19</a
    >) that soweth discord among brethren."<br />
