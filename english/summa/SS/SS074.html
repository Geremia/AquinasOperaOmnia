<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider tale-bearing: under which head there are two points 
of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS074.html#SSQ74A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether tale-bearing is a sin distinct from backbiting?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS074.html#SSQ74A2THEP1">(2)</a> Which of the two is the more grievous?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that tale-bearing is not a distinct sin from 
backbiting. Isidore says (Etym. x): "The susurro [tale-bearer] takes his 
name from the sound of his speech, for he speaks disparagingly not to the 
face but into the ear." But to speak of another disparagingly belongs to 
backbiting. Therefore tale-bearing is not a distinct sin from backbiting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (Lev. 19:16): "Thou shalt not be an 
informer [Douay: 'a detractor'] nor a tale-bearer [Douay: 'whisperer'] 
among the people." But an informer is apparently the same as a backbiter. 
Therefore neither does tale-bearing differ from backbiting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (Ecclus. 28:15): "The tale-bearer [Douay: 
'whisperer'] and the double-tongued is accursed." But a double-tongued 
man is apparently the same as a backbiter, because a backbiter speaks 
with a double tongue, with one in your absence, with another in your 
presence. Therefore a tale-bearer is the same as a backbiter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Rm. 1:29,30, "Tale-bearers, backbiters 
[Douay: 'whisperers, detractors']" says: "Tale-bearers sow discord among 
friends; backbiters deny or disparage others' good points."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The tale-bearer and the backbiter agree in matter, and 
also in form or mode of speaking, since they both speak evil secretly of 
their neighbor: and for this reason these terms are sometimes used one 
for the other. Hence a gloss on Ecclus. 5:16, "Be not called a 
tale-bearer [Douay: 'whisperer']" says: "i.e. a backbiter." They differ 
however in end, because the backbiter intends to blacken his neighbor's 
good name, wherefore he brings forward those evils especially about his 
neighbor which are likely to defame him, or at least to depreciate his 
good name: whereas a tale-bearer intends to sever friendship, as appears 
from the gloss quoted above and from the saying of Prov. 26:20, "Where 
the tale-bearer is taken away, contentions shall cease." Hence it is that 
a tale-bearer speaks such ill about his neighbors as may stir his 
hearer's mind against them, according to Ecclus. 28:11, "A sinful man 
will trouble his friends, and bring in debate in the  midst of them that 
are at peace."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A tale-bearer is called a backbiter in so far as he speaks 
ill of another; yet he differs from a backbiter since he intends not to 
speak ill as such, but to say anything that may stir one man against 
another, though it be good simply, and yet has a semblance of evil 
through being unpleasant to the hearer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An informer differs from a tale-bearer and a backbiter, for 
an informer is one who charges others publicly with crimes, either by 
accusing or by railing them, which does not apply to a backbiter or 
tale-bearer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A double-tongued person is properly speaking a tale-bearer. 
For since friendship is between two, the tale-bearer strives to sever 
friendship on both sides. Hence he employs a double tongue towards two 
persons, by speaking ill of one to the other: wherefore it is written 
(Ecclus. 28:15): "The tale-bearer [Douay: 'whisperer'] and the 
double-tongued is accursed," and then it is added, "for he hath troubled 
many that were peace."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether backbiting is a graver sin than tale-bearing?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that backbiting is a graver sin than tale-bearing. 
For sins of word consist in speaking evil. Now a backbiter speaks of his 
neighbor things that are evil simply, for such things lead to the loss or 
depreciation of his good name: whereas a tale-bearer is only intent on 
saying what is apparently evil, because to wit they are unpleasant to the 
hearer. Therefore backbiting is a graver sin than tale-bearing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he that deprives. a man of his good name, deprives him 
not merely of one friend, but of many, because everyone is minded to 
scorn the friendship of a person with a bad name. Hence it is reproached 
against a certain individual [*King Josaphat] (2 Paralip 19:2): "Thou art 
joined in friendship with them that hate the Lord." But tale-bearing 
deprives one of only one friend. Therefore backbiting is a graver sin 
than tale-bearing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+4%3A11">James 4:11</a>): "He that backbiteth 
[Douay:,'detracteth'] his brother . . . detracteth the law," and 
consequently God the giver of the law. Wherefore the sin of backbiting 
seems to be a sin against God, which is most grievous, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS020.html#SSQ20OUTP1">Question [20]</a>, <A Href="SS020.html#SSQ20A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). On the other hand the sin of tale-bearing 
is against one's neighbor. Therefore the sin of backbiting is graver than 
the sin of tale-bearing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 5:17): "An evil mark of disgrace 
is upon the double-tongued; but to the tale-bearer [Douay: 'whisperer'] 
hatred, and enmity, and reproach."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS073.html#SSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="SS073.html#SSQ73A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>), sins 
against one's neighbor are the more grievous, according as they  inflict 
a greater injury on him: and an injury is so much the greater, according 
to the greatness of the good which it takes away. Now of all one's 
external goods a friend takes the first place, since "no man can live 
without friends," as the Philosopher declares (Ethic. viii, 1). Hence it 
is written (Ecclus. 6:15): "Nothing can be compared to a faithful 
friend." Again, a man's good name whereof backbiting deprives him, is 
most necessary to him that he may be fitted for friendship. Therefore 
tale-bearing is a greater sin than backbiting or even reviling, because a 
friend is better than honor, and to be loved is better than to be 
honored, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. viii).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The species and gravity of a sin depend on the end rather 
than on the material object, wherefore, by reason of its end, 
tale-bearing is worse than backbiting, although sometimes the backbiter 
says worse things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A good name is a disposition for friendship, and a bad name 
is a disposition for enmity. But a disposition falls short of the thing 
for which it disposes. Hence to do anything that leads to a disposition 
for enmity is a less grievous sin than to do what conduces directly to 
enmity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[74] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He that backbites his brother, seems to detract the law, in 
so far as he despises the precept of love for one's neighbor: while he 
that strives to sever friendship seems to act more directly against this 
precept. Hence the latter sin is more specially against God, because "God 
is charity" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++4%3A16">1 Jn. 4:16</a>), and for this reason it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++6%3A16">Prov. 6:16</a>): 
"Six things there are, which the Lord hateth, and the seventh His soul 
detesteth," and the seventh is "he (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++6%3A19">Prov. 6:19</a>) that soweth discord among 
brethren."<br>
