<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After religion we must consider piety, the consideration of which will 
render the opposite vices manifest. Accordingly four points of inquiry 
arise with regard to piety:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS101.html#SSQ101A1THEP1">(1)</a> To whom does piety extend?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS101.html#SSQ101A2THEP1">(2)</a> What does piety make one offer a person?

<H3 Align="Left">Whether piety extends to particular human individuals?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that piety does not extend to particular human 
individuals. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x) that piety denotes, 
properly speaking, the worship of God, which the Greeks designate by the 
term {eusebeia}. But the worship of God does not denote relation to man, 
but only to God. Therefore piety does not extend definitely to certain 
human individuals.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. i): "Piety, on her day, provides a 
banquet, because she fills the inmost recesses of the heart with works of 
mercy." Now the works of mercy are to be done to all, according to 
Augustine (De Doctr. Christ. i). Therefore piety does not extend 
definitely to certain special persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in human affairs there are many other mutual relations 
besides those of kindred and citizenship, as the Philosopher states 
(Ethic. viii, 11,12), and on each of them is founded a kind of 
friendship, which would seem to be the virtue of piety, according to a 
gloss on 2 Tim. 3:5, "Having an appearance indeed of piety [Douay: 
'godliness']." Therefore piety extends not only to one's kindred and 
fellow-citizens.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "it is by piety 
that we do our duty towards our kindred and well-wishers of our country 
and render them faithful service."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Man becomes a debtor to other men in various ways, 
according to their various excellence and the various benefits received 
from them. on both counts God holds first place, for He is supremely 
excellent, and is for us the first principle of being and government. In 
the second place, the principles of our being and government are our 
parents and our country, that have given us birth and nourishment. 
Consequently man is debtor chiefly to his parents and his country, after 
God. Wherefore just as it belongs to religion to give worship to God, so 
does it belong to piety, in the second place, to give worship to one's 
parents and one's country.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The worship due to our parents includes the worship given to all our 
kindred, since our kinsfolk are those who descend from the same parents, 
according to the Philosopher (Ethic. viii, 12). The worship given to our 
country includes homage to all our fellow-citizens and to all the friends 
of our country. Therefore piety extends chiefly to these.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The greater includes the lesser: wherefore the worship due 
to God includes the worship due to our parents as a particular. Hence it 
is written (Malach. 1:6): "If I be a father, where is My honor?" 
Consequently the term piety extends also to the divine worship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x), "the term piety is often 
used in connection with works of mercy, in the language of the common 
people; the reason for which I consider to be the fact that God Himself 
has declared that these works are more pleasing to Him than sacrifices. 
This custom has led to the application of the word 'pious' to God 
Himself."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The relations of a man with his kindred and fellow-citizens 
are more referable to the principles of his being than other relations: 
wherefore the term piety is more applicable to them.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether piety provides support for our parents?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that piety does not provide support for our parents. 
For, seemingly, the precept of the decalogue, "Honor thy  father and 
mother," belongs to piety. But this prescribes only the giving of honor. 
Therefore it does not belong to piety to provide support for one's 
parents.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man is bound to lay up for those whom he is bound to 
support. Now according to the Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++12%3A14">2 Cor. 12:14</a>), "neither ought the 
children to lay up for the parents." Therefore piety does not oblige them 
to support their parents.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, piety extends not only to one's parents, but also to 
other kinsmen and to one's fellow-citizens, as stated above (<A Href="SS101.html#SSQ101A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But 
one is not bound to support all one's kindred and fellow-citizens. 
Therefore neither is one bound to support one's parents.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++15%3A3-6">Mt. 15:3-6</a>) reproved the Pharisees for 
hindering children from supporting their parents.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We owe something to our parents in two ways: that is to 
say, both essentially, and accidentally. We owe them essentially that 
which is due to a father as such: and since he is his son's superior 
through being the principle of his being, the latter owes him reverence 
and service. Accidentally, that is due to a father, which it befits him 
to receive in respect of something accidental to him, for instance, if he 
be ill, it is fitting that his children should visit him and see to his 
cure; if he be poor, it is fitting that they should support him; and so 
on in like instance, all of which come under the head of service due. 
Hence Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that "piety gives both duty and 
homage": "duty" referring to service, and "homage" to reverence or honor, 
because, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x), "we are said to give homage 
to those whose memory or presence we honor."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to our Lord's interpretation (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++15%3A3-6">Mt. 15:3-6</a>) the 
honor due to our parents includes whatever support we owe them; and the 
reason for this is that support is given to one's father because it is 
due to him as to one greater.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since a father stands in the relation of principle, and his 
son in the relation of that which is from a principle, it is essentially 
fitting for a father to support his son: and consequently he is bound to 
support him not only for a time, but for all his life, and this is to lay 
by. On the other hand, for the son to bestow something on his father is 
accidental, arising from some momentary necessity, wherein he is bound to 
support him, but not to lay by as for a long time beforehand, because 
naturally parents are not the successors of their children, but children 
of their parents.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii), "we offer homage and 
duty to all our kindred and to the well-wishers of our country"; not, 
however, equally to all, but chiefly to our parents, and to others 
according to our means and their personal claims.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether piety is a special virtue distinct from other virtues?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that piety is not a special virtue distinct from other 
virtues. For the giving of service and homage to anyone proceeds from 
love. But it belongs to piety. Therefore piety is not a distinct virtue 
from charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is proper to religion to give worship to God. But 
piety also gives worship to God, according to Augustine (De Civ. Dei x). 
Therefore piety is not distinct from religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, piety, whereby we give our country worship and duty, 
seems to be the same as legal justice, which looks to the common good. 
But legal justice is a general virtue, according to the Philosopher 
(Ethic. v, 1,2). Therefore piety is not a special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is accounted by Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) as a 
part of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A special virtue is one that regards an object under a 
special aspect. Since, then, the nature of justice consists in rendering 
another person his due, wherever there is a special aspect of something 
due to a person, there is a special virtue. Now a thing is indebted in a 
special way to that which is its connatural principle of being and 
government. And piety regards this principle, inasmuch as it pays duty 
and homage to our parents and country, and to those who are related 
thereto. Therefore piety is a special virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as religion is a protestation of faith, hope and 
charity, whereby man is primarily directed to God, so again piety is a 
protestation of the charity we bear towards our parents and country.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God is the principle of our being and government in a far 
more excellent manner than one's father or country. Hence religion, which 
gives worship to God, is a distinct virtue from piety, which pays homage 
to our parents and country. But things relating to creatures are 
transferred to God as the summit of excellence and causality, as 
Dionysius says (Div. Nom. i): wherefore, by way of excellence, piety 
designates the worship of God, even as God, by way of excellence, is 
called "Our Father."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Piety extends to our country in so far as the latter is for 
us a principle of being: but legal justice regards the good of our 
country, considered as the common good: wherefore legal justice has more 
of the character of a general virtue than piety has.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the duties of piety towards one's parents should be omitted for the sake of religion? <br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the duties of piety towards one's parents should be 
omitted for the sake of religion. For Our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++14%3A26">Lk. 14:26</a>): "If any 
man come to Me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and 
children, and brethren, and sisters, yea and his own life also, he cannot 
be My disciple." Hence it is said in praise of James and John (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++4%3A22">Mt. 4:22</a>) 
that they left "their nets and father, and followed" Christ. Again it is 
said in praise of the Levites (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++33%3A9">Dt. 33:9</a>): "Who hath said to his father, 
and to his mother: I do not know you; and to his brethren: I know you 
not; and their own children they have not known. These have kept Thy 
word." Now a man who knows not his parents and other kinsmen, or who even 
hates them, must needs omit the duties of piety. Therefore the duties of 
piety should be omitted for the sake of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++9%3A59,60">Lk. 9:59,60</a>) that in answer to him who 
said: "Suffer me first to go and bury my father," Our Lord replied: "Let 
the dead bury their dead: but go thou, and preach the kingdom of God." 
Now the latter pertains to religion, while it is a duty of piety to bury 
one's father. Therefore a duty of piety should be omitted for the sake of 
religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God is called "Our Father" by excellence. Now just as we 
worship our parents by paying them the duties of piety so do we worship 
God by religion. Therefore the duties of piety should be omitted for the 
sake of the worship of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, religious are bound by a vow which they may not break to 
fulfil the observances of religion. Now in accordance with those 
observances they are hindered from supporting their parents, both on the 
score of poverty, since they have nothing of their own, and on the score 
of obedience, since they may not leave the cloister without the 
permission of their superior. Therefore the duties of piety towards one's 
parents should be omitted for the sake of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord reproved the Pharisees (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++15%3A3-6">Mt. 15:3-6</a>) who taught 
that for the sake of religion one ought to refrain from paying one's 
parents the honor we owe them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Religion and piety are two virtues. Now no virtue is 
opposed to another virtue, since according to the Philosopher, in his 
book on the Categories (Cap. De oppos.), "good is not opposed to good." 
Therefore it is impossible that religion and piety mutually hinder one 
another, so that the act of one be excluded by the act of the other. Now, 
as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS007.html#FSQ7OUTP1">Question [7]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS007.html#FSQ7A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), the act of every 
virtue is limited by the circumstances due thereto, and if it overstep 
them it will be an act no longer of virtue but of vice. Hence it belongs 
to piety to pay duty and homage to one's parents according to the due 
mode. But it is not the due mode that man should tend to worship his 
father rather than God, but, as Ambrose says on Lk. 12:52, "the piety of 
divine religion takes precedence of the claims of kindred."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[4] Body Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, if the worship of one's parents take one away from the 
worship of God it would no longer be an act of piety to pay worship to 
one's parents to the prejudice of God. Hence Jerome says (Ep. ad 
Heliod.): "Though thou trample upon thy father, though thou spurn thy 
mother, turn not aside, but with dry eyes hasten to the standard of the 
cross; it is the highest degree of piety to be cruel in this matter." 
Therefore in such a case the duties of piety towards one's parents should 
be omitted for the sake of the worship religion gives to God. If, 
however, by paying the services due to our parents, we are not withdrawn 
from the service of God, then will it be an act of piety, and there will 
be no need to set piety aside for the sake of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gregory expounding this saying of our Lord says (Hom. 
xxxvii in Ev.) that "when we find our parents to be a hindrance in our 
way to God, we must ignore them by hating and fleeing from them." For if 
our parents incite us to sin, and withdraw us from the service of God, we 
must, as regards this point, abandon and hate them. It is in this sense 
that the Levites are said to have not known their kindred, because they 
obeyed the Lord's command, and spared not the idolaters (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++32">Ex. 32</a>). James 
and John are praised for leaving their parents and following our Lord, 
not that their father incited them to evil, but because they deemed it 
possible for him to find another means of livelihood, if they followed 
Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Our Lord forbade the disciple to bury his father because, 
according to Chrysostom (Hom. xxviii in Matth.), "Our Lord by so doing 
saved him from many evils, such as the sorrows and worries and other 
things that one anticipates under these circumstances. For after the 
burial the will had to be read, the estate had to be divided, and so 
forth: but chiefly, because there were others who could see to the 
funeral." Or, according to Cyril's commentary on Lk. 9, "this disciple's 
request was, not that he might bury a dead father, but that he might 
support a yet living father in the latter's old age, until at length he 
should bury him. This is what Our Lord did not grant, because there were 
others, bound by the duties of kindred, to take care of him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[101] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Whatever we give our parents out of piety is referred by us 
to God; just as other works of mercy which we perform with regard to any 
of our neighbors are offered to God, according to Mt. 25:40: "As long as 
you did it to one of . . . My least . . . you did it to Me." Accordingly, 
if our carnal parents stand in need of our assistance, so that they have 
no other means of support, provided they incite us to nothing against 
God, we must not abandon them for the sake of religion. But if we cannot 
devote ourselves to their service without sin, or if they can be 
supported without our assistance, it is lawful to forego their service, 
so as to give more time to religion.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> We must speak differently of one who is yet in the world, 
and of one who has made his profession in religion. For he that is in the 
world, if he has parents unable to find support  without him, he must not 
leave them and enter religion, because he would be breaking the 
commandment prescribing the honoring of parents. Some say, however, that 
even then he might abandon them, and leave them in God's care. But this, 
considered aright, would be to tempt God: since, while having human means 
at hand, he would be exposing his parents to danger, in the hope of God's 
assistance. on the other hand, if the parents can find means of 
livelihood without him, it is lawful for him to abandon them and enter 
religion, because children are not bound to support their parents except 
in cases of necessity, as stated above. He that has already made his 
profession in religion is deemed to be already dead to the world: 
wherefore he ought not, under pretext of supporting his parents, to leave 
the cloister where he is buried with Christ, and busy himself once more 
with worldly affairs. Nevertheless he is bound, saving his obedience to 
his superiors, and his religious state withal, to make points efforts for 
his parents' support.<br>
