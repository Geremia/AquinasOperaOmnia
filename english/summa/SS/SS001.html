    <br />
    TREATISE ON THE THEOLOGICAL VIRTUES (Questions [1]-46)<br />
    <br />
    ON FAITH (Questions [1]-16)<br />
    <br />
    OF FAITH (TEN ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    Having to treat now of the theological virtues, we shall begin with Faith,
    secondly we shall speak of Hope, and thirdly, of Charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The treatise on Faith will be fourfold: (1) Of faith itself; (2) Of the
    corresponding gifts, knowledge and understanding; (3) Of the opposite vices;
    (4) Of the precepts pertaining to this virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    About faith itself we shall consider: (1) its object; (2) its act; (3) the
    habit of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are ten points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the object of faith is the
    First Truth?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the object of faith is
    something complex or incomplex, i.e. whether it is a thing or a
    proposition?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether anything false can come
    under faith?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the object of faith can be
    anything seen?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether it can be anything known?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether the things to be believed
    should be divided into a certain number of articles?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether the same articles are of
    faith for all times?
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A8THEP1">(8)</a> Of the number of articles;</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A9THEP1">(9)</a> Of the manner of embodying the
    articles in a symbol;
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A10THEP1">(10)</a> Who has the right to propose a
    symbol of faith?

  <h3 align="left">Whether the object of faith is the First Truth?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the object of faith is not the
    First Truth. For it seems that the object of faith is that which is proposed
    to us to be believed. Now not only things pertaining to the Godhead, i.e.
    the First Truth, are proposed to us to be believed, but also things
    concerning Christ's human nature, and the sacraments of the Church, and the
    condition of creatures. Therefore the object of faith is not only the First
    Truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, faith and unbelief have the same object
    since they are opposed to one another. Now unbelief can be about all things
    contained in Holy Writ, for whichever one of them a man denies, he is
    considered an unbeliever. Therefore faith also is about all things contained
    in Holy Writ. But there are many things therein, concerning man and other
    creatures. Therefore the object of faith is not only the First Truth, but
    also created truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, faith is condivided with charity, as
    stated above (FS, Question [62], Article [3]). Now by charity we love not
    only God, who is the sovereign Good, but also our neighbor. Therefore the
    object of Faith is not only the First Truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that "faith is
    about the simple and everlasting truth." Now this is the First Truth.
    Therefore the object of faith is the First Truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The object of every cognitive habit includes
    two things: first, that which is known materially, and is the material
    object, so to speak, and, secondly, that whereby it is known, which is the
    formal aspect of the object. Thus in the science of geometry, the
    conclusions are what is known materially, while the formal aspect of the
    science is the mean of demonstration, through which the conclusions are
    known.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly if we consider, in faith, the formal aspect of the object, it is
    nothing else than the First Truth. For the faith of which we are speaking,
    does not assent to anything, except because it is revealed by God. Hence the
    mean on which faith is based is the Divine Truth. If, however, we consider
    materially the things to which faith assents, they include not only God, but
    also many other things, which, nevertheless, do not come under the assent of
    faith, except as bearing some relation to God, in as much as, to wit,
    through certain effects of the Divine operation, man is helped on his
    journey towards the enjoyment of God. Consequently from this point of view
    also the object of faith is, in a way, the First Truth, in as much as
    nothing comes under faith except in relation to God, even as the object of
    the medical art is health, for it considers nothing save in relation to
    health.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Things concerning Christ's human nature,
    and the sacraments of the Church, or any creatures whatever, come under
    faith, in so far as by them we are directed to God, and in as much as we
    assent to them on account of the Divine Truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The same answer applies to the Second Objection, as regards all things
    contained in Holy Writ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Charity also loves our neighbor on
    account of God, so that its object, properly speaking, is God, as we shall
    show further on (<a href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>,
    <a href="SS025.html#SSQ25A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the object of faith is something complex, by way of a
    proposition?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the object of faith is not
    something complex by way of a proposition. For the object of faith is the
    First Truth, as stated above (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Now the First Truth is something simple. Therefore the object of faith
    is not something complex.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the exposition of faith is contained in
    the symbol. Now the symbol does not contain propositions, but things: for it
    is not stated therein that God is almighty, but: "I believe in God...
    almighty." Therefore the object of faith is not a proposition but a
    thing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, faith is succeeded by vision, according
    to 1 Cor. 13:12: "We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face
    to face. Now I know in part; but then I shall know even as I am known." But
    the object of the heavenly vision is something simple, for it is the Divine
    Essence. Therefore the faith of the wayfarer is also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Faith is a mean between science and opinion.
    Now the mean is in the same genus as the extremes. Since, then, science and
    opinion are about propositions, it seems that faith is likewise about
    propositions; so that its object is something complex.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The thing known is in the knower according to
    the mode of the knower. Now the mode proper to the human intellect is to
    know the truth by synthesis and analysis, as stated in the FP, Question
    [85], Article [5]. Hence things that are simple in themselves, are known by
    the intellect with a certain amount of complexity, just as on the other
    hand, the Divine intellect knows, without any complexity, things that are
    complex in themselves.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly the object of faith may be considered in two ways. First, as
    regards the thing itself which is believed, and thus the object of faith is
    something simple, namely the thing itself about which we have faith.
    Secondly, on the part of the believer, and in this respect the object of
    faith is something complex by way of a proposition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence in the past both opinions have been held with a certain amount of
    truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument considers the object of
    faith on the part of the thing believed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The symbol mentions the things about
    which faith is, in so far as the act of the believer is terminated in them,
    as is evident from the manner of speaking about them. Now the act of the
    believer does not terminate in a proposition, but in a thing. For as in
    science we do not form propositions, except in order to have knowledge about
    things through their means, so is it in faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The object of the heavenly vision will
    be the First Truth seen in itself, according to 1 Jn. 3:2: "We know that
    when He shall appear, we shall be like to Him: because we shall see Him as
    He is": hence that vision will not be by way of a proposition but by way of
    a simple understanding. On the other hand, by faith, we do not apprehend the
    First Truth as it is in itself. Hence the comparison fails.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether anything false can come under faith?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that something false can come under
    faith. For faith is condivided with hope and charity. Now something false
    can come under hope, since many hope to have eternal life, who will not
    obtain it. The same may be said of charity, for many are loved as being
    good, who, nevertheless, are not good. Therefore something false can be the
    object of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Abraham believed that Christ would be
    born, according to Jn. 8:56: "Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see
    My day: he saw it, and was glad." But after the time of Abraham, God might
    not have taken flesh, for it was merely because He willed that He did, so
    that what Abraham believed about Christ would have been false. Therefore the
    object of faith can be something false.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the ancients believed in the future
    birth of Christ, and many continued so to believe, until they heard the
    preaching of the Gospel. Now, when once Christ was born, even before He
    began to preach, it was false that Christ was yet to be born. Therefore
    something false can come under faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is a matter of faith, that one should
    believe that the true Body of Christ is contained in the Sacrament of the
    altar. But it might happen that the bread was not rightly consecrated, and
    that there was not Christ's true Body there, but only bread. Therefore
    something false can come under faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> No virtue that perfects the intellect is
    related to the false, considered as the evil of the intellect, as the
    Philosopher declares (Ethic. vi, 2). Now faith is a virtue that perfects the
    intellect, as we shall show further on (<a href="SS004.html#SSQ4OUTP1"
      >Question [4]</a
    >, <a href="SS004.html#SSQ4ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,5). Therefore nothing
    false can come under it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Nothing comes under any power, habit or act,
    except by means of the formal aspect of the object: thus color cannot be
    seen except by means of light, and a conclusion cannot be known save through
    the mean of demonstration. Now it has been stated (<a
      href="SS001.html#SSQ1A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >) that the formal aspect of the object of faith is the First Truth; so that
    nothing can come under faith, save in so far as it stands under the First
    Truth, under which nothing false can stand, as neither can non-being stand
    under being, nor evil under goodness. It follows therefore that nothing
    false can come under faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since the true is the good of the
    intellect, but not of the appetitive power, it follows that all virtues
    which perfect the intellect, exclude the false altogether, because it
    belongs to the nature of a virtue to bear relation to the good alone. On the
    other hand those virtues which perfect the appetitive faculty, do not
    entirely exclude the false, for it is possible to act in accordance with
    justice or temperance, while having a false opinion about what one is doing.
    Therefore, as faith perfects the intellect, whereas hope and charity perfect
    the appetitive part, the comparison between them fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless neither can anything false come under hope, for a man hopes to
    obtain eternal life, not by his own power (since this would be an act of
    presumption), but with the help of grace; and if he perseveres therein he
    will obtain eternal life surely and infallibly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In like manner it belongs to charity to love God, wherever He may be; so
    that it matters not to charity, whether God be in the individual whom we
    love for God's sake.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That "God would not take flesh,"
    considered in itself was possible even after Abraham's time, but in so far
    as it stands in God's foreknowledge, it has a certain necessity of
    infallibility, as explained in the FP, Question [14], Articles [13],15: and
    it is thus that it comes under faith. Hence in so far as it comes under
    faith, it cannot be false.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> After Christ's birth, to believe in Him,
    was to believe in Christ's birth at some time or other. The fixing of the
    time, wherein some were deceived was not due to their faith, but to a human
    conjecture. For it is possible for a believer to have a false opinion
    through a human conjecture, but it is quite impossible for a false opinion
    to be the outcome of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The faith of the believer is not
    directed to such and such accidents of bread, but to the fact that the true
    body of Christ is under the appearances of sensible bread, when it is
    rightly consecrated. Hence if it be not rightly consecrated, it does not
    follow that anything false comes under faith.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the object of faith can be something seen?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the object of faith is
    something seen. For Our Lord said to Thomas (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++20%3A29"
      >Jn. 20:29</a
    >): "Because thou hast seen Me, Thomas, thou hast believed." Therefore
    vision and faith regard the same object.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle, while speaking of the
    knowledge of faith, says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++13%3A12"
      >1 Cor. 13:12</a
    >): "We see now through a glass in a dark manner." Therefore what is
    believed is seen.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, faith is a spiritual light. Now
    something is seen under every light. Therefore faith is of things seen.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, "Every sense is a kind of sight," as
    Augustine states (De Verb. Domini, Serm. xxxiii). But faith is of things
    heard, according to Rm. 10:17: "Faith... cometh by hearing." Therefore faith
    is of things seen.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A1"
      >Heb. 11:1</a
    >) that "faith is the evidence of things that appear not."
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Faith implies assent of the intellect to that
    which is believed. Now the intellect assents to a thing in two ways. First,
    through being moved to assent by its very object, which is known either by
    itself (as in the case of first principles, which are held by the habit of
    understanding), or through something else already known (as in the case of
    conclusions which are held by the habit of science). Secondly the intellect
    assents to something, not through being sufficiently moved to this assent by
    its proper object, but through an act of choice, whereby it turns
    voluntarily to one side rather than to the other: and if this be accompanied
    by doubt or fear of the opposite side, there will be opinion, while, if
    there be certainty and no fear of the other side, there will be faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now those things are said to be seen which, of themselves, move the
    intellect or the senses to knowledge of them. Wherefore it is evident that
    neither faith nor opinion can be of things seen either by the senses or by
    the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Thomas "saw one thing, and believed
    another" [*St. Gregory: Hom. xxvi in Evang.]: he saw the Man, and believing
    Him to be God, he made profession of his faith, saying: "My Lord and my
    God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those things which come under faith can
    be considered in two ways. First, in particular; and thus they cannot be
    seen and believed at the same time, as shown above. Secondly, in general,
    that is, under the common aspect of credibility; and in this way they are
    seen by the believer. For he would not believe unless, on the evidence of
    signs, or of something similar, he saw that they ought to be believed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The light of faith makes us see what we
    believe. For just as, by the habits of the other virtues, man sees what is
    becoming to him in respect of that habit, so, by the habit of faith, the
    human mind is directed to assent to such things as are becoming to a right
    faith, and not to assent to others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>

    Whether those things that are of faith can be an object of science [*Science
    is certain knowledge of a demonstrated conclusion through its
    demonstration]?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that those things that are of faith
    can be an object of science. For where science is lacking there is
    ignorance, since ignorance is the opposite of science. Now we are not in
    ignorance of those things we have to believe, since ignorance of such things
    savors of unbelief, according to 1 Tim. 1:13: "I did it ignorantly in
    unbelief." Therefore things that are of faith can be an object of
    science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, science is acquired by reasons. Now
    sacred writers employ reasons to inculcate things that are of faith.
    Therefore such things can be an object of science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things which are demonstrated are an
    object of science, since a "demonstration is a syllogism that produces
    science." Now certain matters of faith have been demonstrated by the
    philosophers, such as the Existence and Unity of God, and so forth.
    Therefore things that are of faith can be an object of science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, opinion is further from science than
    faith is, since faith is said to stand between opinion and science. Now
    opinion and science can, in a way, be about the same object, as stated in
    Poster. i. Therefore faith and science can be about the same object also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Hom. xxvi in Evang.) that "when
    a thing is manifest, it is the object, not of faith, but of perception."
    Therefore things that are of faith are not the object of perception, whereas
    what is an object of science is the object of perception. Therefore there
    can be no faith about things which are an object of science.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> All science is derived from self-evident and
    therefore "seen" principles; wherefore all objects of science must needs be,
    in a fashion, seen.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now as stated above (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), it
    is impossible that one and the same thing should be believed and seen by the
    same person. Hence it is equally impossible for one and the same thing to be
    an object of science and of belief for the same person. It may happen,
    however, that a thing which is an object of vision or science for one, is
    believed by another: since we hope to see some day what we now believe about
    the Trinity, according to 1 Cor. 13:12: "We see now through a glass in a
    dark manner; but then face to face": which vision the angels possess
    already; so that what we believe, they see. In like manner it may happen
    that what is an object of vision or scientific knowledge for one man, even
    in the state of a wayfarer, is, for another man, an object of faith, because
    he does not know it by demonstration.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless that which is proposed to be believed equally by all, is
    equally unknown by all as an object of science: such are the things which
    are of faith simply. Consequently faith and science are not about the same
    things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Unbelievers are in ignorance of things
    that are of faith, for neither do they see or know them in themselves, nor
    do they know them to be credible. The faithful, on the other hand, know
    them, not as by demonstration, but by the light of faith which makes them
    see that they ought to believe them, as stated above (<a
      href="SS001.html#SSQ1A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >, ad 2,3).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The reasons employed by holy men to
    prove things that are of faith, are not demonstrations; they are either
    persuasive arguments showing that what is proposed to our faith is not
    impossible, or else they are proofs drawn from the principles of faith, i.e.
    from the authority of Holy Writ, as Dionysius declares (Div. Nom. ii).
    Whatever is based on these principles is as well proved in the eyes of the
    faithful, as a conclusion drawn from self-evident principles is in the eyes
    of all. Hence again, theology is a science, as we stated at the outset of
    this work (<a href="../FP.html">FP</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP001.html#FPQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="../FP/FP001.html#FPQ1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Things which can be proved by
    demonstration are reckoned among the articles of faith, not because they are
    believed simply by all, but because they are a necessary presupposition to
    matters of faith, so that those who do not known them by demonstration must
    know them first of all by faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Poster. i),
    "science and opinion about the same object can certainly be in different
    men," as we have stated above about science and faith; yet it is possible
    for one and the same man to have science and faith about the same thing
    relatively, i.e. in relation to the object, but not in the same respect. For
    it is possible for the same person, about one and the same object, to know
    one thing and to think another: and, in like manner, one may know by
    demonstration the unity of the Godhead, and, by faith, the Trinity. On the
    other hand, in one and the same man, about the same object, and in the same
    respect, science is incompatible with either opinion or faith, yet for
    different reasons. Because science is incompatible with opinion about the
    same object simply, for the reason that science demands that its object
    should be deemed impossible to be otherwise, whereas it is essential to
    opinion, that its object should be deemed possible to be otherwise. Yet that
    which is the object of faith, on account of the certainty of faith, is also
    deemed impossible to be otherwise; and the reason why science and faith
    cannot be about the same object and in the same respect is because the
    object of science is something seen whereas the object of faith is the
    unseen, as stated above.<br />

    Whether those things that are of faith should be divided into certain
    articles?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that those things that are of faith
    should not be divided into certain articles. For all things contained in
    Holy Writ are matters of faith. But these, by reason of their multitude,
    cannot be reduced to a certain number. Therefore it seems superfluous to
    distinguish certain articles of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, material differences can be multiplied
    indefinitely, and therefore art should take no notice of them. Now the
    formal aspect of the object of faith is one and indivisible, as stated above
    (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), viz. the First Truth, so
    that matters of faith cannot be distinguished in respect of their formal
    object. Therefore no notice should be taken of a material division of
    matters of faith into articles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it has been said by some [*Cf. William
    of Auxerre, Summa Aurea] that "an article is an indivisible truth concerning
    God, exacting [arctans] our belief." Now belief is a voluntary act, since,
    as Augustine says (Tract. xxvi in Joan.), "no man believes against his
    will." Therefore it seems that matters of faith should not be divided into
    articles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says: "An article is a glimpse of
    Divine truth, tending thereto." Now we can only get a glimpse of Divine
    truth by way of analysis, since things which in God are one, are manifold in
    our intellect. Therefore matters of faith should be divided into
    articles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> the word "article" is apparently derived from
    the Greek; for the Greek {arthron} [*Cf. William of Auxerre, Summa Aurea]
    which the Latin renders "articulus," signifies a fitting together of
    distinct parts: wherefore the small parts of the body which fit together are
    called the articulations of the limbs. Likewise, in the Greek grammar,
    articles are parts of speech which are affixed to words to show their
    gender, number or case. Again in rhetoric, articles are parts that fit
    together in a sentence, for Tully says (Rhet. iv) that an article is
    composed of words each pronounced singly and separately, thus: "Your
    passion, your voice, your look, have struck terror into your foes."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence matters of Christian faith are said to contain distinct articles, in
    so far as they are divided into parts, and fit together. Now the object of
    faith is something unseen in connection with God, as stated above (<a
      href="SS001.html#SSQ1A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >). Consequently any matter that, for a special reason, is unseen, is a
    special article; whereas when several matters are known or not known, under
    the same aspect, we are not to distinguish various articles. Thus one
    encounters one difficulty in seeing that God suffered, and another in seeing
    that He rose again from the dead, wherefore the article of the Resurrection
    is distinct from the article of the Passion. But that He suffered, died and
    was buried, present the same difficulty, so that if one be accepted, it is
    not difficult to accept the others; wherefore all these belong to one
    article.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some things are proposed to our belief
    are in themselves of faith, while others are of faith, not in themselves but
    only in relation to others: even as in sciences certain propositions are put
    forward on their own account, while others are put forward in order to
    manifest others. Now, since the chief object of faith consists in those
    things which we hope to see, according to Heb. 11:2: "Faith is the substance
    of things to be hoped for," it follows that those things are in themselves
    of faith, which order us directly to eternal life. Such are the Trinity of
    Persons in Almighty God [*The Leonine Edition reads: The Three Persons, the
    omnipotence of God, etc.], the mystery of Christ's Incarnation, and the
    like: and these are distinct articles of faith. On the other hand certain
    things in Holy Writ are proposed to our belief, not chiefly on their own
    account, but for the manifestation of those mentioned above: for instance,
    that Abraham had two sons, that a dead man rose again at the touch of
    Eliseus' bones, and the like, which are related in Holy Writ for the purpose
    of manifesting the Divine mystery or the Incarnation of Christ: and such
    things should not form distinct articles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The formal aspect of the object of faith
    can be taken in two ways: first, on the part of the thing believed, and thus
    there is one formal aspect of all matters of faith, viz. the First Truth:
    and from this point of view there is no distinction of articles. Secondly,
    the formal aspect of matters of faith, can be considered from our point of
    view; and thus the formal aspect of a matter of faith is that it is
    something unseen; and from this point of view there are various distinct
    articles of faith, as we saw above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This definition of an article is taken
    from an etymology of the word as derived from the Latin, rather than in
    accordance with its real meaning, as derived from the Greek: hence it does
    not carry much weight. Yet even then it could be said that although faith is
    exacted of no man by a necessity of coercion, since belief is a voluntary
    act, yet it is exacted of him by a necessity of end, since "he that cometh
    to God must believe that He is," and "without faith it is impossible to
    please God," as the Apostle declares (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A6"

    Whether the articles of faith have increased in course of time?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the articles of faith have not
    increased in course of time. Because, as the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A1"
      >Heb. 11:1</a
    >), "faith is the substance of things to be hoped for." Now the same things
    are to be hoped for at all times. Therefore, at all times, the same things
    are to be believed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, development has taken place, in sciences
    devised by man, on account of the lack of knowledge in those who discovered
    them, as the Philosopher observes (Metaph. ii). Now the doctrine of faith
    was not devised by man, but was delivered to us by God, as stated in Eph.
    2:8: "It is the gift of God." Since then there can be no lack of knowledge
    in God, it seems that knowledge of matters of faith was perfect from the
    beginning and did not increase as time went on.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the operation of grace proceeds in
    orderly fashion no less than the operation of nature. Now nature always
    makes a beginning with perfect things, as Boethius states (De Consol. iii).
    Therefore it seems that the operation of grace also began with perfect
    things, so that those who were the first to deliver the faith, knew it most
    perfectly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, just as the faith of Christ was
    delivered to us through the apostles, so too, in the Old Testament, the
    knowledge of faith was delivered by the early fathers to those who came
    later, according to Dt. 32:7: "Ask thy father, and he will declare to thee."
    Now the apostles were most fully instructed about the mysteries, for "they
    received them more fully than others, even as they received them earlier,"
    as a gloss says on Rm. 8:23: "Ourselves also who have the first fruits of
    the Spirit." Therefore it seems that knowledge of matters of faith has not
    increased as time went on.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Hom. xvi in Ezech.) that "the
    knowledge of the holy fathers increased as time went on... and the nearer
    they were to Our Savior's coming, the more fully did they received the
    mysteries of salvation."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The articles of faith stand in the same
    relation to the doctrine of faith, as self-evident principles to a teaching
    based on natural reason. Among these principles there is a certain order, so
    that some are contained implicitly in others; thus all principles are
    reduced, as to their first principle, to this one: "The same thing cannot be
    affirmed and denied at the same time," as the Philosopher states (Metaph.
    iv, text. 9). In like manner all the articles are contained implicitly in
    certain primary matters of faith, such as God's existence, and His
    providence over the salvation of man, according to Heb. 11: "He that cometh
    to God, must believe that He is, and is a rewarder to them that seek Him."
    For the existence of God includes all that we believe to exist in God
    eternally, and in these our happiness consists; while belief in His
    providence includes all those things which God dispenses in time, for man's
    salvation, and which are the way to that happiness: and in this way, again,
    some of those articles which follow from these are contained in others: thus
    faith in the Redemption of mankind includes belief in the Incarnation of
    Christ, His Passion and so forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly we must conclude that, as regards the substance of the articles
    of faith, they have not received any increase as time went on: since
    whatever those who lived later have believed, was contained, albeit
    implicitly, in the faith of those Fathers who preceded them. But there was
    an increase in the number of articles believed explicitly, since to those
    who lived in later times some were known explicitly which were not known
    explicitly by those who lived before them. Hence the Lord said to Moses (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++6%3A2,3"
      >Ex. 6:2,3</a
    >): "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob [*Vulg.: 'I
    am the Lord that appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob']... and My
    name Adonai I did not show them": David also said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++118%3A100"
      >Ps. 118:100</a
    >): "I have had understanding above ancients": and the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++3%3A5"
      >Eph. 3:5</a
    >) that the mystery of Christ, "in other generations was not known, as it is
    now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Among men the same things were always to
    be hoped for from Christ. But as they did not acquire this hope save through
    Christ, the further they were removed from Christ in point of time, the
    further they were from obtaining what they hoped for. Hence the Apostle says
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A13">Heb. 11:13</a
    >): "All these died according to faith, not having received the promises,
    but beholding them afar off." Now the further off a thing is the less
    distinctly is it seen; wherefore those who were nigh to Christ's advent had
    a more distinct knowledge of the good things to be hoped for.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Progress in knowledge occurs in two
    ways. First, on the part of the teacher, be he one or many, who makes
    progress in knowledge as time goes on: and this is the kind of progress that
    takes place in sciences devised by man. Secondly, on the part of the
    learner; thus the master, who has perfect knowledge of the art, does not
    deliver it all at once to his disciple from the very outset, for he would
    not be able to take it all in, but he condescends to the disciple's capacity
    and instructs him little by little. It is in this way that men made progress
    in the knowledge of faith as time went on. Hence the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A24"
      >Gal. 3:24</a
    >) compares the state of the Old Testament to childhood.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Two causes are requisite before actual
    generation can take place, an agent, namely, and matter. In the order of the
    active cause, the more perfect is naturally first; and in this way nature
    makes a beginning with perfect things, since the imperfect is not brought to
    perfection, except by something perfect already in existence. On the other
    hand, in the order of the material cause, the imperfect comes first, and in
    this way nature proceeds from the imperfect to the perfect. Now in the
    manifestation of faith, God is the active cause, having perfect knowledge
    from all eternity; while man is likened to matter in receiving the influx of
    God's action. Hence, among men, the knowledge of faith had to proceed from
    imperfection to perfection; and, although some men have been after the
    manner of active causes, through being doctors of faith, nevertheless the
    manifestation of the Spirit is given to such men for the common good,
    according to 1 Cor. 12:7; so that the knowledge of faith was imparted to the
    Fathers who were instructors in the faith, so far as was necessary at the
    time for the instruction of the people, either openly or in figures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The ultimate consummation of grace was
    effected by Christ, wherefore the time of His coming is called the "time of
    fulness [*Vulg.: 'fulness of time']" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++4%3A4"
      >Gal. 4:4</a
    >). Hence those who were nearest to Christ, wherefore before, like John the
    Baptist, or after, like the apostles, had a fuller knowledge of the
    mysteries of faith; for even with regard to man's state we find that the
    perfection of manhood comes in youth, and that a man's state is all the more
    perfect, whether before or after, the nearer it is to the time of his
    youth.<br />

    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the articles of faith are
    unsuitably formulated. For those things, which can be known by
    demonstration, do not belong to faith as to an object of belief for all, as
    stated above (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Now it can
    be known by demonstration that there is one God; hence the Philosopher
    proves this (Metaph. xii, text. 52) and many other philosophers demonstrated
    the same truth. Therefore that "there is one God" should not be set down as
    an article of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as it is necessary to faith that we
    should believe God to be almighty, so is it too that we should believe Him
    to be "all-knowing" and "provident for all," about both of which points some
    have erred. Therefore, among the articles of faith, mention should have been
    made of God's wisdom and providence, even as of His omnipotence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to know the Father is the same things as
    to know the Son, according to Jn. 14:9: "He that seeth Me, seeth the Father
    also." Therefore there ought to be but one article about the Father and Son,
    and, for the same reason, about the Holy Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the Person of the Father is no less than
    the Person of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Now there are several articles
    about the Person of the Holy Ghost, and likewise about the Person of the
    Son. Therefore there should be several articles about the Person of the
    Father.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, just as certain things are said by
    appropriation, of the Person of the Father and of the Person of the Holy
    Ghost, so too is something appropriated to the Person of the Son, in respect
    of His Godhead. Now, among the articles of faith, a place is given to a work
    appropriated to the Father, viz. the creation, and likewise, a work
    appropriated to the Holy Ghost, viz. that "He spoke by the prophets."
    Therefore the articles of faith should contain some work appropriated to the
    Son in respect of His Godhead.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, the sacrament of the Eucharist presents
    a special difficulty over and above the other articles. Therefore it should
    have been mentioned in a special article: and consequently it seems that
    there is not a sufficient number of articles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the contrary stands the authority of the Church who formulates the
    articles thus.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS001.html#SSQ1ATHEP1"
      >Articles [4]</a
    >,6), to faith those things in themselves belong, the sight of which we
    shall enjoy in eternal life, and by which we are brought to eternal life.
    Now two things are proposed to us to be seen in eternal life: viz. the
    secret of the Godhead, to see which is to possess happiness; and the mystery
    of Christ's Incarnation, "by Whom we have access" to the glory of the sons
    of God, according to Rm. 5:2. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++17%3A3"
      >Jn. 17:3</a
    >): "This is eternal life: that they may know Thee, the... true God, and
    Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent." Wherefore the first distinction in
    matters of faith is that some concern the majesty of the Godhead, while
    others pertain to the mystery of Christ's human nature, which is the
    "mystery of godliness" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++3%3A16"
      >1 Tim. 3:16</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now with regard to the majesty of the Godhead, three things are proposed to
    our belief: first, the unity of the Godhead, to which the first article
    refers; secondly, the trinity of the Persons, to which three articles refer,
    corresponding to the three Persons; and thirdly, the works proper to the
    Godhead, the first of which refers to the order of nature, in relation to
    which the article about the creation is proposed to us; the second refers to
    the order of grace, in relation to which all matters concerning the
    sanctification of man are included in one article; while the third refers to
    the order of glory, and in relation to this another article is proposed to
    us concerning the resurrection of the dead and life everlasting. Thus there
    are seven articles referring to the Godhead.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In like manner, with regard to Christ's human nature, there are seven
    articles, the first of which refers to Christ's incarnation or conception;
    the second, to His virginal birth; the third, to His Passion, death and
    burial; the fourth, to His descent into hell; the fifth, to His
    resurrection; the sixth, to His ascension; the seventh, to His coming for
    the judgment, so that in all there are fourteen articles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Some, however, distinguish twelve articles, six pertaining to the Godhead,
    and six to the humanity. For they include in one article the three about the
    three Persons; because we have one knowledge of the three Persons: while
    they divide the article referring to the work of glorification into two,
    viz. the resurrection of the body, and the glory of the soul. Likewise they
    unite the conception and nativity into one article.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By faith we hold many truths about God,
    which the philosophers were unable to discover by natural reason, for
    instance His providence and omnipotence, and that He alone is to be
    worshiped, all of which are contained in the one article of the unity of
    God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The very name of the Godhead implies a
    kind of watching over things, as stated in the FP, Question [13], Article
    [8]. Now in beings having an intellect, power does not work save by the will
    and knowledge. Hence God's omnipotence includes, in a way, universal
    knowledge and providence. For He would not be able to do all He wills in
    things here below, unless He knew them, and exercised His providence over
    them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> We have but one knowledge of the Father,
    Son, and Holy Ghost, as to the unity of the Essence, to which the first
    article refers: but, as to the distinction of the Persons, which is by the
    relations of origin, knowledge of the Father does indeed, in a way, include
    knowledge of the Son, for He would not be Father, had He not a Son; the bond
    whereof being the Holy Ghost. From this point of view, there was a
    sufficient motive for those who referred one article to the three Persons.
    Since, however, with regard to each Person, certain points have to be
    observed, about which some happen to fall into error, looking at it in this
    way, we may distinguish three articles about the three Persons. For Arius
    believed in the omnipotence and eternity of the Father, but did not believe
    the Son to be co-equal and consubstantial with the Father; hence the need
    for an article about the Person of the Son in order to settle this point. In
    like manner it was necessary to appoint a third article about the Person of
    the Holy Ghost, against Macedonius. In the same way Christ's conception and
    birth, just as the resurrection and life everlasting, can from one point of
    view be united together in one article, in so far as they are ordained to
    one end; while, from another point of view, they can be distinct articles,
    in as much as each one separately presents a special difficulty.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> It belongs to the Son and Holy Ghost to
    be sent to sanctify the creature; and about this several things have to be
    believed. Hence it is that there are more articles about the Persons of the
    Son and Holy Ghost than about the Person of the Father, Who is never sent,
    as we stated in the FP, Question [43], Article [4].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The sanctification of a creature by
    grace, and its consummation by glory, is also effected by the gift of
    charity, which is appropriated to the Holy Ghost, and by the gift of wisdom,
    which is appropriated to the Son: so that each work belongs by
    appropriation, but under different aspects, both to the Son and to the Holy
    Ghost.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Two things may be considered in the
    sacrament of the Eucharist. One is the fact that it is a sacrament, and in
    this respect it is like the other effects of sanctifying grace. The other is
    that Christ's body is miraculously contained therein and thus it is included
    under God's omnipotence, like all other miracles which are ascribed to God's
    almighty power.<br />

    Whether it is suitable for the articles of faith to be embodied in a
    symbol?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is unsuitable for the
    articles of faith to be embodied in a symbol. Because Holy Writ is the rule
    of faith, to which no addition or subtraction can lawfully be made, since it
    is written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++4%3A2"
      >Dt. 4:2</a
    >): "You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall you
    take away from it." Therefore it was unlawful to make a symbol as a rule of
    faith, after the Holy Writ had once been published.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++4%3A5"
      >Eph. 4:5</a
    >) there is but "one faith." Now the symbol is a profession of faith.
    Therefore it is not fitting that there should be more than one symbol.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the confession of faith, which is
    contained in the symbol, concerns all the faithful. Now the faithful are not
    all competent to believe in God, but only those who have living faith.
    Therefore it is unfitting for the symbol of faith to be expressed in the
    words: "I believe in one God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the descent into hell is one of the
    articles of faith, as stated above (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A8THEP1"
      >Article [8]</a
    >). But the descent into hell is not mentioned in the symbol of the Fathers.
    Therefore the latter is expressed inadequately.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Augustine (Tract. xxix in Joan.)
    expounding the passage, "You believe in God, believe also in Me" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++14%3A1"
      >Jn. 14:1</a
    >) says: "We believe Peter or Paul, but we speak only of believing 'in'
    God." Since then the Catholic Church is merely a created being, it seems
    unfitting to say: "In the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, a symbol is drawn up that it may be a
    rule of faith. Now a rule of faith ought to be proposed to all, and that
    publicly. Therefore every symbol, besides the symbol of the Fathers, should
    be sung at Mass. Therefore it seems unfitting to publish the articles of
    faith in a symbol.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The universal Church cannot err, since she is
    governed by the Holy Ghost, Who is the Spirit of truth: for such was Our
    Lord's promise to His disciples (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++16%3A13"
      >Jn. 16:13</a
    >): "When He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will teach you all truth."
    Now the symbol is published by the authority of the universal Church.
    Therefore it contains nothing defective.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A6"
      >Heb. 11:6</a
    >), "he that cometh to God, must believe that He is." Now a man cannot
    believe, unless the truth be proposed to him that he may believe it. Hence
    the need for the truth of faith to be collected together, so that it might
    the more easily be proposed to all, lest anyone might stray from the truth
    through ignorance of the faith. It is from its being a collection of maxims
    of faith that the symbol [*The Greek {symballein}] takes its name.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The truth of faith is contained in Holy
    Writ, diffusely, under various modes of expression, and sometimes obscurely,
    so that, in order to gather the truth of faith from Holy Writ, one needs
    long study and practice, which are unattainable by all those who require to
    know the truth of faith, many of whom have no time for study, being busy
    with other affairs. And so it was necessary to gather together a clear
    summary from the sayings of Holy Writ, to be proposed to the belief of all.
    This indeed was no addition to Holy Writ, but something taken from it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The same doctrine of faith is taught in
    all the symbols. Nevertheless, the people need more careful instruction
    about the truth of faith, when errors arise, lest the faith of simple-minded
    persons be corrupted by heretics. It was this that gave rise to the
    necessity of formulating several symbols, which nowise differ from one
    another, save that on account of the obstinacy of heretics, one contains
    more explicitly what another contains implicitly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The confession of faith is drawn up in a
    symbol in the person, as it were, of the whole Church, which is united
    together by faith. Now the faith of the Church is living faith; since such
    is the faith to be found in all those who are of the Church not only
    outwardly but also by merit. Hence the confession of faith is expressed in a
    symbol, in a manner that is in keeping with living faith, so that even if
    some of the faithful lack living faith, they should endeavor to acquire
    it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> No error about the descent into hell had
    arisen among heretics, so that there was no need to be more explicit on that
    point. For this reason it is not repeated in the symbol of the Fathers, but
    is supposed as already settled in the symbol of the Apostles. For a
    subsequent symbol does not cancel a preceding one; rather does it expound
    it, as stated above (ad 2).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> If we say: "'In' the holy Catholic
    Church," this must be taken as verified in so far as our faith is directed
    to the Holy Ghost, Who sanctifies the Church; so that the sense is: "I
    believe in the Holy Ghost sanctifying the Church." But it is better and more
    in keeping with the common use, to omit the 'in,' and say simply, "the holy
    Catholic Church," as Pope Leo [*Rufinus, Comm. in Sym. Apost.] observes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Since the symbol of the Fathers is an
    explanation of the symbol of the Apostles, and was drawn up after the faith
    was already spread abroad, and when the Church was already at peace, it is
    sung publicly in the Mass. On the other hand the symbol of the Apostles,
    which was drawn up at the time of persecution, before the faith was made
    public, is said secretly at Prime and Compline, as though it were against
    the darkness of past and future errors.<br />

    Whether it belongs to the Sovereign Pontiff to draw up a symbol of faith?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it does not belong to the
    Sovereign Pontiff to draw up a symbol of faith. For a new edition of the
    symbol becomes necessary in order to explain the articles of faith, as
    stated above (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>). Now, in the
    Old Testament, the articles of faith were more and more explained as time
    went on, by reason of the truth of faith becoming clearer through greater
    nearness to Christ, as stated above (<a href="SS001.html#SSQ1A7THEP1"
      >Article [7]</a
    >). Since then this reason ceased with the advent of the New Law, there is
    no need for the articles of faith to be more and more explicit. Therefore it
    does not seem to belong to the authority of the Sovereign Pontiff to draw up
    a new edition of the symbol.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no man has the power to do what is
    forbidden under pain of anathema by the universal Church. Now it was
    forbidden under pain of anathema by the universal Church, to make a new
    edition of the symbol. For it is stated in the acts of the first* council of
    Ephesus (P. ii, Act. 6) that "after the symbol of the Nicene council had
    been read through, the holy synod decreed that it was unlawful to utter,
    write or draw up any other creed, than that which was defined by the Fathers
    assembled at Nicaea together with the Holy Ghost," and this under pain of
    anathema. [*St. Thomas wrote 'first' (expunged by Nicolai) to distinguish it
    from the other council, A.D. 451, known as the "Latrocinium" and condemned
    by the Pope.] The same was repeated in the acts of the council of Chalcedon
    (P. ii, Act. 5). Therefore it seems that the Sovereign Pontiff has no
    authority to publish a new edition of the symbol.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Athanasius was not the Sovereign
    Pontiff, but patriarch of Alexandria, and yet he published a symbol which is
    sung in the Church. Therefore it does not seem to belong to the Sovereign
    Pontiff any more than to other bishops, to publish a new edition of the
    symbol.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The symbol was drawn us by a general council.
    Now such a council cannot be convoked otherwise than by the authority of the
    Sovereign Pontiff, as stated in the Decretals [*Dist. xvii, Can. 4,5].
    Therefore it belongs to the authority of the Sovereign Pontiff to draw up a
    symbol.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (OBJ 1), a new edition of the
    symbol becomes necessary in order to set aside the errors that may arise.
    Consequently to publish a new edition of the symbol belongs to that
    authority which is empowered to decide matters of faith finally, so that
    they may be held by all with unshaken faith. Now this belongs to the
    authority of the Sovereign Pontiff, "to whom the more important and more
    difficult questions that arise in the Church are referred," as stated in the
    Decretals [*Dist. xvii, Can. 5]. Hence our Lord said to Peter whom he made
    Sovereign Pontiff (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++22%3A32"
      >Lk. 22:32</a
    >): "I have prayed for thee," Peter, "that thy faith fail not, and thou,
    being once converted, confirm thy brethren." The reason of this is that
    there should be but one faith of the whole Church, according to 1 Cor. 1:10:
    "That you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you":
    and this could not be secured unless any question of faith that may arise be
    decided by him who presides over the whole Church, so that the whole Church
    may hold firmly to his decision. Consequently it belongs to the sole
    authority of the Sovereign Pontiff to publish a new edition of the symbol,
    as do all other matters which concern the whole Church, such as to convoke a
    general council and so forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The truth of faith is sufficiently
    explicit in the teaching of Christ and the apostles. But since, according to
    2 Pt. 3:16, some men are so evil-minded as to pervert the apostolic teaching
    and other doctrines and Scriptures to their own destruction, it was
    necessary as time went on to express the faith more explicitly against the
    errors which arose.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This prohibition and sentence of the
    council was intended for private individuals, who have no business to decide
    matters of faith: for this decision of the general council did not take away
    from a subsequent council the power of drawing up a new edition of the
    symbol, containing not indeed a new faith, but the same faith with greater
    explicitness. For every council has taken into account that a subsequent
    council would expound matters more fully than the preceding council, if this
    became necessary through some heresy arising. Consequently this belongs to
    the Sovereign Pontiff, by whose authority the council is convoked, and its
    decision confirmed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Athanasius drew up a declaration of
    faith, not under the form of a symbol, but rather by way of an exposition of
    doctrine, as appears from his way of speaking. But since it contained
    briefly the whole truth of faith, it was accepted by the authority of the
    Sovereign Pontiff, so as to be considered as a rule of faith.<br />
