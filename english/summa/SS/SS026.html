<H3 Align="Center">OF THE ORDER OF CHARITY (THIRTEEN ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the order of charity, under which head there are 
thirteen points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there is an order in charity?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether man ought to love God more than his neighbor?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether more than himself?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether he ought to love himself more than his neighbor?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether man ought to love his neighbor more than his own body?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether he ought to love one neighbor more than another?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether he ought to love more, a neighbor who is better, or one who 
is more closely united to him?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether he ought to love more, one who is akin to him by blood, or 
one who is united to him by other ties?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether, out of charity, a man ought to love his son more than his 
father ?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A10THEP1">(10)</a> Whether he ought to love his mother more than his father?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A11THEP1">(11)</a> Whether he ought to love his wife more than his father or mother?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A12THEP1">(12)</a> Whether we ought to love those who are kind to us more than those 
whom we are kind to? 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A13THEP1">(13)</a> Whether the order of charity endures in heaven?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is no order in charity. For charity is a 
virtue. But no order is assigned to the other virtues. Neither, 
therefore, should any order be assigned to charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as the object of faith is the First Truth, so is 
the object of charity the Sovereign Good. Now no order is appointed for 
faith, but all things are believed equally. Neither, therefore, ought 
there to be any order in charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity is in the will: whereas ordering belongs, not to 
the will, but to the reason. Therefore no order should be ascribed to 
charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Cant 2:4): "He brought me into the 
cellar of wine, he set in order charity in me."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Metaph. v, text. 16), the terms 
"before" and "after" are used in reference to some principle. Now order 
implies that certain things are, in some way, before or after. Hence 
wherever there is a principle, there must needs be also order of some 
kind. But it has been said above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>) that the 
love of charity tends to God as to the principle of happiness, on the 
fellowship of which the friendship of charity is based. Consequently 
there must needs be some order in things loved out of charity, which 
order is in reference to the first principle of that love, which is God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Charity tends towards the last end considered as last end: 
and this does not apply to any other virtue, as stated above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Now the end has the character of principle in matters of appetite and 
action, as was shown above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>, ad 2; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A7A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1). Wherefore 
charity, above all, implies relation to the First Principle, and 
consequently, in charity above all, we find an order in reference to the 
First Principle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Faith pertains to the cognitive power, whose operation 
depends on the thing known being in the knower. On the other hand, 
charity is in an appetitive power, whose operation consists in the soul 
tending to things themselves. Now order is to be found in things 
themselves, and flows from them into our knowledge. Hence order is more 
appropriate to charity than to faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet there is a certain order in faith, in so far as it is chiefly 
about God, and secondarily about things referred to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Order belongs to reason as the faculty that orders, and to 
the appetitive power as to the faculty which is ordered. It is in this 
way that order is stated to be in charity.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether God ought to be loved more than our neighbor?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that God ought not to be loved more than our 
neighbor. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++4:20">1 Jn. 4:20</a>): "He that loveth not his brother 
whom he seeth, how can he love God, Whom he seeth not?" Whence it seems 
to follow that the more a thing is visible the more lovable it is, since 
loving begins with seeing, according to Ethic. ix, 5,12. Now God is less 
visible than our neighbor. Therefore He is less lovable, out of charity, 
than our neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, likeness causes love, according to Ecclus. 13:19: "Every 
beast loveth its like." Now man bears more likeness to his neighbor than 
to God. Therefore man loves his neighbor, out of charity, more than he 
loves God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what charity loves in a neighbor, is God, according to 
Augustine (De Doctr. Christ. i, 22,27). Now God is not greater in Himself 
than He is in our neighbor. Therefore He is not more to be loved in 
Himself than in our neighbor. Therefore we ought not to love God more 
than our neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A thing ought to be loved more, if others ought to be 
hated on its account. Now we ought to hate our neighbor for God's sake, 
if, to wit, he leads us astray from God, according to Lk. 14:26: "If any 
man come to Me and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, end 
children, and brethren, and sisters . . . he cannot be My disciple." 
Therefore we ought to love God, out of charity, more than our neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Each kind of friendship regards chiefly the subject in 
which we chiefly find the good on the fellowship of which that friendship 
is based: thus civil friendship regards chiefly the ruler of the state, 
on whom the entire common good of the state depends; hence to him before 
all, the citizens owe fidelity and obedience. Now the friendship of 
charity is based on the fellowship of happiness, which consists 
essentially in God, as the First Principle, whence it flows to all who 
are capable of happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore God ought to be loved chiefly and before all out of charity: 
for He is loved as the cause of happiness, whereas our neighbor is loved 
as receiving together with us a share of happiness from Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A thing is a cause of love in two ways: first, as being the 
reason for loving. In this way good is the cause of love, since each 
thing is loved according to its measure of goodness. Secondly, a thing 
causes love, as being a way to acquire love. It is in this way that 
seeing is the cause of loving, not as though a thing were lovable 
according as it is visible, but because by seeing a thing we are led to 
love it. Hence it does not follow that what is more visible is more 
lovable, but that as an object of love we meet with it before others: and 
that is the sense of the  Apostle's argument. For, since our neighbor is 
more visible to us, he is the first lovable object we meet with, because 
"the soul learns, from those things it knows, to love what it knows not," 
as Gregory says in a homily (In Evang. xi). Hence it can be argued that, 
if any man loves not his neighbor, neither does he love God, not because 
his neighbor is more lovable, but because he is the first thing to demand 
our love: and God is more lovable by reason of His greater goodness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The likeness we have to God precedes and causes the 
likeness we have to our neighbor: because from the very fact that we 
share along with our neighbor in something received from God, we become 
like to our neighbor. Hence by reason of this likeness we ought to love 
God more than we love our neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Considered in His substance, God is equally in all, in 
whomsoever He may be, for He is not lessened by being in anything. And 
yet our neighbor does not possess God's goodness equally with God, for 
God has it essentially, and our neighbor by participation.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether out of charity, man is bound to love God more than himself?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man is not bound, out of charity, to love God 
more than himself. For the Philosopher says (Ethic. ix, 8) that "a man's 
friendly relations with others arise from his friendly relations with 
himself." Now the cause is stronger than its effect. Therefore man's 
friendship towards himself is greater than his friendship for anyone 
else. Therefore he ought to love himself more than God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one loves a thing in so far as it is one's own good. Now 
the reason for loving a thing is more loved than the thing itself which 
is loved for that reason, even as the principles which are the reason for 
knowing a thing are more known. Therefore man loves himself more than any 
other good loved by him. Therefore he does not love God more than himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a man loves God as much as he loves to enjoy God. But a 
man loves himself as much as he loves to enjoy God; since this is the 
highest good a man can wish for himself. Therefore man is not bound, out 
of charity, to love God more than himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 22): "If thou 
oughtest to love thyself, not for thy own sake, but for the sake of Him 
in Whom is the rightest end of thy love, let no other man take offense if 
him also thou lovest for God's sake." Now "the cause of a thing being 
such is yet more so." Therefore man ought to love God more than himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The good we receive from God is twofold, the good of 
nature, and the good of grace. Now the fellowship of  natural goods 
bestowed on us by God is the foundation of natural love, in virtue of 
which not only man, so long as his nature remains unimpaired, loves God 
above all things and more than himself, but also every single creature, 
each in its own way, i.e. either by an intellectual, or by a rational, or 
by an animal, or at least by a natural love, as stones do, for instance, 
and other things bereft of knowledge, because each part naturally loves 
the common good of the whole more than its own particular good. This is 
evidenced by its operation, since the principal inclination of each part 
is towards common action conducive to the good of the whole. It may also 
be seen in civic virtues whereby sometimes the citizens suffer damage 
even to their own property and persons for the sake of the common good. 
Wherefore much more is this realized with regard to the friendship of 
charity which is based on the fellowship of the gifts of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore man ought, out of charity, to love God, Who is the common good 
of all, more than himself: since happiness is in God as in the universal 
and fountain principle of all who are able to have a share of that 
happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Philosopher is speaking of friendly relations towards 
another person in whom the good, which is the object of friendship, 
resides in some restricted way; and not of friendly relations with 
another in whom the aforesaid good resides in totality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The part does indeed love the good of the whole, as becomes 
a part, not however so as to refer the good of the whole to itself, but 
rather itself to the good of the whole.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That a man wishes to enjoy God pertains to that love of God 
which is love of concupiscence. Now we love God with the love of 
friendship more than with the love of concupiscence, because the Divine 
good is greater in itself, than our share of good in enjoying Him. Hence, 
out of charity, man simply loves God more than himself.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether our of charity, man ought to love himself more than his neighbor?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man ought not, out of charity, to love 
himself more than his neighbor. For the principal object of charity is 
God, as stated above (<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,12). Now sometimes our neighbor 
is more closely united to God than we are ourselves. Therefore we ought 
to love such a one more than ourselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the more we love a person, the more we avoid injuring 
him. Now a man, out of charity, submits to injury for his neighbor's 
sake, according to Prov. 12:26: "He that neglecteth a loss for the sake 
of a friend, is just." Therefore a man ought, out of charity, to love his 
neighbor more than himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13:5">1 Cor. 13:5</a>) "charity seeketh not its 
own." Now the thing we love most is the one whose good we seek most. 
Therefore a man does not, out of charity, love himself more than his 
neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Lev. 19:18, Mt. 22:39): "Thou shalt love 
thy neighbor (Lev. 19:18: 'friend') as thyself." Whence it seems to 
follow that man's love for himself is the model of his love for another. 
But the model exceeds the copy. Therefore, out of charity, a man ought to 
love himself more than his neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are two things in man, his spiritual nature and his 
corporeal nature. And a man is said to love himself by reason of his 
loving himself with regard to his spiritual nature, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>): so that accordingly, a man ought, out of charity, to love 
himself more than he loves any other person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is evident from the very reason for loving: since, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,12), God is loved as the principle of good, on which the 
love of charity is founded; while man, out of charity, loves himself by 
reason of his being a partaker of the aforesaid good, and loves his 
neighbor by reason of his fellowship in that good. Now fellowship is a 
reason for love according to a certain union in relation to God. 
Wherefore just as unity surpasses union, the fact that man himself has a 
share of the Divine good, is a more potent reason for loving than that 
another should be a partner with him in that share. Therefore man, out of 
charity, ought to love himself more than his neighbor: in sign whereof, a 
man ought not to give way to any evil of sin, which counteracts his share 
of happiness, not even that he may free his neighbor from sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The love of charity takes its quantity not only from its 
object which is God, but also from the lover, who is the man that has 
charity, even as the quantity of any action depends in some way on the 
subject. Wherefore, though a better neighbor is nearer to God, yet 
because he is not as near to the man who has charity, as this man is to 
himself, it does not follow that a man is bound to love his neighbor more 
than himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A man ought to bear bodily injury for his friend's sake, 
and precisely in so doing he loves himself more as regards his spiritual 
mind, because it pertains to the perfection of virtue, which is a good of 
the mind. In spiritual matters, however, man ought not to suffer injury 
by sinning, in order to free his neighbor from sin, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says in his Rule (Ep. ccxi), the saying, 
"'charity seeks not her own,' means that it prefers the common to the 
private good." Now the common good is always more lovable to the 
individual than his private good, even as the good of the whole is more 
lovable to the part, than the latter's own partial good, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man is not bound to love his neighbor more 
than his own body. For his neighbor includes his neighbor's body. If 
therefore a man ought to love his neighbor more than his own body, it 
follows that he ought to love his neighbor's body more than his own.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man ought to love his own soul more than his 
neighbor's, as stated above (<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now a man's own body is nearer to his 
soul than his neighbor. Therefore we ought to love our body more than our 
neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a man imperils that which he loves less for the sake of 
what he loves more. Now every man is not bound to imperil his own body 
for his neighbor's safety: this belongs to the perfect, according to Jn. 
15:13: "Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down his life 
for his friends." Therefore a man is not bound, out of charity, to love 
his neighbor more than his own body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 27) that "we ought 
to love our neighbor more than our own body."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Out of charity we ought to love more that which has more 
fully the reason for being loved out of charity, as stated above (<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>). Now fellowship in the full participation of happiness 
which is the reason for loving one's neighbor, is a greater reason for 
loving, than the participation of happiness by way of overflow, which is 
the reason for loving one's own body. Therefore, as regards the welfare 
of the soul we ought to love our neighbor more than our own body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. ix, 8) a thing seems 
to be that which is predominant in it: so that when we say that we ought 
to love our neighbor more than our own body, this refers to his soul, 
which is his predominant part.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Our body is nearer to our soul than our neighbor, as 
regards the constitution of our own nature: but as regards the 
participation of happiness, our neighbor's soul is more closely 
associated with our own soul, than even our own body is.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Every man is immediately concerned with the care of his own 
body, but not with his neighbor's welfare, except perhaps in cases of 
urgency: wherefore charity does not necessarily require a man to imperil 
his own body for his neighbor's welfare, except in a case where he is 
under obligation to do so and if a man of his own accord offer himself 
for that purpose, this belongs to the perfection of charity.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought not to love one neighbor more than 
another. For Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 28): "One ought to love 
all men equally. Since, however, one cannot do good to all, we ought to 
consider those chiefly who by reason of place, time or any other 
circumstance, by a kind of chance, are more closely united to us." 
Therefore one neighbor ought not to be loved more than another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, where there is one and the same reason for loving 
several, there should be no inequality of love. Now there is one and the 
same reason for loving all one's neighbors, which reason is God, as 
Augustine states (De Doctr. Christ. i, 27). Therefore we ought to love 
all our neighbors equally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to love a man is to wish him good things, as the 
Philosopher states (Rhet. ii, 4). Now to all our neighbors we wish an 
equal good, viz. everlasting life. Therefore we ought to love all our 
neighbors equally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> One's obligation to love a person is proportionate to 
the gravity of the sin one commits in acting against that love. Now it is 
a more grievous sin to act against the love of certain neighbors, than 
against the love of others. Hence the commandment (Lev. 10:9), "He that 
curseth his father or mother, dying let him die," which does not apply to 
those who cursed others than the above. Therefore we ought to love some 
neighbors more than others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[6] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There have been two opinions on this question: for some 
have said that we ought, out of charity, to love all our neighbors 
equally, as regards our affection, but not as regards the outward effect. 
They held that the order of love is to be understood as applying to 
outward favors, which we ought to confer on those who are connected with 
us in preference to those who are unconnected, and not to the inward 
affection, which ought to be given equally to all including our enemies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[6] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is unreasonable. For the affection of charity, which is the 
inclination of grace, is not less orderly than the natural appetite, 
which is the inclination of nature, for both inclinations flow from 
Divine wisdom. Now we observe in the physical order that the natural 
inclination in each thing is proportionate to the act or movement that is 
becoming to the nature of that thing: thus in earth the inclination of 
gravity is greater than in water, because it is becoming to earth to be 
beneath water. Consequently the inclination also of grace which is the 
effect of charity, must needs be proportionate to those actions which 
have to be performed outwardly, so that, to wit, the affection of our 
charity be more intense towards those to whom we ought to behave with 
greater kindness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[6] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must, therefore, say that, even as regards the affection we ought to 
love one neighbor more than another. The reason is that,  since the 
principle of love is God, and the person who loves, it must needs be that 
the affection of love increases in proportion to the nearness to one or 
the other of those principles. For as we stated above (<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), wherever we 
find a principle, order depends on relation to that principle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Love can be unequal in two ways: first on the part of the 
good we wish our friend. In this respect we love all men equally out of 
charity: because we wish them all one same generic good, namely 
everlasting happiness. Secondly love is said to be greater through its 
action being more intense: and in this way we ought not to love all 
equally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or we may reply that we have unequal love for certain persons in two 
ways: first, through our loving some and not loving others. As regards 
beneficence we are bound to observe this inequality, because we cannot do 
good to all: but as regards benevolence, love ought not to be thus 
unequal. The other inequality arises from our loving some more than 
others: and Augustine does not mean to exclude the latter inequality, but 
the former, as is evident from what he says of beneficence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Our neighbors are not all equally related to God; some are 
nearer to Him, by reason of their greater goodness, and those we ought, 
out of charity, to love more than those who are not so near to Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers the quantity of love on the part of 
the good which we wish our friends.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought to love those who are better more 
than those who are more closely united to us. For that which is in no way 
hateful seems more lovable than that which is hateful for some reason: 
just as a thing is all the whiter for having less black mixed with it. 
Now those who are connected with us are hateful for some reason, 
according to Lk. 14:26: "If any man come to Me, and hate not his father," 
etc. On the other hand good men are not hateful for any reason. Therefore 
it seems that we ought to love those who are better more than those who 
are more closely connected with us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by charity above all, man is likened to God. But God 
loves more the better man. Therefore man also, out of charity, ought to 
love the better man more than one who is more closely united to him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in every friendship that ought to be loved most which 
has most to do with the foundation of that friendship: for, by natural 
friendship we love most those who are connected with us by nature, our 
parents for instance, or our children. Now the friendship of charity is 
founded upon the fellowship of  happiness, which has more to do with 
better men than with those who are more closely united to us. Therefore, 
out of charity, we ought to love better men more than those who are more 
closely connected with us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++5:8">1 Tim. 5:8</a>): "If any man have not care 
of his own and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the 
faith, and is worse than an infidel." Now the inward affection of charity 
ought to correspond to the outward effect. Therefore charity regards 
those who are nearer to us before those who are better.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[7] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Every act should be proportionate both to its object and 
to the agent. But from its object it takes its species, while, from the 
power of the agent it takes the mode of its intensity: thus movement has 
its species from the term to which it tends, while the intensity of its 
speed arises from the disposition of the thing moved and the power of the 
mover. Accordingly love takes its species from its object, but its 
intensity is due to the lover.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[7] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the object of charity's love is God, and man is the lover. Therefore 
the specific diversity of the love which is in accordance with charity, 
as regards the love of our neighbor, depends on his relation to God, so 
that, out of charity, we should wish a greater good to one who is nearer 
to God; for though the good which charity wishes to all, viz. everlasting 
happiness, is one in itself, yet it has various degrees according to 
various shares of happiness, and it belongs to charity to wish God's 
justice to be maintained, in accordance with which better men have a 
fuller share of happiness. And this regards the species of love; for 
there are different species of love according to the different goods that 
we wish for those whom we love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[7] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the intensity of love is measured with regard to the 
man who loves, and accordingly man loves those who are more closely 
united to him, with more intense affection as to the good he wishes for 
them, than he loves those who are better as to the greater good he wishes 
for them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[7] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again a further difference must be observed here: for some neighbors are 
connected with us by their natural origin, a connection which cannot be 
severed, since that origin makes them to be what they are. But the 
goodness of virtue, wherein some are close to God, can come and go, 
increase and decrease, as was shown above (<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>, <A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,10,11). Hence it 
is possible for one, out of charity, to wish this man who is more closely 
united to one, to be better than another, and so reach a higher degree of 
happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[7] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover there is yet another reason for which, out of charity, we love 
more those who are more nearly connected with us, since we love them in 
more ways. For, towards those who are not connected with us we have no 
other friendship than charity, whereas for those who are connected with 
us, we have certain other  friendships, according to the way in which 
they are connected. Now since the good on which every other friendship of 
the virtuous is based, is directed, as to its end, to the good on which 
charity is based, it follows that charity commands each act of another 
friendship, even as the art which is about the end commands the art which 
is about the means. Consequently this very act of loving someone because 
he is akin or connected with us, or because he is a fellow-countryman or 
for any like reason that is referable to the end of charity, can be 
commanded by charity, so that, out of charity both eliciting and 
commanding, we love in more ways those who are more nearly connected with 
us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We are commanded to hate, in our kindred, not their 
kinship, but only the fact of their being an obstacle between us and God. 
In this respect they are not akin but hostile to us, according to Micah 
7:6: "A men's enemies are they of his own household."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Charity conforms man to God proportionately, by making man 
comport himself towards what is his, as God does towards what is His. For 
we may, out of charity, will certain things as becoming to us which God 
does not will, because it becomes Him not to will them, as stated above 
(<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS019.html#FSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS019.html#FSQ19A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>), when we were treating of the goodness of the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Charity elicits the act of love not only as regards the 
object, but also as regards the lover, as stated above. The result is 
that the man who is more nearly united to us is more loved.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought not to love more those who are more 
closely united to us by ties of blood. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++18:24">Prov. 18:24</a>): 
"A man amiable in society, shall be more friendly than a brother." Again, 
Valerius Maximus says (Fact. et Dict. Memor. iv 7): "The ties of 
friendship are most strong and in no way yield to the ties of blood." 
Moreover it is quite certain and undeniable, that as to the latter, the 
lot of birth is fortuitous, whereas we contract the former by an 
untrammelled will, and a solid pledge. Therefore we ought not to love 
more than others those who are united to us by ties of blood.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Ambrose says (De Officiis i, 7): "I love not less you 
whom I have begotten in the Gospel, than if I had begotten you in 
wedlock, for nature is no more eager to love than grace." Surely we ought 
to love those whom we expect to be with us for ever more than those who 
will be with us only in this world. Therefore we should not love our 
kindred more than those who are otherwise connected with us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "Love is proved by deeds," as Gregory states  (Hom. in 
Evang. xxx). Now we are bound to do acts of love to others than our 
kindred: thus in the army a man must obey his officer rather than his 
father. Therefore we are not bound to love our kindred most of all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The commandments of the decalogue contain a special 
precept about the honor due to our parents (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++20:12">Ex. 20:12</a>). Therefore we 
ought to love more specially those who are united to us by ties of blood.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[8] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), we ought out of charity to love 
those who are more closely united to us more, both because our love for 
them is more intense, and because there are more reasons for loving them. 
Now intensity of love arises from the union of lover and beloved: and 
therefore we should measure the love of different persons according to 
the different kinds of union, so that a man is more loved in matters 
touching that particular union in respect of which he is loved. And, 
again, in comparing love to love we should compare one union with 
another. Accordingly we must say that friendship among blood relations is 
based upon their connection by natural origin, the friendship of 
fellow-citizens on their civic fellowship, and the friendship of those 
who are fighting side by side on the comradeship of battle. Wherefore in 
matters pertaining to nature we should love our kindred most, in matters 
concerning relations between citizens, we should prefer our 
fellow-citizens, and on the battlefield our fellow-soldiers. Hence the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. ix, 2) that "it is our duty to render to each 
class of people such respect as is natural and appropriate. This is in 
fact the principle upon which we seem to act, for we invite our relations 
to a wedding . . . It would seem to be a special duty to afford our 
parents the means of living . . . and to honor them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[8] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The same applies to other kinds of friendship.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[8] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If however we compare union with union, it is evident that the union 
arising from natural origin is prior to, and more stable than, all 
others, because it is something affecting the very substance, whereas 
other unions supervene and may cease altogether. Therefore the friendship 
of kindred is more stable, while other friendships may be stronger in 
respect of that which is proper to each of them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In as much as the friendship of comrades originates through 
their own choice, love of this kind takes precedence of the love of 
kindred in matters where we are free to do as we choose, for instance in 
matters of action. Yet the friendship of kindred is more stable, since it 
is more natural, and preponderates over others in matters touching 
nature: consequently we are more beholden to them in the providing of

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Ambrose is speaking of love with regard to favors 
respecting the fellowship of grace, namely, moral instruction. For in 
this matter, a man ought to provide for his spiritual children  whom he 
has begotten spiritually, more than for the sons of his body, whom he is 
bound to support in bodily sustenance.<br>

battle.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that a man ought, out of charity, to love his children 
more than his father. For we ought to love those more to whom we are more 
bound to do good. Now we are more bound to do good to our children than 
to our parents, since the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++12:14">2 Cor. 12:14</a>): "Neither ought the 
children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children." 
Therefore a man ought to love his children more than his parents.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, grace perfects nature. But parents naturally love their 
children more than these love them, as the Philosopher states (Ethic. 
viii, 12). Therefore a man ought to love his children more than his 
parents.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man's affections are conformed to God by charity. But 
God loves His children more than they love Him. Therefore we also ought 
to love our children more than our parents.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose [*Origen, Hom. ii in Cant.] says: "We ought to 
love God first, then our parents, then our children, and lastly those of 
our household."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[9] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A4A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), the degrees of love 
may be measured from two standpoints. First, from that of the object. In 
this respect the better a thing is, and the more like to God, the more is 
it to be loved: and in this way a man ought to love his father more than 
his children, because, to wit, he loves his father as his principle, in 
which respect he is a more exalted good and more like God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[9] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the degrees of love may be measured from the standpoint of the 
lover, and in this respect a man loves more that which is more closely 
connected with him, in which way a man's children are more lovable to him 
than his father, as the Philosopher states (Ethic. viii). First, because 
parents love their children as being part of themselves, whereas the 
father is not part of his son, so that the love of a father for his 
children, is more like a man's love for himself. Secondly, because 
parents know better that so and so is their child than vice versa. 
Thirdly, because children are nearer to their parents, as being part of 
them, than their parents are to them to whom they stand in the relation 
of a principle. Fourthly, because parents have loved longer, for the 
father begins to love his child at once, whereas  the child begins to 
love his father after a lapse of time; and the longer love lasts, the 
stronger it is, according to Ecclus. 9:14: "Forsake not an old friend, 
for the new will not be like to him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[9] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The debt due to a principle is submission of respect and 
honor, whereas that due to the effect is one of influence and care. Hence 
the duty of children to their parents consists chiefly in honor: while 
that of parents to their children is especially one of care.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is natural for a man as father to love his children 
more, if we consider them as closely connected with him: but if we 
consider which is the more exalted good, the son naturally loves his 
father more.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 32), God loves us 
for our good and for His honor. Wherefore since our father is related to 
us as principle, even as God is, it belongs properly to the father to 
receive honor from his children, and to the children to be provided by 
their parents with what is good for them. Nevertheless in cases of 
necessity the child is bound out of the favors received to provide for 
his parents before all.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man ought to love his mother more than his 
father. For, as the Philosopher says (De Gener. Animal. i, 20), "the 
female produces the body in generation." Now man receives his soul, not 
from his father, but from God by creation, as stated in the FP, Question [90], 
Article [2]; Question [118]. Therefore a man receives more from his mother than from his 
father: and consequently he ought to love her more than him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, where greater love is given, greater love is due. Now a 
mother loves her child more than the father does: for the Philosopher 
says (Ethic. ix, 7) that "mothers have greater love for their children. 
For the mother labors more in child-bearing, and she knows more surely 
than the father who are her children."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, love should be more fond towards those who have labored 
for us more, according to Rm. 16:6: "Salute Mary, who hath labored much 
among you." Now the mother labors more than the father in giving birth 
and education to her child; wherefore it is written (Ecclus. 7:29): 
"Forget not the groanings of thy mother." Therefore a man ought to love 
his mother more than his father.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Jerome says on Ezech. 44:25 that "man ought to love God 
the Father of all, and then his own father," and mentions the mother 
afterwards.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[10] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In making such comparisons as this, we must take the 
answer in the strict sense, so that the present question is whether the 
father as father, ought to be loved more than the  mother as mother. The 
reason is that virtue and vice may make such a difference in such like 
matters, that friendship may be diminished or destroyed, as the 
Philosopher remarks (Ethic. viii, 7). Hence Ambrose [*Origen, Hom. ii in 
Cant.] says: "Good servants should be preferred to wicked children."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[10] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Strictly speaking, however, the father should be loved more than the 
mother. For father and mother are loved as principles of our natural 
origin. Now the father is principle in a more excellent way than the 
mother, because he is the active principle, while the mother is a passive 
and material principle. Consequently, strictly speaking, the father is to 
be loved more.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the begetting of man, the mother supplies the formless 
matter of the body; and the latter receives its form through the 
formative power that is in the semen of the father. And though this power 
cannot create the rational soul, yet it disposes the matter of the body 
to receive that form.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This applies to another kind of love. For the friendship 
between lover and lover differs specifically from the friendship between 
child and parent: while the friendship we are speaking of here, is that 
which a man owes his father and mother through being begotten of them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reply to the Third Objection is evident.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[11] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man ought to love his wife more than his 
father and mother. For no man leaves a thing for another unless he love 
the latter more. Now it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++2:24">Gn. 2:24</a>) that "a man shell leave 
father and mother" on account of his wife. Therefore a man ought to love 
his wife more than his father and mother.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[11] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++5:33">Eph. 5:33</a>) that a husband should "love 
his wife as himself." Now a man ought to love himself more than his 
parents. Therefore he ought to love his wife also more than his parents.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[11] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, love should be greater where there are more reasons for 
loving. Now there are more reasons for love in the friendship of a man 
towards his wife. For the Philosopher says (Ethic. viii, 12) that "in 
this friendship there are the motives of utility, pleasure, and also of 
virtue, if husband and wife are virtuous." Therefore a man's love for his 
wife ought to be greater than his love for his parents.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[11] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> According to Eph. 5:28, "men ought to love their wives 
as their own bodies." Now a man ought to love his body less than his 
neighbor, as stated above (<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>): and among his  neighbors he should love 
his parents most. Therefore he ought to love his parents more than his 
wife.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[11] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>), the degrees of love may be taken 
from the good (which is loved), or from the union between those who love. 
On the part of the good which is the object loved, a man should love his 
parents more than his wife, because he loves them as his principles and 
considered as a more exalted good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[11] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But on the part of the union, the wife ought to be loved more, because 
she is united with her husband, as one flesh, according to Mt. 19:6: 
"Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh." Consequently a man loves 
his wife more intensely, but his parents with greater reverence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[11] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A man does not in all respects leave his father and mother 
for the sake of his wife: for in certain cases a man ought to succor his 
parents rather than his wife. He does however leave all his kinsfolk, and 
cleaves to his wife as regards the union of carnal connection and 
co-habitation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[11] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The words of the Apostle do not mean that a man ought to 
love his wife equally with himself, but that a man's love for himself is 
the reason for his love of his wife, since she is one with him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[11] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There are also several reasons for a man's love for his 
father; and these, in a certain respect, namely, as regards good, are 
more weighty than those for which a man loves his wife; although the 
latter outweigh the former as regards the closeness of the union.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[11] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the argument in the contrary sense, it must be observed that in 
the words quoted, the particle "as" denotes not equality of love but the 
motive of love. For the principal reason why a man loves his wife is her 
being united to him in the flesh.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[12] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man ought to love his benefactor more than 
one he has benefited. For Augustine says (De Catech. Rud. iv): "Nothing 
will incite another more to love you than that you love him first: for he 
must have a hard heart indeed, who not only refuses to love, but declines 
to return love already given." Now a man's benefactor forestalls him in 
the kindly deeds of charity. Therefore we ought to love our benefactors 
above all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[12] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the more grievously we sin by ceasing to love a man or 
by working against him, the more ought we to love him. Now it is a more 
grievous sin to cease loving a benefactor or to work against him, than to 
cease loving one to whom one has hitherto done kindly actions. Therefore 
we ought to love our benefactors more  than those to whom we are kind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[12] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, of all things lovable, God is to be loved most, and then 
one's father, as Jerome says [*Comment. in Ezechiel xliv, 25]. Now these 
are our greatest benefactors. Therefore a benefactor should be loved 
above all others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[12] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. ix, 7), that "benefactors 
seem to love recipients of their benefactions, rather than vice versa."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[12] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26ATHEP1">Articles [9]</a>,11), a thing is loved more in two 
ways: first because it has the character of a more excellent good, 
secondly by reason of a closer connection. In the first way we ought to 
love our benefactor most, because, since he is a principle of good to the 
man he has benefited, he has the character of a more excellent good, as 
stated above with regard to one's father (<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[12] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second way, however, we love those more who have received 
benefactions from us, as the Philosopher proves (Ethic. ix, 7) by four 
arguments. First because the recipient of benefactions is the handiwork 
of the benefactor, so that we are wont to say of a man: "He was made by 
so and so." Now it is natural to a man to love his own work (thus it is 
to be observed that poets love their own poems): and the reason is that 
we love "to be" and "to live," and these are made manifest in our 
"action." Secondly, because we all naturally love that in which we see 
our own good. Now it is true that the benefactor has some good of his in 
the recipient of his benefaction, and the recipient some good in the 
benefactor; but the benefactor sees his virtuous good in the recipient, 
while the recipient sees his useful good in the benefactor. Now it gives 
more pleasure to see one's virtuous good than one's useful good, both 
because it is more enduring for usefulness quickly flits by, and the 
pleasure of calling a thing to mind is not like the pleasure of having it 
present and because it is more pleasant to recall virtuous goods than the 
profit we have derived from others. Thirdly, because is it the lover's 
part to act, since he wills and works the good of the beloved, while the 
beloved takes a passive part in receiving good, so that to love surpasses 
being loved, for which reason the greater love is on the part of the 
benefactor. Fourthly because it is more difficult to give than to receive 
favors: and we are most fond of things which have cost us most trouble, 
while we almost despise what comes easy to us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[12] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is some thing in the benefactor that incites the 
recipient to love him: whereas the benefactor loves the recipient, not 
through being incited by him, but through being moved thereto of his own 
accord: and what we do of our own accord surpasses what we do through 
another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[12] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The love of the beneficiary for the benefactor is more of a 
duty, wherefore the contrary is the greater sin. On the  other hand, the 
love of the benefactor for the beneficiary is more spontaneous, wherefore 
it is quicker to act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[12] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God also loves us more than we love Him, and parents love 
their children more than these love them. Yet it does not follow that we 
love all who have received good from us, more than any of our 
benefactors. For we prefer such benefactors as God and our parents, from 
whom we have received the greatest favors, to those on whom we have 
bestowed lesser benefits.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[13] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the order of charity does not endure in 
heaven. For Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xlviii): "Perfect charity 
consists in loving greater goods more, and lesser goods less." Now 
charity will be perfect in heaven. Therefore a man will love those who 
are better more than either himself or those who are connected with him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[13] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we love more him to whom we wish a greater good. Now 
each one in heaven wishes a greater good for those who have more good, 
else his will would not be conformed in all things to God's will: and 
there to be better is to have more good. Therefore in heaven each one 
loves more those who are better, and consequently he loves others more 
than himself, and one who is not connected with him, more than one who is.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[13] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in heaven love will be entirely for God's sake, for then 
will be fulfilled the words of 1 Cor. 15:28: "That God may be all in 
all." Therefore he who is nearer God will be loved more, so that a man 
will love a better man more than himself, and one who is not connected 
with him, more than one who is.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Nature is not done away, but perfected, by glory. Now 
the order of charity given above (<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3,4) is derived from nature: 
since all things naturally love themselves more than others. Therefore 
this order of charity will endure in heaven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[13] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The order of charity must needs remain in heaven, as 
regards the love of God above all things. For this will be realized 
simply when man shall enjoy God perfectly. But, as regards the order 
between man himself and other men, a distinction would seem to be 
necessary, because, as we stated above (<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26ATHEP1">Articles [7]</a>,9), the degrees of love may 
be distinguished either in respect of the good which a man desires for 
another, or according to the intensity of love itself. In the first way a 
man will love better men more than himself, and those who are less good, 
less than himself: because, by reason of the perfect conformity of the 
human to the Divine will, each of the blessed will desire everyone to 
have what is due to him according to Divine justice. Nor will that be a 
time for advancing by means of merit to a yet greater reward, as happens 
now while it is possible for a man to desire both the virtue and the 
reward of a better man, whereas then the will of each one will  rest 
within the limits determined by God. But in the second way a man will 
love himself more than even his better neighbors, because the intensity 
of the act of love arises on the part of the person who loves, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26ATHEP1">Articles [7]</a>,9). Moreover it is for this that the gift of charity is 
bestowed by God on each one, namely, that he may first of all direct his 
mind to God, and this pertains to a man's love for himself, and that, in 
the second place, he may wish other things to be directed to God, and 
even work for that end according to his capacity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[13] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the order to be observed among our neighbors, a man will simply 
love those who are better, according to the love of charity. Because the 
entire life of the blessed consists in directing their minds to God, 
wherefore the entire ordering of their love will be ruled with respect to 
God, so that each one will love more and reckon to be nearer to himself 
those who are nearer to God. For then one man will no longer succor 
another, as he needs to in the present life, wherein each man has to 
succor those who are closely connected with him rather than those who are 
not, no matter what be the nature of their distress: hence it is that in 
this life, a man, by the inclination of charity, loves more those who are 
more closely united to him, for he is under a greater obligation to 
bestow on them the effect of charity. It will however be possible in 
heaven for a man to love in several ways one who is connected with him, 
since the causes of virtuous love will not be banished from the mind of 
the blessed. Yet all these reasons are incomparably surpassed by that 
which is taken from nighness to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[13] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument should be granted as to those who are 
connected together; but as regards man himself, he ought to love himself 
so much the more than others, as his charity is more perfect, since 
perfect entire reason of his love, for God is man's charity directs man 
to God perfectly, and this belongs to love of oneself, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[13] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument considers the order of charity in respect of 
the degree of good one wills the person one loves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[26] A[13] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God will be to each one the entire reason of his love, for 
God is man's entire good. For if we make the impossible supposition that 
God were not man's good, He would not be man's reason for loving. Hence 
it is that in the order of love man should love himself more than all 
else after God.<br>
