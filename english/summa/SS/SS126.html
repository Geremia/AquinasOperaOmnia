<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the vice of fearlessness: under which head there 
are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS126.html#SSQ126A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is a sin to be fearless?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS126.html#SSQ126A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is opposed to fortitude?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that fearlessness is not a sin. For that which is 
reckoned to the praise of a just man is not a sin. Now it is written in 
praise of the just man (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++28:1">Prov. 28:1</a>): "The just, bold as a lion, shall be 
without dread." Therefore it is not a sin to be without fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing is so fearful as death, according to the 
Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 6). Yet one ought not to fear even death, 
according to Mt. 10:28, "Fear ye not them that kill the body," etc., nor 
anything that can be inflicted by man, according to Is. 51:12, "Who art 
thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a mortal man?" Therefore it is not 
a sin to be fearless.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fear is born of love, as stated above (<A Href="SS125.html#SSQ125OUTP1">Question [125]</a>, <A Href="SS125.html#SSQ125A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). 
Now it belongs to the perfection of virtue to love nothing earthly, since 
according to Augustine (De Civ. Dei xiv), "the love of God to the 
abasement of self makes us citizens of the heavenly city." Therefore it 
is seemingly not a sin to fear nothing earthly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said of the unjust judge (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++18:2">Lk. 18:2</a>) that "he 
feared not God nor regarded man."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since fear is born of love, we must seemingly judge alike 
of love and fear. Now it is here a question of that fear whereby one 
dreads temporal evils, and which results from the love of temporal goods. 
And every man has it instilled in him by nature to love his own life and 
whatever is directed thereto; and to do so in due measure, that is, to 
love these things not as placing his end therein, but as things to be 
used for the sake of his last end. Hence it is contrary to the natural 
inclination, and therefore a sin, to fall short of loving them in due 
measure. Nevertheless, one never lapses entirely from this love: since 
what is natural cannot be wholly lost: for which reason the Apostle says 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eph++5:29">Eph. 5:29</a>): "No man ever hated his own flesh." Wherefore even those that 
slay themselves do so from love of their own flesh, which they desire to 
free from present stress. Hence it may happen that a man fears death and 
other temporal evils less than he ought,  for the reason that he loves 
them* less than he ought. [*Viz. the contrary goods. One would expect 
'se' instead of 'ea.' We should then read: For the reason that he loves 
himself less than he ought.] But that he fear none of these things cannot 
result from an entire lack of love, but only from the fact that he thinks 
it impossible for him to be afflicted by the evils contrary to the goods 
he loves. This is sometimes the result of pride of soul presuming on self 
and despising others, according to the saying of Job 41:24,25: "He 
[Vulg.: 'who'] was made to fear no one, he beholdeth every high thing": 
and sometimes it happens through a defect in the reason; thus the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 7) that the "Celts, through lack of 
intelligence, fear nothing." [*"A man would deserve to be called insane 
and senseless if there were nothing that he feared, not even an 
earthquake nor a storm at sea, as is said to be the case with the 
Celts."] It is therefore evident that fearlessness is a vice, whether it 
result from lack of love, pride of soul, or dullness of understanding: 
yet the latter is excused from sin if it be invincible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The just man is praised for being without fear that 
withdraws him from good; not that he is altogether fearless, for it is 
written (Ecclus. 1:28): "He that is without fear cannot be justified."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Death and whatever else can be inflicted by mortal man are 
not to be feared so that they make us forsake justice: but they are to be 
feared as hindering man in acts of virtue, either as regards himself, or 
as regards the progress he may cause in others. Hence it is written 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++14:16">Prov. 14:16</a>): "A wise man feareth and declineth from evil."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Temporal goods are to be despised as hindering us from 
loving and serving God, and on the same score they are not to be feared; 
wherefore it is written (Ecclus. 34:16): "He that feareth the Lord shall 
tremble at nothing." But temporal goods are not to be despised, in so far 
as they are helping us instrumentally to attain those things that pertain 
to Divine fear and love.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether fearlessness is opposed to fortitude?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that fearlessness is not opposed to fortitude. For we 
judge of habits by their acts. Now no act of fortitude is hindered by a 
man being fearless: since if fear be removed, one is both brave to 
endure, and daring to attack. Therefore fearlessness is not opposed to 
fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, fearlessness is a vice, either through lack of due love, 
or on account of pride, or by reason of folly. Now lack of due love is 
opposed to charity, pride is contrary to humility, and folly to prudence 
or wisdom. Therefore the vice of fearlessness is not opposed to fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, vices are opposed to virtue and extremes to  the mean. 
But one mean has only one extreme on the one side. Since then fortitude 
has fear opposed to it on the one side and daring on the other, it seems 
that fearlessness is not opposed thereto.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher (Ethic. iii) reckons fearlessness to be 
opposed to fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), fortitude is concerned 
about fear and daring. Now every moral virtue observes the rational mean 
in the matter about which it is concerned. Hence it belongs to fortitude 
that man should moderate his fear according to reason, namely that he 
should fear what he ought, and when he ought, and so forth. Now this mode 
of reason may be corrupted either by excess or by deficiency. Wherefore 
just as timidity is opposed to fortitude by excess of fear, in so far as 
a man fears what he ought not, and as he ought not, so too fearlessness 
is opposed thereto by deficiency of fear, in so far as a man fears not 
what he ought to fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The act of fortitude is to endure death without fear, and 
to be aggressive, not anyhow, but according to reason: this the fearless 
man does not do.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Fearlessness by its specific nature corrupts the mean of 
fortitude, wherefore it is opposed to fortitude directly. But in respect 
of its causes nothing hinders it from being opposed to other virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[126] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The vice of daring is opposed to fortitude by excess of 
daring, and fearlessness by deficiency of fear. Fortitude imposes the 
mean on each passion. Hence there is nothing unreasonable in its having 
different extremes in different respects.<br>
