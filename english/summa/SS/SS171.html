    <br />
    PERTAINING TO KNOWLEDGE (Questions [171]-175)<br />
    <br />
    OF PROPHECY (SIX ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    After treating individually of all the virtues and vices that pertain to men
    of all conditions and estates, we must now consider those things which
    pertain especially to certain men. Now there is a triple difference between
    men as regards things connected with the soul's habits and acts. First, in
    reference to the various gratuitous graces, according to 1 Cor. 12:4,7:
    "There are diversities of graces... and to one... by the Spirit is given the
    word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge," etc. Another difference
    arises from the diversities of life, namely the active and the contemplative
    life, which correspond to diverse purposes of operation, wherefore it is
    stated (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++12%3A4,7"
      >1 Cor. 12:4,7</a
    >) that "there are diversities of operations." For the purpose of operation
    in Martha, who "was busy about much serving," which pertains to the active
    life, differed from the purpose of operation in Mary, "who sitting... at the
    Lord's feet, heard His word" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++10%3A39,40"
      >Lk. 10:39,40</a
    >), which pertains to the contemplative life. A third difference corresponds
    to the various duties and states of life, as expressed in Eph. 4:11, "And He
    gave some apostles; and some prophets; and other some evangelists; and other
    some pastors and doctors": and this pertains to diversity of ministries, of
    which it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++12%3A5"
      >1 Cor. 12:5</a
    >): "There are diversities of ministries."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    With regard to gratuitous graces, which are the first object to be
    considered, it must be observed that some of them pertain to knowledge, some
    to speech, and some to operation. Now all things pertaining to knowledge may
    be comprised under "prophecy," since prophetic revelation extends not only
    to future events relating to man, but also to things relating to God, both
    as to those which are to be believed by all and are matters of "faith," and
    as to yet higher mysteries, which concern the perfect and belong to
    "wisdom." Again, prophetic revelation is about things pertaining to
    spiritual substances, by whom we are urged to good or evil; this pertains to
    the "discernment of spirits." Moreover it extends to the direction of human
    acts, and this pertains to "knowledge," as we shall explain further on
    (Question [177]). Accordingly we must first of all consider prophecy, and
    rapture which is a degree of prophecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Prophecy admits of four heads of consideration: (1) its essence; (2) its
    cause; (3) the mode of prophetic knowledge; (4) the division of prophecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are six points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS171.html#SSQ171A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether prophecy pertains to
    knowledge?
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS171.html#SSQ171A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a habit?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS171.html#SSQ171A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is only about future
    contingencies?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS171.html#SSQ171A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether a prophet knows all
    possible matters of prophecy?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS171.html#SSQ171A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether a prophet distinguishes
    that which he perceives by the gift of God, from that which he perceives by
    his own spirit?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS171.html#SSQ171A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether anything false can be the
    matter of prophecy?

  <h3 align="left">Whether prophecy pertains to knowledge?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prophecy does not pertain to
    knowledge. For it is written (Ecclus. 48:14) that after death the body of
    Eliseus prophesied, and further on (Ecclus. 49:18) it is said of Joseph that
    "his bones were visited, and after death they prophesied." Now no knowledge
    remains in the body or in the bones after death. Therefore prophecy does not
    pertain to knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++14%3A3"
      >1 Cor. 14:3</a
    >): "He that prophesieth, speaketh to men unto edification." Now speech is
    not knowledge itself, but its effect. Therefore it would seem that prophecy
    does not pertain to knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every cognitive perfection excludes
    folly and madness. Yet both of these are consistent with prophecy; for it is
    written (Osee 9:7): "Know ye, O Israel, that the prophet was foolish and mad
    [*Vulg.: 'the spiritual man was mad']." Therefore prophecy is not a
    cognitive perfection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, just as revelation regards the
    intellect, so inspiration regards, apparently, the affections, since it
    denotes a kind of motion. Now prophecy is described as "inspiration" or
    "revelation," according to Cassiodorus [*Prolog. super Psalt. i]. Therefore
    it would seem that prophecy does not pertain to the intellect more than to
    the affections.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Sam++9%3A9"
      >1 Kgs. 9:9</a
    >): "For he that is now called a prophet, in time past was called a seer."
    Now sight pertains to knowledge. Therefore prophecy pertains to
    knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Prophecy first and chiefly consists in
    knowledge, because, to wit, prophets know things that are far [procul]
    removed from man's knowledge. Wherefore they may be said to take their name
    from {phanos}, "apparition," because things appear to them from afar.
    Wherefore, as Isidore states (Etym. vii, 8), "in the Old Testament, they
    were called Seers, because they saw what others saw not, and surveyed things
    hidden in mystery." Hence among heathen nations they were known as "vates,
    on account of their power of mind [vi mentis]," [*The Latin 'vates' is from
    the Greek {phates}, and may be rendered 'soothsayer'] (Etym. viii, 7).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Since, however, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++12%3A7"
      >1 Cor. 12:7</a
    >): "The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit," and
    further on (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++14%3A12"
      >1 Cor. 14:12</a
    >): "Seek to abound unto the edification of the Church," it follows that
    prophecy consists secondarily in speech, in so far as the prophets declare
    for the instruction of others, the things they know through being taught of
    God, according to the saying of Is. 21:10, "That which I have heard of the
    Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared unto you." Accordingly, as
    Isidore says (Etym. viii, 7), "prophets" may be described as "proefatores
    [foretellers], because they tell from afar [porro fantur]," that is, speak
    from a distance, "and foretell the truth about things to come."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now those things above human ken which are revealed by God cannot be
    confirmed by human reason, which they surpass as regards the operation of
    the Divine power, according to Mk. 16:20, "They... preached everywhere, the
    Lord working withal and confirming the word with signs that followed."
    Hence, thirdly, prophecy is concerned with the working of miracles, as a
    kind of confirmation of the prophetic utterances. Wherefore it is written
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++34%3A10,11"
      >Dt. 34:10,11</a
    >): "There arose no more a prophet in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord
    knew face to face, in all the signs and wonders."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These passages speak of prophecy in
    reference to the third point just mentioned, which regards the proof of
    prophecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Apostle is speaking there of the
    prophetic utterances.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those prophets who are described as
    foolish and mad are not true but false prophets, of whom it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++3%3A16"
      >Jer. 3:16</a
    >): "Hearken not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you, and
    deceive you; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the
    mouth of the Lord," and (Ezech. 13:3): "Woe to the foolish prophets, that
    follow their own spirit, and see nothing."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> It is requisite to prophecy that the
    intention of the mind be raised to the perception of Divine things:
    wherefore it is written (Ezech. 2:1): "Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and
    I will speak to thee." This raising of the intention is brought about by the
    motion of the Holy Ghost, wherefore the text goes on to say: "And the Spirit
    entered into me... and He set me upon my feet." After the mind's intention
    has been raised to heavenly things, it perceives the things of God; hence
    the text continues: "And I heard Him speaking to me." Accordingly
    inspiration is requisite for prophecy, as regards the raising of the mind,
    according to Job 32:8, "The inspiration of the Almighty giveth
    understanding": while revelation is necessary, as regards the very
    perception of Divine things, whereby prophecy is completed; by its means the
    veil of darkness and ignorance is removed, according to Job 12:22, "He
    discovereth great things out of darkness."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether prophecy is a habit?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prophecy is a habit. For
    according to Ethic. ii, 5, "there are three things in the soul, power,
    passion, and habit." Now prophecy is not a power, for then it would be in
    all men, since the powers of the soul are common to them. Again it is not a
    passion, since the passions belong to the appetitive faculty, as stated
    above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS022.html#FSQ22OUTP1">Question [22]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS022.html#FSQ22A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); whereas prophecy
    pertains principally to knowledge, as stated in the foregoing Article.
    Therefore prophecy is a habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every perfection of the soul, which is
    not always in act, is a habit. Now prophecy is a perfection of the soul; and
    it is not always in act, else a prophet could not be described as asleep.
    Therefore seemingly prophecy is a habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, prophecy is reckoned among the
    gratuitous graces. Now grace is something in the soul, after the manner of a
    habit, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS110.html#FSQ110OUTP1">Question [110]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS110.html#FSQ110A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore
    prophecy is a habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A habit is something "whereby we act when we
    will," as the Commentator [*Averroes or Ibn Roshd, 1120-1198] says (De Anima
    iii). But a man cannot make use of prophecy when he will, as appears in the
    case of Eliseus (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Kgs++3%3A15"
      >4 Kgs. 3:15</a
    >), "who on Josaphat inquiring of him concerning the future, and the spirit
    of prophecy failing him, caused a minstrel to be brought to him, that the
    spirit of prophecy might come down upon him through the praise of psalmody,
    and fill his mind with things to come," as Gregory observes (Hom. i super
    Ezech.). Therefore prophecy is not a habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A13"
      >Eph. 5:13</a
    >), "all that is made manifest is light," because, to wit, just as the
    manifestation of the material sight takes place through material light, so
    too the manifestation of intellectual sight takes place through intellectual
    light. Accordingly manifestation must be proportionate to the light by means
    of which it takes place, even as an effect is proportionate to its cause.
    Since then prophecy pertains to a knowledge that surpasses natural reason,
    as stated above (<a href="SS171.html#SSQ171A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it
    follows that prophecy requires an intellectual light surpassing the light of
    natural reason. Hence the saying of Micah 7:8: "When I sit in darkness, the
    Lord is my light." Now light may be in a subject in two ways: first, by way
    of an abiding form, as material light is in the sun, and in fire; secondly,
    by way of a passion, or passing impression, as light is in the air. Now the
    prophetic light is not in the prophet's intellect by way of an abiding form,
    else a prophet would always be able to prophesy, which is clearly false. For
    Gregory says (Hom. i super Ezech.): "Sometimes the spirit of prophecy is
    lacking to the prophet, nor is it always within the call of his mind, yet so
    that in its absence he knows that its presence is due to a gift." Hence
    Eliseus said of the Sunamite woman (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Kgs++4%3A27"
      >4 Kgs. 4:27</a
    >): "Her soul is in anguish, and the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not
    told me." The reason for this is that the intellectual light that is in a
    subject by way of an abiding and complete form, perfects the intellect
    chiefly to the effect of knowing the principle of the things manifested by
    that light; thus by the light of the active intellect the intellect knows
    chiefly the first principles of all things known naturally. Now the
    principle of things pertaining to supernatural knowledge, which are
    manifested by prophecy, is God Himself, Whom the prophets do not see in His
    essence, although He is seen by the blessed in heaven, in whom this light is
    by way of an abiding and complete form, according to Ps. 35:10, "In Thy
    light we shall see light."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It follows therefore that the prophetic light is in the prophet's soul by
    way of a passion or transitory impression. This is indicated Ex. 33:22:
    "When my glory shall pass, I will set thee in a hole of the rock," etc., and
    3 Kgs. 19:11: "Go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord; and behold
    the Lord passeth," etc. Hence it is that even as the air is ever in need of
    a fresh enlightening, so too the prophet's mind is always in need of a fresh
    revelation; thus a disciple who has not yet acquired the principles of an
    art needs to have every detail explained to him. Wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++1%3A4"
      >Is. 1:4</a
    >): "In the morning He wakeneth my ear, so that I may hear Him as a master."
    This is also indicated by the very manner in which prophecies are uttered:
    thus it is stated that "the Lord spake to such and such a prophet," or that
    "the word of the Lord," or "the hand of the Lord was made upon him."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But a habit is an abiding form. Wherefore it is evident that, properly
    speaking, prophecy is not a habit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This division of the Philosopher's does
    not comprise absolutely all that is in the soul, but only such as can be
    principles of moral actions, which are done sometimes from passion,
    sometimes from habit, sometimes from mere power, as in the case of those who
    perform an action from the judgment of their reason before having the habit
    of that action.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    However, prophecy may be reduced to a passion, provided we understand
    passion to denote any kind of receiving, in which sense the Philosopher says
    (De Anima iii, 4) that "to understand is, in a way, to be passive." For just
    as, in natural knowledge, the possible intellect is passive to the light of
    the active intellect, so too in prophetic knowledge the human intellect is
    passive to the enlightening of the Divine light.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as in corporeal things, when a
    passion ceases, there remains a certain aptitude to a repetition of the
    passion---thus wood once ignited is more easily ignited again, so too in the
    prophet's intellect, after the actual enlightenment has ceased, there
    remains an aptitude to be enlightened anew---thus when the mind has once
    been aroused to devotion, it is more easily recalled to its former devotion.
    Hence Augustine says (De orando Deum. Ep. cxxx, 9) that our prayers need to
    be frequent, "lest devotion be extinguished as soon as it is kindled."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We might, however, reply that a person is called a prophet, even while his
    prophetic enlightenment ceases to be actual, on account of his being deputed
    by God, according to Jer. 1:5, "And I made thee a prophet unto the
    nations."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Every gift of grace raises man to
    something above human nature, and this may happen in two ways. First, as to
    the substance of the act---for instance, the working of miracles, and the
    knowledge of the uncertain and hidden things of Divine wisdom---and for such
    acts man is not granted a habitual gift of grace. Secondly, a thing is above
    human nature as to the mode but not the substance of the act---for instance
    to love God and to know Him in the mirror of His creatures---and for this a
    habitual gift of grace is bestowed.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether prophecy is only about future contingencies?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prophecy is only about future
    contingencies. For Cassiodorus says [*Prol. super Psalt. i] that "prophecy
    is a Divine inspiration or revelation, announcing the issue of things with
    unchangeable truth." Now issues pertain to future contingencies. Therefore
    the prophetic revelation is about future contingencies alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to 1 Cor. 12, the grace of
    prophecy is differentiated from wisdom and faith, which are about Divine
    things; and from the discernment of spirits, which is about created spirits;
    and from knowledge, which is about human things. Now habits and acts are
    differentiated by their objects, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54OUTP1">Question [54]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore it seems
    that the object of prophecy is not connected with any of the above.
    Therefore it follows that it is about future contingencies alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, difference of object causes difference
    of species, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54OUTP1">Question [54]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore, if one
    prophecy is about future contingencies, and another about other things, it
    would seem to follow that these are different species of prophecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Hom. i super Ezech.) that some
    prophecies are "about the future, for instance (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++7%3A14"
      >Is. 7:14</a
    >), 'Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son'"; some are "about the
    past, as (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A1"
      >Gn. 1:1</a
    >), 'In the beginning God created heaven and earth'"; some are "about the
    present," as (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++14%3A24,25"
      >1 Cor. 14:24,25</a
    >), "If all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not... the
    secrets of his heart are made manifest." Therefore prophecy is not about
    future contingencies alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A manifestation made by means of a certain
    light can extend to all those things that are subject to that light: thus
    the body's sight extends to all colors, and the soul's natural knowledge
    extends to whatever is subject to the light of the active intellect. Now
    prophetic knowledge comes through a Divine light, whereby it is possible to
    know all things both Divine and human, both spiritual and corporeal; and
    consequently the prophetic revelation extends to them all. Thus by the
    ministry of spirits a prophetic revelation concerning the perfections of God
    and the angels was made to Is. 6:1, where it is written, "I saw the Lord
    sitting upon a throne high and elevated." Moreover his prophecy contains
    matters referring to natural bodies, according to the words of Is. 40:12,
    "Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of His hand," etc. It also
    contains matters relating to human conduct, according to Is. 58:1, "Deal thy
    bread to the hungry," etc.; and besides this it contains things pertaining
    to future events, according to Is. 47:9, "Two things shall come upon thee
    suddenly in one day, barrenness and widowhood."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Since, however, prophecy is about things remote from our knowledge, it must
    be observed that the more remote things are from our knowledge the more
    pertinent they are to prophecy. Of such things there are three degrees. One
    degree comprises things remote from the knowledge, either sensitive or
    intellective, of some particular man, but not from the knowledge of all men;
    thus a particular man knows by sense things present to him locally, which
    another man does not know by human sense, since they are removed from him.
    Thus Eliseus knew prophetically what his disciple Giezi had done in his
    absence (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Kgs++5%3A26"
      >4 Kgs. 5:26</a
    >), and in like manner the secret thoughts of one man are manifested
    prophetically to another, according to 1 Cor. 14:25; and again in this way
    what one man knows by demonstration may be revealed to another
    prophetically.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The second degree comprises those things which surpass the knowledge of all
    men without exception, not that they are in themselves unknowable, but on
    account of a defect in human knowledge; such as the mystery of the Trinity,
    which was revealed by the Seraphim saying: "Holy, Holy, Holy," etc. (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++6%3A3"
      >Is. 6:3</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The last degree comprises things remote from the knowledge of all men,
    through being in themselves unknowable; such are future contingencies, the
    truth of which is indeterminate. And since that which is predicated
    universally and by its very nature, takes precedence of that which is
    predicated in a limited and relative sense, it follows that revelation of
    future events belongs most properly to prophecy, and from this prophecy
    apparently takes its name. Hence Gregory says (Hom. i super Ezech.): "And
    since a prophet is so called because he foretells the future, his name loses
    its significance when he speaks of the past or present."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Prophecy is there defined according to
    its proper signification; and it is in this sense that it is differentiated
    from the other gratuitous graces.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This is evident from what has just been
    said. We might also reply that all those things that are the matter of
    prophecy have the common aspect of being unknowable to man except by Divine
    revelation; whereas those that are the matter of "wisdom," "knowledge," and
    the "interpretation of speeches," can be known by man through natural
    reason, but are manifested in a higher way through the enlightening of the
    Divine light. As to "faith," although it is about things invisible to man,
    it is not concerned with the knowledge of the things believed, but with a
    man's certitude of assent to things known by others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The formal element in prophetic
    knowledge is the Divine light, which being one, gives unity of species to
    prophecy, although the things prophetically manifested by the Divine light
    are diverse.<br />

    Whether by the Divine revelation a prophet knows all that can be known
    prophetically?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that by the Divine revelation a
    prophet knows all that can be known prophetically. For it is written (Amos
    3:7): "The Lord God doth nothing without revealing His secret to His
    servants the prophets." Now whatever is revealed prophetically is something
    done by God. Therefore there is not one of them but what is revealed to the
    prophet.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "God's works are perfect" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++32%3A4"
      >Dt. 32:4</a
    >). Now prophecy is a "Divine revelation," as stated above (<a
      href="SS171.html#SSQ171A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >). Therefore it is perfect; and this would not be so unless all possible
    matters of prophecy were revealed prophetically, since "the perfect is that
    which lacks nothing" (Phys. iii, 6). Therefore all possible matters of
    prophecy are revealed to the prophet.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Divine light which causes prophecy
    is more powerful than the right of natural reason which is the cause of
    human science. Now a man who has acquired a science knows whatever pertains
    to that science; thus a grammarian knows all matters of grammar. Therefore
    it would seem that a prophet knows all matters of prophecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Hom. i super Ezech.) that
    "sometimes the spirit of prophecy indicates the present to the prophet's
    mind and nowise the future; and sometimes it points not to the present but
    to the future." Therefore the prophet does not know all matters of
    prophecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Things which differ from one another need not
    exist simultaneously, save by reason of some one thing in which they are
    connected and on which they depend: thus it has been stated above (FS,
    Question [65], Articles [1],2) that all the virtues must needs exist
    simultaneously on account of prudence and charity. Now all the things that
    are known through some principle are connected in that principle and depend
    thereon. Hence he who knows a principle perfectly, as regards all to which
    its virtue extends, knows at the same time all that can be known through
    that principle; whereas if the common principle is unknown, or known only in
    a general way, it does not follow that one knows all those things at the
    same time, but each of them has to be manifested by itself, so that
    consequently some of them may be known, and some not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the principle of those things that are prophetically manifested by the
    Divine light is the first truth, which the prophets do not see in itself.
    Wherefore there is no need for their knowing all possible matters of
    prophecy; but each one knows some of them according to the special
    revelation of this or that matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Lord reveals to the prophets all
    things that are necessary for the instruction of the faithful; yet not all
    to every one, but some to one, and some to another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Prophecy is by way of being something
    imperfect in the genus of Divine revelation: hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++13%3A8"
      >1 Cor. 13:8</a
    >) that "prophecies shall be made void," and that "we prophesy in part,"
    i.e. imperfectly. The Divine revelation will be brought to its perfection in
    heaven; wherefore the same text continues (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++113%3A10"
      >1 Cor. 113:10</a
    >): "When that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done
    away." Consequently it does not follow that nothing is lacking to prophetic
    revelation, but that it lacks none of those things to which prophecy is
    directed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He who has a science knows the
    principles of that science, whence whatever is pertinent to that science
    depends; wherefore to have the habit of a science perfectly, is to know
    whatever is pertinent to that science. But God Who is the principle of
    prophetic knowledge is not known in Himself through prophecy; wherefore the
    comparison fails.<br />

    Whether the prophet always distinguishes what he says by his own spirit from
    what he says by the prophetic spirit?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the prophet always
    distinguishes what he says by his own spirit from what he says by the
    prophetic spirit. For Augustine states (Confess. vi, 13) that his mother
    said "she could, through a certain feeling, which in words she could not
    express, discern betwixt Divine revelations, and the dreams of her own
    soul." Now prophecy is a Divine revelation, as stated above (<a
      href="SS171.html#SSQ171A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >). Therefore the prophet always distinguishes what he says by the spirit of
    prophecy, from what he says by his own spirit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God commands nothing impossible, as
    Jerome [*Pelagius. Ep. xvi, among the supposititious works of St. Jerome]
    says. Now the prophets were commanded (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++23%3A28"
      >Jer. 23:28</a
    >): "The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath
    My word, let him speak My word with truth." Therefore the prophet can
    distinguish what he has through the spirit of prophecy from what he sees
    otherwise.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the certitude resulting from a Divine
    light is greater than that which results from the light of natural reason.
    Now he that has science, by the light of natural reason knows for certain
    that he has it. Therefore he that has prophecy by a Divine light is much
    more certain that he has it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Hom. i super Ezech.): "It must
    be observed that sometimes the holy prophets, when consulted, utter certain
    things by their own spirit, through being much accustomed to prophesying,
    and think they are speaking by the prophetic spirit."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The prophet's mind is instructed by God in two
    ways: in one way by an express revelation, in another way by a most
    mysterious instinct to "which the human mind is subjected without knowing
    it," as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 17). Accordingly the prophet has
    the greatest certitude about those things which he knows by an express
    revelation, and he has it for certain that they are revealed to him by God;
    wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++26%3A15"
      >Jer. 26:15</a
    >): "In truth the Lord sent me to you, to speak all these words in your
    hearing." Else, were he not certain about this, the faith which relies on
    the utterances of the prophet would not be certain. A sign of the prophet's
    certitude may be gathered from the fact that Abraham being admonished in a
    prophetic vision, prepared to sacrifice his only-begotten son, which he
    nowise would have done had he not been most certain of the Divine
    revelation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, his position with regard to the things he knows by
    instinct is sometimes such that he is unable to distinguish fully whether
    his thoughts are conceived of Divine instinct or of his own spirit. And
    those things which we know by Divine instinct are not all manifested with
    prophetic certitude, for this instinct is something imperfect in the genus
    of prophecy. It is thus that we are to understand the saying of Gregory.
    Lest, however, this should lead to error, "they are very soon set aright by
    the Holy Ghost [*For instance, cf. 2 Kgs. 7:3 seqq.], and from Him they hear
    the truth, so that they reproach themselves for having said what was
    untrue," as Gregory adds (Hom. i super Ezech.).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The arguments set down in the first place consider the revelation that is
    made by the prophetic spirit; wherefore the answer to all the objections is
    clear.<br />

    Whether things known or declared prophetically can be false?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that things known or declared
    prophetically can be false. For prophecy is about future contingencies, as
    stated above (<a href="SS171.html#SSQ171A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Now
    future contingencies may possibly not happen; else they would happen of
    necessity. Therefore the matter of prophecy can be false.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Isaias prophesied to Ezechias saying (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++38%3A1"
      >Is. 38:1</a
    >): "Take order with thy house, for thou shalt surely die, and shalt not
    live," and yet fifteen years were added to his life (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Kgs++20%3A6"
      >4 Kgs. 20:6</a
    >). Again the Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++18%3A7,8"
      >Jer. 18:7,8</a
    >): "I will suddenly speak against a nation and against a kingdom, to root
    out and to pull down and to destroy it. If that nation against which I have
    spoken shall repent of their evil, I also will repent of the evil that I
    have thought to do them." This is instanced in the example of the Ninevites,
    according to Jn. 3:10: "The Lord [Vulg.: 'God'] had mercy with regard to the
    evil which He had said that He would do to them, and He did it not."
    Therefore the matter of prophecy can be false.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in a conditional proposition, whenever
    the antecedent is absolutely necessary, the consequent is absolutely
    necessary, because the consequent of a conditional proposition stands in the
    same relation to the antecedent, as the conclusion to the premises in a
    syllogism, and a syllogism whose premises are necessary always leads to a
    necessary conclusion, as we find proved in I Poster. 6. But if the matter of
    a prophecy cannot be false, the following conditional proposition must needs
    be true: "If a thing has been prophesied, it will be." Now the antecedent of
    this conditional proposition is absolutely necessary, since it is about the
    past. Therefore the consequent is also necessary absolutely; yet this is
    unfitting, for then prophecy would not be about contingencies. Therefore it
    is untrue that the matter of prophecy cannot be false.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Cassiodorus says [*Prol. in Psalt. i] that
    "prophecy is a Divine inspiration or revelation, announcing the issue of
    things with invariable truth." Now the truth of prophecy would not be
    invariable, if its matter could be false. Therefore nothing false can come
    under prophecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As may be gathered from what has been said (<a
      href="SS171.html#SSQ171ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,3,5), prophecy is a kind of knowledge impressed under the form of teaching
    on the prophet's intellect, by Divine revelation. Now the truth of knowledge
    is the same in disciple and teacher since the knowledge of the disciple is a
    likeness of the knowledge of the teacher, even as in natural things the form
    of the thing generated is a likeness of the form of the generator. Jerome
    speaks in this sense when he says [*Comment. in Daniel ii, 10] that
    "prophecy is the seal of the Divine foreknowledge." Consequently the same
    truth must needs be in prophetic knowledge and utterances, as in the Divine
    knowledge, under which nothing false can possibly come, as stated in the FP,
    Question [16], Article [8]. Therefore nothing false can come under
    prophecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated in the FP, Question [14],
    Article [13] the certitude of the Divine foreknowledge does not exclude the
    contingency of future singular events, because that knowledge regards the
    future as present and already determinate to one thing. Wherefore prophecy
    also, which is an "impressed likeness" or "seal of the Divine
    foreknowledge," does not by its unchangeable truth exclude the contingency
    of future things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Divine foreknowledge regards future
    things in two ways. First, as they are in themselves, in so far, to wit, as
    it sees them in their presentiality: secondly, as in their causes, inasmuch
    as it sees the order of causes in relation to their effects. And though
    future contingencies, considered as in themselves, are determinate to one
    thing, yet, considered as in their causes, they are not so determined but
    that they can happen otherwise. Again, though this twofold knowledge is
    always united in the Divine intellect, it is not always united in the
    prophetic revelation, because an imprint made by an active cause is not
    always on a par with the virtue of that cause. Hence sometimes the prophetic
    revelation is an imprinted likeness of the Divine foreknowledge, in so far
    as the latter regards future contingencies in themselves: and such things
    happen in the same way as foretold, for example this saying of Is. 7:14:
    "Behold a virgin shall conceive." Sometimes, however, the prophetic
    revelation is an imprinted likeness of the Divine foreknowledge as knowing
    the order of causes to effects; and then at times the event is otherwise
    than foretold. Yet the prophecy does not cover a falsehood, for the meaning
    of the prophecy is that inferior causes, whether they be natural causes or
    human acts, are so disposed as to lead to such a result. In this way we are
    to understand the saying of Is. 38:1: "Thou shalt die, and not live"; in
    other words, "The disposition of thy body has a tendency to death": and the
    saying of Jonas 3:4, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be destroyed," that
    is to say, "Its merits demand that it should be destroyed." God is said "to
    repent," metaphorically, inasmuch as He bears Himself after the manner of
    one who repents, by "changing His sentence, although He changes not His
    counsel" [*Cf. FP, Question [19], Article [7], ad 2].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since the same truth of prophecy is the
    same as the truth of Divine foreknowledge, as stated above, the conditional
    proposition: "If this was prophesied, it will be," is true in the same way
    as the proposition: "If this was foreknown, it will be": for in both cases
    it is impossible for the antecedent not to be. Hence the consequent is
    necessary, considered, not as something future in our regard, but as being
    present to the Divine foreknowledge, as stated in the FP, Question [14],
    Article [13], ad 2.<br />
