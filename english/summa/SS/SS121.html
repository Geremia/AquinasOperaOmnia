<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the gift that corresponds to justice; namely, 
piety. Under this head there are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS121.html#SSQ121A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is a gift of the Holy Ghost?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS121.html#SSQ121A2THEP1">(2)</a> Which of the beatitudes and fruits corresponds to it?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that piety is not a gift. For the gifts differ from the 
virtues, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But piety is a virtue, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS101.html#SSQ101OUTP1">Question [101]</a>, <A Href="SS101.html#SSQ101A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore piety is not a gift.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the gifts are more excellent than the virtues,  above 
all the moral virtues, as above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). Now among the parts of 
justice religion is greater than piety. Therefore if any part of justice 
is to be accounted a gift, it seems that religion should be a gift rather 
than piety.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the gifts and their acts remain in heaven, as stated 
above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). But the act of piety cannot remain in heaven: 
for Gregory says (Moral. i) that "piety fills the inmost recesses of the 
heart with works of mercy": and so there will be no piety in heaven since 
there will be no unhappiness [*Cf. Question [30], Article [1]]. Therefore piety is not a 
gift.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is reckoned among the gifts in the eleventh chapter 
of Isaias (verse 2) [Douay: 'godliness'] [*"Pietas," whence our English 
word "pity," which is the same as mercy.]<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS068.html#FSQ68A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS069.html#FSQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS069.html#FSQ69ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3), 
the gifts of the Holy Ghost are habitual dispositions of the soul, 
rendering it amenable to the motion of the Holy Ghost. Now the Holy Ghost 
moves us to this effect among others, of having a filial affection 
towards God, according to Rm. 8:15, "You have received the spirit of 
adoption of sons, whereby we cry: Abba (Father)." And since it belongs 
properly to piety to pay duty and worship to one's father, it follows 
that piety, whereby, at the Holy Ghost's instigation, we pay worship and 
duty to God as our Father, is a gift of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The piety that pays duty and worship to a father in the 
flesh is a virtue: but the piety that is a gift pays this to God as 
Father.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To pay worship to God as Creator, as religion does, is more 
excellent than to pay worship to one's father in the flesh, as the piety 
that is a virtue does. But to pay worship to God as Father is yet more 
excellent than to pay worship to God as Creator and Lord. Wherefore 
religion is greater than the virtue of piety: while the gift of piety is 
greater than religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As by the virtue of piety man pays duty and worship not 
only to his father in the flesh, but also to all his kindred on account 
of their being related to his father so by the gift of piety he pays 
worship and duty not only to God, but also to all men on account of their 
relationship to God. Hence it belongs to piety to honor the saints, and 
not to contradict the Scriptures whether one understands them or not, as 
Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. ii). Consequently it also assists those 
who are in a state of unhappiness. And although this act has no place in 
heaven, especially after the Day of Judgment, yet piety will exercise its 
principal act, which is to revere God with filial affection: for it is 
then above all that this act will be fulfilled, according to Wis. 5:5, 
"Behold how they are numbered among the children of God." The saints will 
also mutually honor one another. Now, however, before the Judgment Day, 
the saints have pity on those also who are  living in this unhappy state.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the second beatitude, "Blessed are the meek," corresponds to the gift of piety?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the second beatitude, "Blessed are the meek," does 
not correspond to the gift of piety. For piety is the gift corresponding 
to justice, to which rather belongs the fourth beatitude, "Blessed are 
they that hunger and thirst after justice," or the fifth beatitude, 
"Blessed are the merciful," since as stated above (<A Href="SS121.html#SSQ121A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, Objection [3]), the 
works of mercy belong to piety. Therefore the second beatitude does not 
pertain to the gift of piety.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the gift of piety is directed by the gift of knowledge, 
which is united to it in the enumeration of the gifts (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++11">Is. 11</a>). Now 
direction and execution extend to the same matter. Since, then, the third 
beatitude, "Blessed are they that mourn," corresponds to the gift of 
knowledge, it seems that the second beatitude corresponds to piety.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the fruits correspond to the beatitudes and gifts, as 
stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS070.html#FSQ70OUTP1">Question [70]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS070.html#FSQ70A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now among the fruits, goodness and 
benignity seem to agree with piety rather than mildness, which pertains 
to meekness. Therefore the second beatitude does not correspond to the 
gift of piety.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i): "Piety is 
becoming to the meek."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In adapting the beatitudes to the gifts a twofold 
congruity may be observed. One is according to the order in which they 
are given, and Augustine seems to have followed this: wherefore he 
assigns the first beatitude to the lowest gift, namely, fear, and the 
second beatitude, "Blessed are the meek," to piety, and so on. Another 
congruity may be observed in keeping with the special nature of each gift 
and beatitude. In this way one must adapt the beatitudes to the gifts 
according to their objects and acts: and thus the fourth and fifth 
beatitudes would correspond to piety, rather than the second. Yet the 
second beatitude has a certain congruity with piety, inasmuch as meekness 
removes the obstacles to acts of piety.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Taking the beatitudes and gifts according to their proper 
natures, the same beatitude must needs correspond to knowledge and piety: 
but taking them according to their order, different beatitudes correspond 
to them, although a certain congruity may be observed, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[121] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the fruits goodness and benignity may be directly 
ascribed to piety; and mildness indirectly in so far as it removes 
obstacles to acts of piety, as stated above.
