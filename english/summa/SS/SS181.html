</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the acts of the moral virtues do not all 
pertain to the active life. For seemingly the active life regards only 
our relations with other persons: hence Gregory says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) 
that "the active life is to give bread to the hungry," and after 
mentioning many things that regard our relations with other people he 
adds finally, "and to give to each and every one whatever he needs." Now 
we are directed in our relations to others, not by all the acts of moral 
virtues, but only by those of justice and its parts, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,8; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3). Therefore the acts of the moral 
virtues do not all pertain to the active life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that Lia who was 
blear-eyed but fruitful signifies the active life: which "being occupied 
with work, sees less, and yet since it urges one's neighbor both by word 
and example to its imitation it begets a numerous offspring of good 
deeds." Now this would seem to belong to charity, whereby we love our 
neighbor, rather than to the moral virtues. Therefore seemingly the acts 
of moral virtue do not pertain to the active life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<A Href="SS180.html#SSQ180OUTP1">Question [180]</a>, <A Href="SS180.html#SSQ180A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the moral virtues 
dispose one to the contemplative life. Now disposition and perfection 
belong to the same thing. Therefore it would seem that the moral virtues 
do not pertain to the active life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says (De Summo Bono iii, 15): "In the active 
life all vices must first of all be extirpated by the practice of good 
works, in order that in the contemplative life the mind's eye being 
purified one may advance to the contemplation of the Divine light." Now 
all vices are not extirpated save by acts of the moral virtues. Therefore 
the acts of the moral virtues pertain to the active life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS179.html#SSQ179OUTP1">Question [179]</a>, <A Href="SS179.html#SSQ179A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) the active and the 
contemplative life differ according to the different occupations of men 
intent on different ends: one of which occupations is the consideration 
of the truth; and this is the end of the contemplative life, while the 
other is external work to which the active life is directed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is evident that the moral virtues are directed chiefly, not to 
the contemplation of truth but to operation. Wherefore the Philosopher 
says (Ethic. ii, 4) that "for virtue knowledge is of little or no avail." 
Hence it is clear that the moral virtues belong essentially to the active 
life; for which reason the Philosopher (Ethic. x, 8) subordinates the 
moral virtues to active happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The chief of the moral virtues is justice by which one man 
is directed in his relations towards another, as the  Philosopher proves 
(Ethic. v, 1). Hence the active life is described with reference to our 
relations with other people, because it consists in these things, not 
exclusively, but principally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is possible, by the acts of all the moral virtues, for 
one to direct one's neighbor to good by example: and this is what Gregory 
here ascribes to the active life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even as the virtue that is directed to the end of another 
virtue passes, as it were, into the species of the latter virtue, so 
again when a man makes use of things pertaining to the active life, 
merely as dispositions to contemplation, such things are comprised under 
the contemplative life. On the other hand, when we practice the works of 
the moral virtues, as being good in themselves, and not as dispositions 
to the contemplative life, the moral virtues belong to the active life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It may also be replied, however, that the active life is a disposition 
to the contemplative life.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether prudence pertains to the active life?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prudence does not pertain to the active life. 
For just as the contemplative life belongs to the cognitive power, so the 
active life belongs to the appetitive power. Now prudence belongs not to 
the appetitive but to the cognitive power. Therefore prudence does not 
belong to the active life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.) that the "active life 
being occupied with work, sees less," wherefore it is signified by Lia 
who was blear-eyed. But prudence requires clear eyes, so that one may 
judge aright of what has to be done. Therefore it seems that prudence 
does not pertain to the active life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, prudence stands between the moral and the intellectual 
virtues. Now just as the moral virtues belong to the active life, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS181.html#SSQ181A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), so do the intellectual virtues pertain to the 
contemplative life. Therefore it would seem that prudence pertains 
neither to the active nor to the contemplative life, but to an 
intermediate kind of life, of which Augustine makes mention (De Civ. Dei 
xix, 2,3,19).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 8) that prudence 
pertains to active happiness, to which the moral virtues belong.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS181.html#SSQ181A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), if one 
thing be directed to another as its end, it is drawn, especially in moral 
matters, to the species of the thing to which it is directed: for 
instance "he who commits adultery that he may steal, is a thief  rather 
than an adulterer," according to the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 2). Now it is 
evident that the knowledge of prudence is directed to the works of the 
moral virtues as its end, since it is "right reason applied to action" 
(Ethic. vi, 5); so that the ends of the moral virtues are the principles 
of prudence, as the Philosopher says in the same book. Accordingly, as it 
was stated above (<A Href="SS181.html#SSQ181A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3) that the moral virtues in one who directs 
them to the quiet of contemplation belong to the contemplative life, so 
the knowledge of prudence, which is of itself directed to the works of 
the moral virtues, belongs directly to the active life, provided we take 
prudence in its proper sense as the Philosopher speaks of it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, we take it in a more general sense, as comprising any kind 
of human knowledge, then prudence, as regards a certain part thereof, 
belongs to the contemplative life. In this sense Tully (De Offic. i, 5) 
says that "the man who is able most clearly and quickly to grasp the 
truth and to unfold his reasons, is wont to be considered most prudent 
and wise."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Moral works take their species from their end, as stated 
above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,6), wherefore the knowledge pertaining to the 
contemplative life is that which has its end in the very knowledge of 
truth; whereas the knowledge of prudence, through having its end in an 
act of the appetitive power, belongs to the active life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> External occupation makes a man see less in intelligible 
things, which are separated from sensible objects with which the works of 
the active life are concerned. Nevertheless the external occupation of 
the active life enables a man to see more clearly in judging of what is 
to be done, which belongs to prudence, both on account of experience, and 
on account of the mind's attention, since "brains avail when the mind is 
attentive" as Sallust observes [*Bell. Catilin., LI].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Prudence is said to be intermediate between the 
intellectual and the moral virtues because it resides in the same subject 
as the intellectual virtues, and has absolutely the same matter as the 
moral virtues. But this third kind of life is intermediate between the 
active and the contemplative life as regards the things about which it is 
occupied, because it is occupied sometimes with the contemplation of the 
truth, sometimes with eternal things.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether teaching is a work of the active or of the contemplative life?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that teaching is a work not of the active but of 
the contemplative life. For Gregory says (Hom. v in Ezech.) that "the 
perfect who have been able to contemplate heavenly goods, at least 
through a glass, proclaim them to their brethren, whose minds they 
inflame with love for their hidden beauty." But this pertains to 
teaching. Therefore teaching is a work of the  contemplative life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, act and habit would seem to be referable to the same 
kind of life. Now teaching is an act of wisdom: for the Philosopher says 
(Metaph. i, 1) that "to be able to teach is an indication of knowledge." 
Therefore since wisdom or knowledge pertain to the contemplative life, it 
would seem that teaching also belongs to the contemplative life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, prayer, no less than contemplation, is an act of the 
contemplative life. Now prayer, even when one prays for another, belongs 
to the contemplative life. Therefore it would seem that it belongs also 
to the contemplative life to acquaint another, by teaching him, of the 
truth we have meditated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.): "The active life is 
to give bread to the hungry, to teach the ignorant the words of wisdom."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The act of teaching has a twofold object. For teaching is 
conveyed by speech, and speech is the audible sign of the interior 
concept. Accordingly one object of teaching is the matter or object of 
the interior concept; and as to this object teaching belongs sometimes to 
the active, sometimes to the contemplative life. It belongs to the active 
life, when a man conceives a truth inwardly, so as to be directed thereby 
in his outward action; but it belongs to the contemplative life when a 
man conceives an intelligible truth, in the consideration and love 
whereof he delights. Hence Augustine says (De Verb. Dom. Serm. civ, 1): 
"Let them choose for themselves the better part," namely the 
contemplative life, "let them be busy with the word, long for the 
sweetness of teaching, occupy themselves with salutary knowledge," thus 
stating clearly that teaching belongs to the contemplative life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other object of teaching is on the part of the speech heard, and 
thus the object of teaching is the hearer. As to this object all doctrine 
belongs to the active life to which external actions pertain.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The authority quoted speaks expressly of doctrine as to its 
matter, in so far as it is concerned with the consideration and love of 
truth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Habit and act have a common object. Hence this argument 
clearly considers the matter of the interior concept. For it pertains to 
the man having wisdom and knowledge to be able to teach, in so far as he 
is able to express his interior concept in words, so as to bring another 
man to understand the truth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He who prays for another does nothing towards the man for 
whom he prays, but only towards God Who is the intelligible truth; 
whereas he who teaches another does something in his regard by external 
action. Hence the comparison fails.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the active life remains after this life?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the active life remains after this life. For 
the acts of the moral virtues belong to the active life, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS181.html#SSQ181A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But the moral virtues endure after this life according to 
Augustine (De Trin. xiv, 9). Therefore the active life remains after this 
life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, teaching others belongs to the active life, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS181.html#SSQ181A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But in the life to come when "we shall be like the angels," 
teaching will be possible: even as apparently it is in the angels of whom 
one "enlightens, cleanses, and perfects" [*Coel. Hier. iii, viii] 
another, which refers to the "receiving of knowledge," according to 
Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii). Therefore it would seem that the active life 
remains after this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the more lasting a thing is in itself, the more is it 
able to endure after this life. But the active life is seemingly more 
lasting in itself: for Gregory says (Hom. v in Ezech.) that "we can 
remain fixed in the active life, whereas we are nowise able to maintain 
an attentive mind in the contemplative life." Therefore the active life 
is much more able than the contemplative to endure after this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Hom. xiv in Ezech.): "The active life 
ends with this world, but the contemplative life begins here, to be 
perfected in our heavenly home."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS181.html#SSQ181A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the active life has its end in 
external actions: and if these be referred to the quiet of contemplation, 
for that very reason they belong to the contemplative life. But in the 
future life of the blessed the occupation of external actions will cease, 
and if there be any external actions at all, these will be referred to 
contemplation as their end. For, as Augustine says at the end of De 
Civitate Dei xxii, 30, "there we shall rest and we shall see, we shall 
see and love, we shall love and praise." And he had said before (De Civ. 
Dei xxii, 30) that "there God will be seen without end, loved without 
wearying, praised without tiring: such will be the occupation of all, the 
common love, the universal activity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS136.html#SSQ136OUTP1">Question [136]</a>, <A Href="SS136.html#SSQ136A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), the moral virtues 
will remain not as to those actions which are about the means, but as to 
the actions which are about the end. Such acts are those that conduce to 
the quiet of contemplation, which in the words quoted above Augustine 
denotes by "rest," and this rest excludes not only outward disturbances 
but also the inward disturbance of the passions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The contemplative life, as stated above (<A Href="SS180.html#SSQ180OUTP1">Question [180]</a>, <A Href="SS180.html#SSQ180A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), 
consists chiefly in the contemplation of God, and as to this, one angel 
does not teach another, since according to Mt. 18:10, "the little ones' 
angels," who belong to the lower order, "always  see the face of the 
Father"; and so, in the life to come, no man will teach another of God, 
but "we shall" all "see Him as He is" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++3:2">1 Jn. 3:2</a>). This is in keeping 
with the saying of Jeremias 31:34: "They shall teach no more every man 
his neighbor . . . saying: Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the 
least of them even to the greatest."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But as regards things pertaining to the "dispensation of the mysteries 
of God," one angel teaches another by cleansing, enlightening, and 
perfecting him: and thus they have something of the active life so long 
as the world lasts, from the fact that they are occupied in administering 
to the creatures below them. This is signified by the fact that Jacob saw 
angels "ascending" the ladder---which refers to contemplation---and 
"descending" ---which refers to action. Nevertheless, as Gregory remarks 
(Moral. ii, 3), "they do not wander abroad from the Divine vision, so as 
to be deprived of the joys of inward contemplation." Hence in them the 
active life does not differ from the contemplative life as it does in us 
for whom the works of the active life are a hindrance to contemplation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[181] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor is the likeness to the angels promised to us as regards the 
administering to lower creatures, for this is competent to us not by 
reason of our natural order, as it is to the angels, but by reason of our 
seeing God.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That the durability of the active life in the present state 
surpasses the durability of the contemplative life arises not from any 
property of either life considered in itself, but from our own 
deficiency, since we are withheld from the heights of contemplation by 
the weight of the body. Hence Gregory adds (Moral. ii, 3) that "the mind 
through its very weakness being repelled from that immense height recoils 
on itself."<br>
