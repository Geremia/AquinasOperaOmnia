<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that martyrdom is not an act of virtue. For all acts of 
virtue are voluntary. But martyrdom is sometimes not voluntary, as in the 
case of the Innocents who were slain for Christ's sake, and of whom 
Hillary says (Super Matth. i) that "they attained the ripe age of 
eternity through the glory of martyrdom." Therefore martyrdom is not an 
act of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing unlawful is an act of virtue. Now it is unlawful 
to kill oneself, as stated above (<A Href="SS064.html#SSQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>, <A Href="SS064.html#SSQ64A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), and yet martyrdom is 
achieved by so doing: for Augustine says (De Civ. Dei i) that "during 
persecution certain holy women, in order to escape from those who 
threatened their chastity, threw themselves into a river, and so ended 
their lives, and their martyrdom is honored in the Catholic Church with 
most solemn veneration." Therefore martyrdom is not an act of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is praiseworthy to offer oneself to do an act of 
virtue. But it is not praiseworthy to court martyrdom, rather would it 
seem to be presumptuous and rash. Therefore martyrdom is not an act of 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The reward of beatitude is not due save to acts of 
virtue. Now it is due to martyrdom, since it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++5%3A10">Mt. 5:10</a>): 
"Blessed are they that suffer persecution for justice' sake, for theirs 
is the kingdom of heaven." Therefore martyrdom is an act of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3), it belongs to virtue 
to safeguard man in the good of reason. Now the good of reason consists 
in the truth as its proper object, and in justice as its proper effect, 
as shown above (<A Href="SS109.html#SSQ109OUTP1">Question [109]</a>, <A Href="SS109.html#SSQ109ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2; <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>). And martyrdom consists 
essentially in standing firmly to truth and justice against the assaults 
of persecution. Hence it is evident  that martyrdom is an act of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some have said that in the case of the Innocents the use of 
their free will was miraculously accelerated, so that they suffered 
martyrdom even voluntarily. Since, however, Scripture contains no proof 
of this, it is better to say that these babes in being slain obtained by 
God's grace the glory of martyrdom which others acquire by their own 
will. For the shedding of one's blood for Christ's sake takes the place 
of Baptism. Wherefore just as in the case of baptized children the merit 
of Christ is conducive to the acquisition of glory through the baptismal 
grace, so in those who were slain for Christ's sake the merit of Christ's 
martyrdom is conducive to the acquisition of the martyr's palm. Hence 
Augustine says in a sermon on the Epiphany (De Diversis lxvi), as though 
he were addressing them: "A man that does not believe that children are 
benefited by the baptism of Christ will doubt of your being crowned in 
suffering for Christ. You were not old enough to believe in Christ's 
future sufferings, but you had a body wherein you could endure suffering 
of Christ Who was to suffer."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei i) that "possibly the Church 
was induced by certain credible witnesses of Divine authority thus to 
honor the memory of those holy women [*Cf. Question [64], Article [1], ad 2]."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The precepts of the Law are about acts of virtue. Now it 
has been stated (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS108.html#FSQ108OUTP1">Question [108]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS108.html#FSQ108A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 4) that some of the precepts of the 
Divine Law are to be understood in reference to the preparation of the 
mind, in the sense that man ought to be prepared to do such and such a 
thing, whenever expedient. In the same way certain things belong to an 
act of virtue as regards the preparation of the mind, so that in such and 
such a case a man should act according to reason. And this observation 
would seem very much to the point in the case of martyrdom, which 
consists in the right endurance of sufferings unjustly inflicted. Nor 
ought a man to give another an occasion of acting unjustly: yet if anyone 
act unjustly, one ought to endure it in moderation.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether martyrdom is an act of fortitude?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that martyrdom is not an act of fortitude. For the Greek 
{martyr} signifies a witness. Now witness is borne to the faith of 
Christ. according to Acts 1:8, "You shall be witnesses unto Me," etc. and 
Maximus says in a sermon: "The mother of martyrs is the Catholic faith 
which those glorious warriors have sealed with their blood." Therefore 
martyrdom is an act of faith rather than of fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a praiseworthy act belongs chiefly to the virtue which 
inclines thereto, is manifested thereby, and without which the act avails 
nothing. Now charity is the chief incentive to martyrdom: Thus Maximus 
says in a sermon: "The charity of Christ is victorious in His martyrs." 
Again the greatest proof of charity  lies in the act of martyrdom, 
according to Jn. 15:13, "Greater love than this no man hath, that a man 
lay down his life for his friends." Moreover without charity martyrdom 
avails nothing, according to 1 Cor. 13:3, "If I should deliver my body to 
be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing." Therefore 
martyrdom is an act of charity rather than of fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says in a sermon on St. Cyprian: "It is easy 
to honor a martyr by singing his praises, but it is a great thing to 
imitate his faith and patience." Now that which calls chiefly for praise 
in a virtuous act, is the virtue of which it is the act. Therefore 
martyrdom is an act of patience rather than of fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Cyprian says (Ep. ad Mart. et Conf. ii): "Blessed 
martyrs, with what praise shall I extol you? Most valiant warriors, how 
shall I find words to proclaim the strength of your courage?" Now a 
person is praised on account of the virtue whose act he performs. 
Therefore martyrdom is an act of fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, seqq.), it belongs to 
fortitude to strengthen man in the good of virtue, especially against 
dangers, and chiefly against dangers of death, and most of all against 
those that occur in battle. Now it is evident that in martyrdom man is 
firmly strengthened in the good of virtue, since he cleaves to faith and 
justice notwithstanding the threatening danger of death, the imminence of 
which is moreover due to a kind of particular contest with his 
persecutors. Hence Cyprian says in a sermon (Ep. ad Mart. et Conf. ii): 
"The crowd of onlookers wondered to see an unearthly battle, and Christ's 
servants fighting erect, undaunted in speech, with souls unmoved, and 
strength divine." Wherefore it is evident that martyrdom is an act of 
fortitude; for which reason the Church reads in the office of Martyrs: 
They "became valiant in battle" [*Heb. 11:34].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Two things must be considered in the act of fortitude. one 
is the good wherein the brave man is strengthened, and this is the end of 
fortitude; the other is the firmness itself, whereby a man does not yield 
to the contraries that hinder him from achieving that good, and in this 
consists the essence of fortitude. Now just as civic fortitude 
strengthens a man's mind in human justice, for the safeguarding of which 
he braves the danger of death, so gratuitous fortitude strengthens man's 
soul in the good of Divine justice, which is "through faith in Christ 
Jesus," according to Rm. 3:22. Thus martyrdom is related to faith as the 
end in which one is strengthened, but to fortitude as the eliciting habit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Charity inclines one to the act of martyrdom, as its first 
and chief motive cause, being the virtue commanding it, whereas fortitude 
inclines thereto as being its proper motive cause, being the virtue that 
elicits it. Hence martyrdom is an act of charity as commanding, and of 
fortitude as eliciting. For this reason also it manifests both virtues. 
It is due to charity that it  is meritorious, like any other act of 
virtue: and for this reason it avails not without charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), the chief act of fortitude 
is endurance: to this and not to its secondary act, which is aggression, 
martyrdom belongs. And since patience serves fortitude on the part of its 
chief act, viz. endurance, hence it is that martyrs are also praised for 
their patience.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether martyrdom is an act of the greatest perfection?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that martyrdom is not an act of the greatest perfection. 
For seemingly that which is a matter of counsel and not of precept 
pertains to perfection, because, to wit, it is not necessary for 
salvation. But it would seem that martyrdom is necessary for salvation, 
since the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++10%3A10">Rm. 10:10</a>), "With the heart we believe unto 
justice, but with the mouth confession is made unto salvation," and it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++3%3A16">1 Jn. 3:16</a>), that "we ought to lay down our lives for the 
brethren." Therefore martyrdom does not pertain to perfection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it seems to point to greater perfection that a man give 
his soul to God, which is done by obedience, than that he give God his 
body, which is done by martyrdom: wherefore Gregory says (Moral. xxxv) 
that "obedience is preferable to all sacrifices." Therefore martyrdom is 
not an act of the greatest perfection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it would seem better to do good to others than to 
maintain oneself in good, since the "good of the nation is better than 
the good of the individual," according to the Philosopher (Ethic. i, 2). 
Now he that suffers martyrdom profits himself alone, whereas he that 
teaches does good to many. Therefore the act of teaching and guiding 
subjects is more perfect than the act of martyrdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (De Sanct. Virgin. xlvi) prefers martyrdom to 
virginity which pertains to perfection. Therefore martyrdom seems to 
belong to perfection in the highest degree.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We may speak of an act of virtue in two ways. First, with 
regard to the species of that act, as compared to the virtue proximately 
eliciting it. In this way martyrdom, which consists in the due endurance 
of death, cannot be the most perfect of virtuous acts, because endurance 
of death is not praiseworthy in itself, but only in so far as it is 
directed to some good consisting in an act of virtue, such as faith or 
the love of God, so that this act of virtue being the end is better.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A virtuous act may be considered in another way, in comparison with its 
first motive cause, which is the love of charity, and it is in this 
respect that an act comes to belong to the perfection of life, since, as 
the Apostle says (Col. 3:14), that "charity . . .  is the bond of 
perfection." Now, of all virtuous acts martyrdom is the greatest proof of 
the perfection of charity: since a man's love for a thing is proved to be 
so much the greater, according as that which he despises for its sake is 
more dear to him, or that which he chooses to suffer for its sake is more 
odious. But it is evident that of all the goods of the present life man 
loves life itself most, and on the other hand he hates death more than 
anything, especially when it is accompanied by the pains of bodily 
torment, "from fear of which even dumb animals refrain from the greatest 
pleasures," as Augustine observes (<A Href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [83]</a>, qu. 36). And from this point 
of view it is clear that martyrdom is the most perfect of human acts in 
respect of its genus, as being the sign of the greatest charity, 
according to Jn. 15:13: "Greater love than this no man hath, that a man 
lay down his life for his friends."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There is no act of perfection, which is a matter of 
counsel, but what in certain cases is a matter of precept, as being 
necessary for salvation. Thus Augustine declares (De Adult. Conjug. xiii) 
that a man is under the obligation of observing continency, through the 
absence or sickness of his wife. Hence it is not contrary to the 
perfection of martyrdom if in certain cases it be necessary for 
salvation, since there are cases when it is not necessary for salvation 
to suffer martyrdom; thus we read of many holy martyrs who through zeal 
for the faith or brotherly love gave themselves up to martyrdom of their 
own accord. As to these precepts, they are to be understood as referring 
to the preparation of the mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Martyrdom embraces the highest possible degree of 
obedience, namely obedience unto death; thus we read of Christ (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++2%3A8">Phil. 2:8</a>) that He became "obedient unto death." Hence it is evident that 
martyrdom is of itself more perfect than obedience considered absolutely.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers martyrdom according to the proper 
species of its act, whence it derives no excellence over all other 
virtuous acts; thus neither is fortitude more excellent than all virtues.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether death is essential to martyrdom?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that death is not essential to martyrdom. For Jerome 
says in a sermon on the Assumption (Epist. ad Paul. et Eustoch.): "I 
should say rightly that the Mother of God was both virgin and martyr, 
although she ended her days in peace": and Gregory says (Hom. iii in 
Evang.): "Although persecution has ceased to offer the opportunity, yet 
the peace we enjoy is not without its martyrdom, since even if we no 
longer yield the life of the body to the sword, yet do we slay fleshly 
desires in the soul with the sword of the spirit." Therefore there can be 
martyrdom without suffering death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we read of certain women as commended for  despising 
life for the sake of safeguarding the integrity of the flesh: wherefore 
seemingly the integrity of chastity is preferable to the life of the 
body. Now sometimes the integrity of the flesh has been forfeited or has 
been threatened in confession of the Christian faith, as in the case of 
Agnes and Lucy. Therefore it seems that the name of martyr should be 
accorded to a woman who forfeits the integrity of the flesh for the sake 
of Christ's faith, rather than if she were to forfeit even the life of 
the body: wherefore also Lucy said: "If thou causest me to be violated 
against my will, my chastity will gain me a twofold crown."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, martyrdom is an act of fortitude. But it belongs to 
fortitude to brave not only death but also other hardships, as Augustine 
declares (Music. vi). Now there are many other hardships besides death, 
which one may suffer for Christ's faith, namely imprisonment, exile, 
being stripped of one's goods, as mentioned in Heb. 10:34, for which 
reason we celebrate the martyrdom of Pope Saint Marcellus, 
notwithstanding that he died in prison. Therefore it is not essential to 
martyrdom that one suffer the pain of death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, martyrdom is a meritorious act, as stated above (<A Href="SS124.html#SSQ124A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="SS124.html#SSQ124A2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Now it cannot be a meritorious act after death. Therefore it 
is before death; and consequently death is not essential to martyrdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Maximus says in a sermon on the martyrs that "in dying 
for the faith he conquers who would have been vanquished in living 
without faith."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I answer that As stated above (<A Href="SS124.html#SSQ124A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), a martyr is so called as being a 
witness to the Christian faith, which teaches us to despise things 
visible for the sake of things invisible, as stated in Heb. 11. 
Accordingly it belongs to martyrdom that a man bear witness to the faith 
in showing by deed that he despises all things present, in order to 
obtain invisible goods to come. Now so long as a man retains the life of 
the body he does not show by deed that he despises all things relating to 
the body. For men are wont to despise both their kindred and all they 
possess, and even to suffer bodily pain, rather than lose life. Hence 
Satan testified against Job (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+2%3A4">Job 2:4</a>): "Skin for skin, and all that a man 
hath he will give for his soul" [Douay: 'life'] i.e. for the life of his 
body. Therefore the perfect notion of martyrdom requires that a man 
suffer death for Christ's sake.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The authorities quoted, and the like that one may meet 
with, speak of martyrdom by way of similitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When a woman forfeits the integrity of the flesh, or is 
condemned to forfeit it under pretext of the Christian faith, it is not 
evident to men whether she suffers this for love of the Christian faith, 
or rather through contempt of chastity. Wherefore in the sight of men her 
testimony is not held to be sufficient, and consequently this is not 
martyrdom properly speaking. In the sight  of God, however, Who searcheth 
the heart, this may be deemed worthy of a reward, as Lucy said.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5), fortitude regards danger 
of death chiefly, and other dangers consequently; wherefore a person is 
not called a martyr merely for suffering imprisonment, or exile, or 
forfeiture of his wealth, except in so far as these result in death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The merit of martyrdom is not after death, but in the 
voluntary endurance of death, namely in the fact that a person willingly 
suffers being put to death. It happens sometimes, however, that a man 
lives for some time after being mortally wounded for Christ's sake, or 
after suffering for the faith of Christ any other kind of hardship 
inflicted by persecution and continued until death ensues. The act of 
martyrdom is meritorious while a man is in this state, and at the very 
time that he is suffering these hardships.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether faith alone is the cause of martyrdom?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that faith alone is the cause of martyrdom. For it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Pt++4%3A15,16">1 Pt. 4:15,16</a>): "Let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a 
thief, or a railer, or a coveter of other men's things. But if as a 
Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name." 
Now a man is said to be a Christian because he holds the faith of Christ. 
Therefore only faith in Christ gives the glory of martyrdom to those who 
suffer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a martyr is a kind of witness. But witness is borne to 
the truth alone. Now one is not called a martyr for bearing witness to 
any truth, but only for witnessing to the Divine truth, otherwise a man 
would be a martyr if he were to die for confessing a truth of geometry or 
some other speculative science, which seems ridiculous. Therefore faith 
alone is the cause of martyrdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, those virtuous deeds would seem to be of most account 
which are directed to the common good, since "the good of the nation is 
better than the good of the individual," according to the Philosopher 
(Ethic. i, 2). If, then, some other good were the cause of martyrdom, it 
would seem that before all those would be martyrs who die for the defense 
of their country. Yet this is not consistent with Church observance, for 
we do not celebrate the martyrdom of those who die in a just war. 
Therefore faith alone is the cause of martyrdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++5%3A10">Mt. 5:10</a>): "Blessed are they that suffer 
persecution for justice' sake," which pertains to martyrdom, according to 
a gloss, as well as Jerome's commentary on this passage. Now not only 
faith but also the other virtues pertain to justice. Therefore other 
virtues can be the cause of martyrdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[5] Body Para. 1/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS124.html#SSQ124A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), martyrs are so called as being 
witnesses, because by suffering in body unto death they bear witness to 
the truth; not indeed to any truth, but to the truth which is in 
accordance with godliness, and was made known to us by Christ: wherefore 
Christ's martyrs are His witnesses. Now this truth is the truth of faith. 
Wherefore the cause of all martyrdom is the truth of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the truth of faith includes not only inward belief, but also outward 
profession, which is expressed not only by words, whereby one confesses 
the faith, but also by deeds, whereby a person shows that he has faith, 
according to James 2:18, "I will show thee, by works, my faith." Hence it 
is written of certain people (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Titus+1%3A16">Titus 1:16</a>): "They profess that they know 
God but in their works they deny Him." Thus all virtuous deeds, inasmuch 
as they are referred to God, are professions of the faith whereby we come 
to know that God requires these works of us, and rewards us for them: and 
in this way they can be the cause of martyrdom. For this reason the 
Church celebrates the martyrdom of Blessed John the Baptist, who suffered 
death, not for refusing to deny the faith, but for reproving adultery.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A Christian is one who is Christ's. Now a person is said to 
be Christ's, not only through having faith in Christ, but also because he 
is actuated to virtuous deeds by the Spirit of Christ, according to Rm. 
8:9, "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His"; and 
again because in imitation of Christ he is dead to sins, according to 
Gal. 5:24, "They that are Christ's have crucified their flesh with the 
vices and concupiscences." Hence to suffer as a Christian is not only to 
suffer in confession of the faith, which is done by words, but also to 
suffer for doing any good work, or for avoiding any sin, for Christ's 
sake, because this all comes under the head of witnessing to the faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The truth of other sciences has no connection with the 
worship of the Godhead: hence it is not called truth according to 
godliness, and consequently the confession thereof cannot be said to be 
the direct cause of martyrdom. Yet, since every lie is a sin, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS110.html#SSQ110OUTP1">Question [110]</a>, <A Href="SS110.html#SSQ110ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), avoidance of a lie, to whatever truth it may be 
contrary, may be the cause of martyrdom inasmuch as a lie is a sin 
against the Divine Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[124] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The good of one's country is paramount among human goods: 
yet the Divine good, which is the proper cause of martyrdom, is of more 
account than human good. Nevertheless, since human good may become 
Divine, for instance when it is referred to God, it follows that any 
human good in so far as it is referred to God, may be the cause of 
martyrdom.<br>
