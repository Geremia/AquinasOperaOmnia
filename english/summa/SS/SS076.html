<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider cursing. Under this head there are four points of 
inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS076.html#SSQ76A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether one may lawfully curse another?

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is lawful to curse anyone?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful to curse anyone. For it is unlawful to 
disregard the command of the Apostle in whom Christ spoke, according to 2 
Cor. 13:3. Now he commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++12:14">Rm. 12:14</a>), "Bless and curse not." Therefore 
it is not lawful to curse anyone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, all are bound to bless God, according to Dan. 3:82, "O 
ye sons of men, bless the Lord." Now the same mouth cannot both bless God 
and curse man, as proved in the third chapter of James. Therefore no man 
may lawfully curse another man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, he that curses another would seem to wish him some evil 
either of fault or of punishment, since a curse appears to be a kind of 
imprecation. But it is not lawful to wish ill to anyone, indeed we are 
bound to pray that all may be delivered from  evil. Therefore it is 
unlawful for any man to curse.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the devil exceeds all in malice on account of his 
obstinacy. But it is not lawful to curse the devil, as neither is it 
lawful to curse oneself; for it is written (Ecclus. 21:30): "While the 
ungodly curseth the devil, he curseth his own soul." Much less therefore 
is it lawful to curse a man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, a gloss on Num. 23:8, "How shall I curse whom God hath 
not cursed?" says: "There cannot be a just cause for cursing a sinner if 
one be ignorant of his sentiments." Now one man cannot know another man's 
sentiments, nor whether he is cursed by God. Therefore no man may 
lawfully curse another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++27:26">Dt. 27:26</a>): "Cursed be he that abideth 
not in the words of this law." Moreover Eliseus cursed the little boys 
who mocked him (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Kgs++2:24">4 Kgs. 2:24</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> To curse [maledicere] is the same as to speak ill [malum 
dicere]. Now "speaking" has a threefold relation to the thing spoken. 
First, by way of assertion, as when a thing is expressed in the 
indicative mood: in this way "maledicere" signifies simply to tell 
someone of another's evil, and this pertains to backbiting, wherefore 
tellers of evil [maledici] are sometimes called backbiters. Secondly, 
speaking is related to the thing spoken, by way of cause, and this 
belongs to God first and foremost, since He made all things by His word, 
according to Ps. 32:9, "He spoke and they were made"; while secondarily 
it belongs to man, who, by his word, commands others and thus moves them 
to do something: it is for this purpose that we employ verbs in the 
imperative mood. Thirdly, "speaking" is related to the thing spoken by 
expressing the sentiments of one who desires that which is expressed in 
words; and for this purpose we employ the verb in the optative mood.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly we may omit the first kind of evil speaking which is by way 
of simple assertion of evil, and consider the other two kinds. And here 
we must observe that to do something and to will it are consequent on one 
another in the matter of goodness and wickedness, as shown above (FS, 
Question [20], Article [3]). Hence in these two ways of evil speaking, by way of command 
and by way of desire, there is the same aspect of lawfulness and 
unlawfulness, for if a man commands or desires another's evil, as evil, 
being intent on the evil itself, then evil speaking will be unlawful in 
both ways, and this is what is meant by cursing. On the other hand if a 
man commands or desires another's evil under the aspect of good, it is 
lawful; and it may be called cursing, not strictly speaking, but 
accidentally, because the chief intention of the speaker is directed not 
to evil but to good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now evil may be spoken, by commanding or desiring it, under the aspect 
of a twofold good. Sometimes under the aspect of just, and thus a judge 
lawfully curses a man whom he condemns to a just penalty: thus too the 
Church curses by pronouncing anathema. In the  same way the prophets in 
the Scriptures sometimes call down evils on sinners, as though conforming 
their will to Divine justice, although such like imprecation may be taken 
by way of foretelling. Sometimes evil is spoken under the aspect of 
useful, as when one wishes a sinner to suffer sickness or hindrance of 
some kind, either that he may himself reform, or at least that he may 
cease from harming others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle forbids cursing strictly so called with an evil 
intent: and the same answer applies to the Second Objection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To wish another man evil under the aspect of good, is not 
opposed to the sentiment whereby one wishes him good simply, in fact 
rather is it in conformity therewith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In the devil both nature and guilt must be considered. His 
nature indeed is good and is from God nor is it lawful to curse it. On 
the other hand his guilt is deserving of being cursed, according to Job 
3:8, "Let them curse it who curse the day." Yet when a sinner curses the 
devil on account of his guilt, for the same reason he judges himself 
worthy of being cursed; and in this sense he is said to curse his own 
soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Although the sinner's sentiments cannot be perceived in 
themselves, they can be perceived through some manifest sin, which has to 
be punished. Likewise although it is not possible to know whom God curses 
in respect of final reprobation, it is possible to know who is accursed 
of God in respect of being guilty of present sin.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is unlawful to curse an irrational 
creature. Cursing would seem to be lawful chiefly in its relation to 
punishment. Now irrational creatures are not competent subjects either of 
guilt or of punishment. Therefore it is unlawful to curse them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in an irrational creature there is nothing but the 
nature which God made. But it is unlawful to curse this even in the 
devil, as stated above (<A Href="SS076.html#SSQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore it is nowise lawful to curse an 
irrational creature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, irrational creatures are either stable, as bodies, or 
transient, as the seasons. Now, according to Gregory (Moral. iv, 2), "it 
is useless to curse what does not exist, and wicked to curse what 
exists." Therefore it is nowise lawful to curse an irrational creature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord cursed the fig tree, as related in Mt. 21:19; 
and Job cursed his day, according to Job 3:1.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[2] Body Para. 1/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Benediction and malediction, properly speaking, regard 
things to which good or evil may happen, viz. rational creatures: while 
good and evil are said to happen to irrational creatures in relation to 
the rational creature for whose sake they are. Now they are related to 
the rational creature in several ways. First by way of ministration, in 
so far as irrational creatures minister to the needs of man. In this 
sense the Lord said to man (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gn++3:17">Gn. 3:17</a>): "Cursed is the earth in thy work," 
so that its barrenness would be a punishment to man. Thus also David 
cursed the mountains of Gelboe, according to Gregory's expounding (Moral. 
iv, 3). Again the irrational creature is related to the rational creature 
by way of signification: and thus our Lord cursed the fig tree in 
signification of Judea. Thirdly, the irrational creature is related to 
rational creatures as something containing them, namely by way of time or 
place: and thus Job cursed the day of his birth, on account of the 
original sin which he contracted in birth, and on account of the 
consequent penalties. In this sense also we may understand David to have 
cursed the mountains of Gelboe, as we read in 2 Kgs. 1:21, namely on 
account of the people slaughtered there.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But to curse irrational beings, considered as creatures of God, is a sin 
of blasphemy; while to curse them considered in themselves is idle and 
vain and consequently unlawful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this the Replies to the objections may easily be gathered.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that cursing is not a mortal sin. For Augustine in 
a homily On the Fire of Purgatory [*Serm. civ in the appendix of St. 
Augustine's works] reckons cursing among slight sins. But such sins are 
venial. Therefore cursing is not a mortal but a venial Sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which proceeds from a slight movement of the mind 
does not seem to be generically a mortal sin. But cursing sometimes 
arises from a slight movement. Therefore cursing is not a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, evil deeds are worse than evil words. But evil deeds are 
not always mortal sins. Much less therefore is cursing a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Nothing save mortal sin excludes one from the kingdom 
of God. But cursing excludes from the kingdom of God, according to 1 Cor. 
6:10, "Nor cursers [Douay: 'railers'], nor extortioners shall possess the 
kingdom of God." Therefore cursing is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The evil words of which we are speaking now are those 
whereby evil is uttered against someone by way of command or desire. Now 
to wish evil to another man, or to conduce to that evil  by commanding 
it, is, of its very nature, contrary to charity whereby we love our 
neighbor by desiring his good. Consequently it is a mortal sin, according 
to its genus, and so much the graver, as the person whom we curse has a 
greater claim on our love and respect. Hence it is written (Lev. 20:9): 
"He that curseth his father, or mother, dying let him die."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It may happen however that the word uttered in cursing is a venial sin 
either through the slightness of the evil invoked on another in cursing 
him, or on account of the sentiments of the person who utters the curse; 
because he may say such words through some slight movement, or in jest, 
or without deliberation, and sins of word should be weighed chiefly with 
regard to the speaker's intention, as stated above (<A Href="SS072.html#SSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="SS072.html#SSQ72A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether cursing is a graver sin than backbiting?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that cursing is a graver sin than backbiting. 
Cursing would seem to be a kind of blasphemy, as implied in the canonical 
epistle of Jude (verse 9) where it is said that "when Michael the 
archangel, disputing with the devil, contended about the body of Moses, 
he durst not bring against him the judgment of blasphemy [Douay: 'railing 
speech']," where blasphemy stands for cursing, according to a gloss. Now 
blasphemy is a graver sin than backbiting. Therefore cursing is a graver 
sin than backbiting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, murder is more grievous than backbiting, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS073.html#SSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="SS073.html#SSQ73A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But cursing is on a par with the sin of murder; for 
Chrysostom says (Hom. xix, super Matth.): "When thou sayest: 'Curse him 
down with his house, away with everything,' you are no better than a 
murderer." Therefore cursing is graver than backbiting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to cause a thing is more than to signify it. But the 
curser causes evil by commanding it, whereas the backbiter merely 
signifies an evil already existing. Therefore the curser sins more 
grievously than the backbiter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is impossible to do well in backbiting, whereas 
cursing may be either a good or an evil deed, as appears from what has 
been said (<A Href="SS076.html#SSQ76A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore backbiting is graver than cursing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated in the FP, Question [48], Article [5], evil is twofold, evil 
of fault, and evil of punishment; and of the two, evil of fault is the 
worse (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP048.html#FPQ48OUTP1">Question [48]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP048.html#FPQ48A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Hence to speak evil of fault is worse than to 
speak evil of punishment, provided the mode of speaking be the same. 
Accordingly it belongs to the reviler, the tale-bearer, the backbiter and 
the derider to speak evil of fault,  whereas it belongs to the 
evil-speaker, as we understand it here, to speak evil of punishment, and 
not evil of fault except under the aspect of punishment. But the mode of 
speaking is not the same, for in the case of the four vices mentioned 
above, evil of fault is spoken by way of assertion, whereas in the case 
of cursing evil of punishment is spoken, either by causing it in the form 
of a command, or by wishing it. Now the utterance itself of a person's 
fault is a sin, in as much as it inflicts an injury on one's neighbor, 
and it is more grievous to inflict an injury, than to wish to inflict it, 
other things being equal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence backbiting considered in its generic aspect is a graver sin than 
the cursing which expresses a mere desire; while the cursing which is 
expressed by way of command, since it has the aspect of a cause, will be 
more or less grievous than backbiting, according as it inflicts an injury 
more or less grave than the blackening of a man's good name. Moreover 
this must be taken as applying to these vices considered in their 
essential aspects: for other accidental points might be taken into 
consideration, which would aggravate or extenuate the aforesaid vices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To curse a creature, as such, reflects on God, and thus 
accidentally it has the character of blasphemy; not so if one curse a 
creature on account of its fault: and the same applies to backbiting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS076.html#SSQ76A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), cursing, in one way, includes the 
desire for evil, where if the curser desire the evil of another's violent 
death, he does not differ, in desire, from a murderer, but he differs 
from him in so far as the external act adds something to the act of the 
will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[76] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers cursing by way of command.
