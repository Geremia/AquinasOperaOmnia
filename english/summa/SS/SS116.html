<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that quarreling is not opposed to the virtue of 
friendship or affability. For quarreling seems to pertain to  discord, 
just as contention does. But discord is opposed to charity, as stated 
above (<A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS037.html#SSQ37OUTP1">Question [37]</a>, <A Href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/summa/SS/SS037.html#SSQ37A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore quarreling is also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++26%3A21">Prov. 26:21</a>): "An angry man stirreth up 
strife." Now anger is opposed to meekness. Therefore strife or quarreling 
is also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+4%3A1">James 4:1</a>): "From whence are wars and 
quarrels [Douay: 'contentions'] among you? Are they not hence, from your 
concupiscences which war in your members?" Now it would seem contrary to 
temperance to follow one's concupiscences. Therefore it seems that 
quarreling is opposed not to friendship but to temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher opposes quarreling to friendship 
(Ethic. iv, 6).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Quarreling consists properly in words, when, namely, one 
person contradicts another's words. Now two things may be observed in 
this contradiction. For sometimes contradiction arises on account of the 
person who speaks, the contradictor refusing to consent with him from 
lack of that love which unites minds together, and this seems to pertain 
to discord, which is contrary to charity. Whereas at times contradiction 
arises by reason of the speaker being a person to whom someone does not 
fear to be disagreeable: whence arises quarreling, which is opposed to 
the aforesaid friendship or affability, to which it belongs to behave 
agreeably towards those among whom we dwell. Hence the Philosopher says 
(Ethic. iv, 6) that "those who are opposed to everything with the intent 
of being disagreeable, and care for nobody, are said to be peevish and 
quarrelsome."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Contention pertains rather to the contradiction of discord, 
while quarreling belongs to the contradiction which has the intention of 
displeasing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The direct opposition of virtues to vices depends, not on 
their causes, since one vice may arise from many causes, but on the 
species of their acts. And although quarreling arises at times from 
anger, it may arise from many other causes, hence it does not follow that 
it is directly opposed to meekness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> James speaks there of concupiscence considered as a general 
evil whence all vices arise. Thus, a gloss on Rm. 7:7 says: "The law is 
good, since by forbidding concupiscence, it forbids all evil."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether quarreling is a more grievous sin than flattery?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that quarreling is a less grievous sin than the contrary 
vice, viz. adulation or flattery. For the more harm a sin does the more 
grievous it seems to be. Now flattery does more harm than quarreling, for 
it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++3%3A12">Is. 3:12</a>): "O My people,  they that call thee blessed, the 
same deceive thee, and destroy the way of thy steps." Therefore flattery 
is a more grievous sin than quarreling.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there appears to be a certain amount of deceit in 
flattery, since the flatterer says one thing, and thinks another: whereas 
the quarrelsome man is without deceit, for he contradicts openly. Now he 
that sins deceitfully is a viler man, according to the Philosopher 
(Ethic. vii, 6). Therefore flattery is a more grievous sin than 
quarreling.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, shame is fear of what is vile, according to the 
Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 9). But a man is more ashamed to be a flatterer 
than a quarreler. Therefore quarreling is a less grievous sin than 
flattery.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The more a sin is inconsistent with the spiritual 
state, the more it appears to be grievous. Now quarreling seems to be 
more inconsistent with the spiritual state: for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++3%3A2,3">1 Tim. 3:2,3</a>) that it "behooveth a bishop to be . . . not quarrelsome"; and (2 
Tim. 3:24): "The servant of the Lord must not wrangle." Therefore 
quarreling seems to be a more grievous sin than flattery.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We can speak of each of these sins in two ways. In one 
way we may consider the species of either sin, and thus the more a vice 
is at variance with the opposite virtue the more grievous it is. Now the 
virtue of friendship has a greater tendency to please than to displease: 
and so the quarrelsome man, who exceeds in giving displeasure sins more 
grievously than the adulator or flatterer, who exceeds in giving 
pleasure. In another way we may consider them as regards certain external 
motives, and thus flattery sometimes more grievous, for instance when one 
intends by deception to acquire undue honor or gain: while sometimes 
quarreling is more grievous; for instance, when one intends either to 
deny the truth, or to hold up the speaker to contempt.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as the flatterer may do harm by deceiving secretly, so 
the quarreler may do harm sometimes by assailing openly. Now, other 
things being equal, it is more grievous to harm a person openly, by 
violence as it were, than secretly. Wherefore robbery is a more grievous 
sin than theft, as stated above (<A Href="SS066.html#SSQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="SS066.html#SSQ66A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In human acts, the more grievous is not always the more 
vile. For the comeliness of a man has its source in his reason: wherefore 
the sins of the flesh, whereby the flesh enslaves the reason, are viler, 
although spiritual sins are more grievous, since they proceed from 
greater contempt. In like manner, sins that are committed through deceit 
are viler, in so far as they seem to arise from a certain weakness, and 
from a certain falseness of the reason, although sins that are committed 
openly proceed sometimes from a greater contempt. Hence flattery, through 
being accompanied  by deceit, seems to be a viler sin; while quarreling, 
through proceeding from greater contempt, is apparently more grievous.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[116] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated in the objection, shame regards the vileness of a 
sin; wherefore a man is not always more ashamed of a more grievous sin, 
but of a viler sin. Hence it is that a man is more ashamed of flattery 
than of quarreling, although quarreling is more grievous.<br>
