  <h3 align="left">Whether the desire of glory is a sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the desire of glory is not a sin.
    For no one sins in being likened to God: in fact we are commanded (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A1"
      >Eph. 5:1</a
    >): "Be ye... followers of God, as most dear children." Now by seeking glory
    man seems to imitate God, Who seeks glory from men: wherefore it is written
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++43%3A6,7">Is. 43:6,7</a
    >): "Bring My sons from afar, and My daughters from the ends of the earth.
    And every one that calleth on My name, I have created him for My glory."
    Therefore the desire for glory is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which incites a mar to do good is
    apparently not a sin. Now the desire of glory incites men to do good. For
    Tully says (De Tusc. Quaest. i) that "glory inflames every man to strive his
    utmost": and in Holy Writ glory is promised for good works, according to Rm.
    2:7: "To them, indeed, who according to patience in good work... glory and
    honor" [*Vulg.: 'Who will render to every man according to his works, to
    them indeed who... seek glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life.'].
    Therefore the desire for glory is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii) that
    glory is "consistent good report about a person, together with praise": and
    this comes to the same as what Augustine says (Contra Maximin. iii), viz.
    that glory is, "as it were, clear knowledge with praise." Now it is no sin
    to desire praiseworthy renown: indeed, it seems itself to call for praise,
    according to Ecclus. 41:15, "Take care of a good name," and Rm. 12:17,
    "Providing good things not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight
    of all men." Therefore the desire of vainglory is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei v): "He is better
    advised who acknowledges that even the love of praise is sinful."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Glory signifies a certain clarity, wherefore
    Augustine says (Tract. lxxxii, c, cxiv in Joan.) that to be "glorified is
    the same as to be clarified." Now clarity and comeliness imply a certain
    display: wherefore the word glory properly denotes the display of something
    as regards its seeming comely in the sight of men, whether it be a bodily or
    a spiritual good. Since, however, that which is clear simply can be seen by
    many, and by those who are far away, it follows that the word glory properly
    denotes that somebody's good is known and approved by many, according to the
    saying of Sallust (Catilin.) [*The quotation is from Livy: Hist., Lib. XXII
    C, 39]: "I must not boast while I am addressing one man."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if we take the word glory in a broader sense, it not only consists in
    the knowledge of many, but also in the knowledge of few, or of one, or of
    oneself alone, as when one considers one's own good as being worthy of
    praise. Now it is not a sin to know and approve one's own good: for it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++2%3A12"
      >1 Cor. 2:12</a
    >): "Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that
    is of God that we may know the things that are given us from God." Likewise
    it is not a sin to be willing to approve one's own good works: for it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++5%3A16"
      >Mt. 5:16</a
    >): "Let your light shine before men." Hence the desire for glory does not,
    of itself, denote a sin: but the desire for empty or vain glory denotes a
    sin: for it is sinful to desire anything vain, according to Ps. 4:3, "Why do
    you love vanity, and seek after lying?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now glory may be called vain in three ways. First, on the part of the thing
    for which one seeks glory: as when a man seeks glory for that which is
    unworthy of glory, for instance when he seeks it for something frail and
    perishable: secondly, on the part of him from whom he seeks glory, for
    instance a man whose judgment is uncertain: thirdly, on the part of the man
    himself who seeks glory, for that he does not refer the desire of his own
    glory to a due end, such as God's honor, or the spiritual welfare of his
    neighbor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says on Jn. 13:13, "You
    call Me Master and Lord; and you say well" (Tract. lviii in Joan.):
    "Self-complacency is fraught with danger of one who has to beware of pride.
    But He Who is above all, however much He may praise Himself, does not uplift
    Himself. For knowledge of God is our need, not His: nor does any man know
    Him unless he be taught of Him Who knows." It is therefore evident that God
    seeks glory, not for His own sake, but for ours. In like manner a man may
    rightly seek his own glory for the good of others, according to Mt. 5:16,
    "That they may see your good works, and glorify your Father Who is in
    heaven."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That which we receive from God is not
    vain but true glory: it is this glory that is promised as a reward for good
    works, and of which it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++10%3A17,18"
      >2 Cor. 10:17,18</a
    >): "He that glorieth let him glory in the Lord, for not he who commendeth
    himself is approved, but he whom God commendeth." It is true that some are
    heartened to do works of virtue, through desire for human glory, as also
    through the desire for other earthly goods. Yet he is not truly virtuous who
    does virtuous deeds for the sake of human glory, as Augustine proves (De
    Civ. Dei v).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is requisite for man's perfection
    that he should know himself; but not that he should be known by others,
    wherefore it is not to be desired in itself. It may, however, be desired as
    being useful for something, either in order that God may be glorified by
    men, or that men may become better by reason of the good they know to be in
    another man, or in order that man, knowing by the testimony of others'
    praise the good which is in him, may himself strive to persevere therein and
    to become better. In this sense it is praiseworthy that a man should "take
    care of his good name," and that he should "provide good things in the sight
    of God and men": but not that he should take an empty pleasure in human
    praise.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether vainglory is opposed to magnanimity?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that vainglory is not opposed to
    magnanimity. For, as stated above (<a href="SS132.html#SSQ132A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), vainglory consists in glorying in things that are not, which pertains to
    falsehood; or in earthly and perishable things, which pertains to
    covetousness; or in the testimony of men, whose judgment is uncertain, which
    pertains to imprudence. Now these vices are not contrary to magnanimity.
    Therefore vainglory is not opposed to magnanimity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, vainglory is not, like pusillanimity,
    opposed to magnanimity by way of deficiency, for this seems inconsistent
    with vainglory. Nor is it opposed to it by way of excess, for in this way
    presumption and ambition are opposed to magnanimity, as stated above (<a
      href="SS130.html#SSQ130OUTP1"
      >Question [130]</a
    >, <a href="SS130.html#SSQ130A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="SS131.html#SSQ131OUTP1">Question [131]</a>,
    <a href="SS131.html#SSQ131A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>): and these differ from
    vainglory. Therefore vainglory is not opposed to magnanimity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a gloss on Phil. 2:3, "Let nothing be
    done through contention, neither by vainglory," says: "Some among them were
    given to dissension and restlessness, contending with one another for the
    sake of vainglory." But contention [*Cf. Question [38]] is not opposed to
    magnanimity. Neither therefore is vainglory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully says (De Offic. i) under the heading,
    "Magnanimity consists in two things: We should beware of the desire for
    glory, since it enslaves the mind, which a magnanimous man should ever
    strive to keep untrammeled." Therefore it is opposed to magnanimity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS103.html#SSQ103OUTP1"
      >Question [103]</a
    >, <a href="SS103.html#SSQ103A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3), glory is an
    effect of honor and praise: because from the fact that a man is praised, or
    shown any kind of reverence, he acquires charity in the knowledge of others.
    And since magnanimity is about honor, as stated above (<a
      href="SS129.html#SSQ129OUTP1"
      >Question [129]</a
    >, <a href="SS129.html#SSQ129ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), it follows that it
    also is about glory: seeing that as a man uses honor moderately, so too does
    he use glory in moderation. Wherefore inordinate desire of glory is directly
    opposed to magnanimity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To think so much of little things as to
    glory in them is itself opposed to magnanimity. Wherefore it is said of the
    magnanimous man (Ethic. iv) that honor is of little account to him. In like
    manner he thinks little of other things that are sought for honor's sake,
    such as power and wealth. Likewise it is inconsistent with magnanimity to
    glory in things that are not; wherefore it is said of the magnanimous man
    (Ethic. iv) that he cares more for truth than for opinion. Again it is
    incompatible with magnanimity for a man to glory in the testimony of human
    praise, as though he deemed this something great; wherefore it is said of
    the magnanimous man (Ethic. iv), that he cares not to be praised. And so,
    when a man looks upon little things as though they were great, nothing
    hinders this from being contrary to magnanimity, as well as to other
    virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> He that is desirous of vainglory does in
    truth fall short of being magnanimous, because he glories in what the
    magnanimous man thinks little of, as stated in the preceding Reply. But if
    we consider his estimate, he is opposed to the magnanimous man by way of
    excess, because the glory which he seeks is something great in his
    estimation, and he tends thereto in excess of his deserts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS127.html#SSQ127OUTP1"
      >Question [127]</a
    >, <a href="SS127.html#SSQ127A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2), the opposition
    of vices does not depend on their effects. Nevertheless contention, if done
    intentionally, is opposed to magnanimity: since no one contends save for
    what he deems great. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 3) that the
    magnanimous man is not contentious, because nothing is great in his
    estimation.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether vainglory is a mortal sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that vainglory is a mortal sin. For
    nothing precludes the eternal reward except a mortal sin. Now vainglory
    precludes the eternal reward: for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A1"
      >Mt. 6:1</a
    >): "Take heed, that you do not give justice before men, to be seen by them:
    otherwise you shall not have a reward of your Father Who is in heaven."
    Therefore vainglory is a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever appropriates to himself that
    which is proper to God, sins mortally. Now by desiring vainglory, a man
    appropriates to himself that which is proper to God. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++42%3A8"
      >Is. 42:8</a
    >): "I will not give My glory to another," and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++1%3A17"
      >1 Tim. 1:17</a
    >): "To... the only God be honor and glory." Therefore vainglory is a mortal
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, apparently a sin is mortal if it be most
    dangerous and harmful. Now vainglory is a sin of this kind, because a gloss
    of Augustine on 1 Thess. 2:4, "God, Who proveth our hearts," says: "Unless a
    man war against the love of human glory he does not perceive its baneful
    power, for though it be easy for anyone not to desire praise as long as one
    does not get it, it is difficult not to take pleasure in it, when it is
    given." Chrysostom also says (Hom. xix in Matth.) that "vainglory enters
    secretly, and robs us insensibly of all our inward possessions." Therefore
    vainglory is a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Chrysostom says [*Hom. xiii in the Opus
    Imperfectum falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom] that "while other vices
    find their abode in the servants of the devil, vainglory finds a place even
    in the servants of Christ." Yet in the latter there is no mortal sin.
    Therefore vainglory is not a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS024.html#SSQ24OUTP1"
      >Question [24]</a
    >, <a href="SS024.html#SSQ24A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>;
    <a href="SS110.html#SSQ110OUTP1">Question [110]</a>,
    <a href="SS110.html#SSQ110A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>;
    <a href="SS112.html#SSQ112OUTP1">Question [112]</a>,
    <a href="SS112.html#SSQ112A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), a sin is mortal through
    being contrary to charity. Now the sin of vainglory, considered in itself,
    does not seem to be contrary to charity as regards the love of one's
    neighbor: yet as regards the love of God it may be contrary to charity in
    two ways. In one way, by reason of the matter about which one glories: for
    instance when one glories in something false that is opposed to the
    reverence we owe God, according to Ezech. 28:2, "Thy heart is lifted up, and
    Thou hast said: I am God," and 1 Cor. 4:7, "What hast thou that thou hast
    not received? And if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou
    hadst not received it?" Or again when a man prefers to God the temporal good
    in which he glories: for this is forbidden (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++9%3A23,24"
      >Jer. 9:23,24</a
    >): "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, and let not the strong man
    glory in his strength, and let not the rich man glory in his riches. But let
    him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me." Or
    again when a man prefers the testimony of man to God's; thus it is written
    in reproval of certain people (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++12%3A43"
      >Jn. 12:43</a
    >): "For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In another way vainglory may be contrary to charity, on the part of the one
    who glories, in that he refers his intention to glory as his last end: so
    that he directs even virtuous deeds thereto, and, in order to obtain it,
    forbears not from doing even that which is against God. In this way it is a
    mortal sin. Wherefore Augustine says (De Civ. Dei v, 14) that "this vice,"
    namely the love of human praise, "is so hostile to a godly faith, if the
    heart desires glory more than it fears or loves God, that our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++5%3A44"
      >Jn. 5:44</a
    >): How can you believe, who receive glory one from another, and the glory
    which is from God alone, you do not seek?"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    If, however, the love of human glory, though it be vain, be not inconsistent
    with charity, neither as regards the matter gloried in, nor as to the
    intention of him that seeks glory, it is not a mortal but a venial sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> No man, by sinning, merits eternal life:
    wherefore a virtuous deed loses its power to merit eternal life, if it be
    done for the sake of vainglory, even though that vainglory be not a mortal
    sin. On the other hand when a man loses the eternal reward simply through
    vainglory, and not merely in respect of one act, vainglory is a mortal
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Not every man that is desirous of
    vainglory, desires the excellence which belongs to God alone. For the glory
    due to God alone differs from the glory due to a virtuous or rich man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Vainglory is stated to be a dangerous
    sin, not only on account of its gravity, but also because it is a
    disposition to grave sins, in so far as it renders man presumptuous and too
    self-confident: and so it gradually disposes a man to lose his inward
    goods.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether vainglory is a capital vice?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that vainglory is not a capital vice.
    For a vice that always arises from another vice is seemingly not capital.
    But vainglory always arises from pride. Therefore vainglory is not a capital
    vice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, honor would seem to take precedence of
    glory, for this is its effect. Now ambition which is inordinate desire of
    honor is not a capital vice. Neither therefore is the desire of
    vainglory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a capital vice has a certain prominence.
    But vainglory seems to have no prominence, neither as a sin, because it is
    not always a mortal sin, nor considered as an appetible good, since human
    glory is apparently a frail thing, and is something outside man himself.
    Therefore vainglory is not a capital vice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi) numbers vainglory among
    the seven capital vices.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The capital vices are enumerated in two ways.
    For some reckon pride as one of their number: and these do not place
    vainglory among the capital vices. Gregory, however (Moral. xxxi), reckons
    pride to be the queen of all the vices, and vainglory, which is the
    immediate offspring of pride, he reckons to be a capital vice: and not
    without reason. For pride, as we shall state farther on (<a
      href="SS152.html#SSQ152OUTP1"
      >Question [152]</a
    >, <a href="SS152.html#SSQ152ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), denotes inordinate
    desire of excellence. But whatever good one may desire, one desires a
    certain perfection and excellence therefrom: wherefore the end of every vice
    is directed to the end of pride, so that this vice seems to exercise a kind
    of causality over the other vices, and ought not to be reckoned among the
    special sources of vice, known as the capital vices. Now among the goods
    that are the means whereby man acquires honor, glory seems to be the most
    conducive to that effect, inasmuch as it denotes the manifestation of a
    man's goodness: since good is naturally loved and honored by all. Wherefore,
    just as by the glory which is in God's sight man acquires honor in Divine
    things, so too by the glory which is in the sight of man he acquires
    excellence in human things. Hence on account of its close connection with
    excellence, which men desire above all, it follows that it is most
    desirable. And since many vices arise from the inordinate desire thereof, it
    follows that vainglory is a capital vice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is not impossible for a capital vice
    to arise from pride, since as stated above (in the body of the
    <a href="SS132.html#SSQ132ATHEP1">Article and FS, Question [84]</a>,
    <a href="SS132.html#SSQ132Articles2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) pride is the
    queen and mother of all the vices.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Praise and honor, as stated above (<a
      href="SS132.html#SSQ132A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), stand in relation to glory as the causes from which it proceeds, so that
    glory is compared to them as their end. For the reason why a man loves to be
    honored and praised is that he thinks thereby to acquire a certain renown in
    the knowledge of others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Vainglory stands prominent under the
    aspect of desirability, for the reason given above, and this suffices for it
    to be reckoned a capital vice. Nor is it always necessary for a capital vice
    to be a mortal sin; for mortal sin can arise from venial sin, inasmuch as
    venial sin can dispose man thereto.

    Whether the daughters of vainglory are suitably reckoned to be disobedience,
    boastfulness, hypocrisy, contention, obstinacy, discord, and love of
    novelties?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the daughters of vainglory are
    unsuitably reckoned to be "disobedience, boastfulness, hypocrisy,
    contention, obstinacy, discord, and eccentricity [*Praesumptio novitatum,
    literally 'presumption of novelties']." For according to Gregory (Moral.
    xxiii) boastfulness is numbered among the species of pride. Now pride does
    not arise from vainglory, rather is it the other way about, as Gregory says
    (Moral. xxxi). Therefore boastfulness should not be reckoned among the
    daughters of vainglory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, contention and discord seem to be the
    outcome chiefly of anger. But anger is a capital vice condivided with
    vainglory. Therefore it seems that they are not the daughters of
    vainglory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Chrysostom says (Hom. xix in Matth.)
    that vainglory is always evil, but especially in philanthropy, i.e. mercy.
    And yet this is nothing new, for it is an established custom among men.
    Therefore eccentricity should not be specially reckoned as a daughter of
    vainglory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the authority of Gregory (Moral.
    xxxi), who there assigns the above daughters to vainglory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/summa/SS/SS034.html#SSQ34OUTP1"
      >Question [34]</a
    >,
    <a

    >;

      >Question [35]</a
    >,
    <a
      href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/summa/SS/SS035.html#SSQ35A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >; <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), the vices which
    by their very nature are such as to be directed to the end of a certain
    capital vice, are called its daughters. Now the end of vainglory is the
    manifestation of one's own excellence, as stated above (<a
      href="SS132.html#SSQ132ATHEP1"
      >Articles [1]</a
    >,4): and to this end a man may tend in two ways. In one way directly,
    either by words, and this is boasting, or by deeds, and then if they be true
    and call for astonishment, it is love of novelties which men are wont to
    wonder at most; but if they be false, it is hypocrisy. In another way a man
    strives to make known his excellence by showing that he is not inferior to
    another, and this in four ways. First, as regards the intellect, and thus we
    have "obstinacy," by which a man is too much attached to his own opinion,
    being unwilling to believe one that is better. Secondly, as regards the
    will, and then we have "discord," whereby a man is unwilling to give up his
    own will, and agree with others. Thirdly, as regards "speech," and then we
    have "contention," whereby a man quarrels noisily with another. Fourthly as
    regards deeds, and this is "disobedience," whereby a man refuses to carry
    out the command of his superiors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS112.html#SSQ112OUTP1"
      >Question [112]</a
    >, <a href="SS112.html#SSQ112A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), boasting is
    reckoned a kind of pride, as regards its interior cause, which is arrogance:
    but outward boasting, according to Ethic. iv, is directed sometimes to gain,
    but more often to glory and honor, and thus it is the result of
    vainglory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Anger is not the cause of discord and
    contention, except in conjunction with vainglory, in that a man thinks it a
    glorious thing for him not to yield to the will and words of others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Vainglory is reproved in connection with
    almsdeeds on account of the lack of charity apparent in one who prefers
    vainglory to the good of his neighbor, seeing that he does the latter for
    the sake of the former. But a man is not reproved for presuming to give alms
    as though this were something novel.<br />
