  <h3 align="center">OF CLEMENCY AND MEEKNESS (FOUR ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must next consider clemency and meekness, and the contrary vices.
    Concerning the virtues themselves there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS157.html#SSQ157A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether clemency and meekness are
    altogether identical?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS157.html#SSQ157A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether each of them is a virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS157.html#SSQ157A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether each is a part of
    temperance?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS157.html#SSQ157A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of their comparison with the
    other virtues.

    Whether clemency and meekness are absolutely the same?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that clemency and meekness are
    absolutely the same. For meekness moderates anger, according to the
    Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 5). Now anger is "desire of vengeance" [*Aristotle,
    Rhet. ii, 2]. Since, then, clemency "is leniency of a superior in inflicting
    punishment on an inferior," as Seneca states (De Clementia ii, 3), and
    vengeance is taken by means of punishment, it would seem that clemency and
    meekness are the same.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54)
    that "clemency is a virtue whereby the mind is restrained by kindness when
    unreasonably provoked to hatred of a person," so that apparently clemency
    moderates hatred. Now, according to Augustine [*Ep. ccxi], hatred is caused
    by anger; and this is the matter of meekness and clemency. Therefore
    seemingly clemency and meekness are absolutely the same.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same vice is not opposed to
    different virtues. But the same vice, namely cruelty, is opposed to meekness
    and clemency. Therefore it seems that meekness and clemency are absolutely
    the same.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> According to the aforesaid definition of
    Seneca (Objection [1]) "clemency is leniency of a superior towards an
    inferior": whereas meekness is not merely of superior to inferior, but of
    each to everyone. Therefore meekness and clemency are not absolutely the
    same.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated in Ethic. ii, 3, a moral virtue is
    "about passions and actions." Now internal passions are principles of
    external actions, and are likewise obstacles thereto. Wherefore virtues that
    moderate passions, to a certain extent, concur towards the same effect as
    virtues that moderate actions, although they differ specifically. Thus it
    belongs properly to justice to restrain man from theft, whereunto he is
    inclined by immoderate love or desire of money, which is restrained by
    liberality; so that liberality concurs with justice towards the effect,
    which is abstention from theft. This applies to the case in point; because
    through the passion of anger a man is provoked to inflict a too severe
    punishment, while it belongs directly to clemency to mitigate punishment,
    and this might be prevented by excessive anger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Consequently meekness, in so far as it restrains the onslaught of anger,
    concurs with clemency towards the same effect; yet they differ from one
    another, inasmuch as clemency moderates external punishment, while meekness
    properly mitigates the passion of anger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Meekness regards properly the desire
    itself of vengeance; whereas clemency regards the punishment itself which is
    applied externally for the purpose of vengeance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man's affections incline to the
    moderation of things that are unpleasant to him in themselves. Now it
    results from one man loving another that he takes no pleasure in the
    latter's punishment in itself, but only as directed to something else, for
    instance justice, or the correction of the person punished. Hence love makes
    one quick to mitigate punishment ---and this pertains to clemency---while
    hatred is an obstacle to such mitigation. For this reason Tully says that
    "the mind provoked to hatred" that is to punish too severely, "is restrained
    by clemency," from inflicting too severe a punishment, so that clemency
    directly moderates not hatred but punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The vice of anger, which denotes excess
    in the passion of anger, is properly opposed to meekness, which is directly
    concerned with the passion of anger; while cruelty denotes excess in
    punishing. Wherefore Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 4) that "those are called
    cruel who have reason for punishing, but lack moderation in punishing."
    Those who delight in a man's punishment for its own sake may be called
    savage or brutal, as though lacking the human feeling that leads one man to
    love another.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether both clemency and meekness are virtues?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that neither clemency nor meekness
    is a virtue. For no virtue is opposed to another virtue. Yet both of these
    are apparently opposed to severity, which is a virtue. Therefore neither
    clemency nor meekness is a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "Virtue is destroyed by excess and
    defect" [*Ethic. ii, 2]. But both clemency and meekness consist in a certain
    decrease; for clemency decreases punishment, and meekness decreases anger.
    Therefore neither clemency nor meekness is a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, meekness or mildness is included (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++5%3A4"
      >Mt. 5:4</a
    >) among the beatitudes, and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A23"
      >Gal. 5:23</a
    >) among the fruits. Now the virtues differ from the beatitudes and fruits.
    Therefore they are not comprised under virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 5): "Every good
    man is conspicuous for his clemency and meekness." Now it is virtue properly
    that belongs to a good man, since "virtue it is that makes its possessor
    good, and renders his works good also" (Ethic. ii, 6). Therefore clemency
    and meekness are virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The nature of moral virtue consists in the
    subjection of appetite to reason, as the Philosopher declares (Ethic. i,
    13). Now this is verified both in clemency and in meekness. For clemency, in
    mitigating punishment, "is guided by reason," according to Seneca (De
    Clementia ii, 5), and meekness, likewise, moderates anger according to right
    reason, as stated in Ethic. iv, 5. Wherefore it is manifest that both
    clemency and meekness are virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Meekness is not directly opposed to
    severity; for meekness is about anger. On the other hand, severity regards
    the external infliction of punishment, so that accordingly it would seem
    rather to be opposed to clemency, which also regards external punishing, as
    stated above (<a href="SS157.html#SSQ157A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Yet they
    are not really opposed to one another, since they are both according to
    right reason. For severity is inflexible in the infliction of punishment
    when right reason requires it; while clemency mitigates punishment also
    according to right reason, when and where this is requisite. Wherefore they
    are not opposed to one another as they are not about the same thing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv,
    5), "the habit that observes the mean in anger is unnamed; so that the
    virtue is denominated from the diminution of anger, and is designated by the
    name of meekness." For the virtue is more akin to diminution than to excess,
    because it is more natural to man to desire vengeance for injuries done to
    him, than to be lacking in that desire, since "scarcely anyone belittles an
    injury done to himself," as Sallust observes [*Cf. Question [120]]. As to
    clemency, it mitigates punishment, not in respect of that which is according
    to right reason, but as regards that which is according to common law, which
    is the object of legal justice: yet on account of some particular
    consideration, it mitigates the punishment, deciding, as it were, that a man
    is not to be punished any further. Hence Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 1):
    "Clemency grants this, in the first place, that those whom she sets free are
    declared immune from all further punishment; and remission of punishment due
    amounts to a pardon." Wherefore it is clear that clemency is related to
    severity as equity [the Greek 'epieikeia' [*Cf. Question [120]]] to legal
    justice, whereof severity is a part, as regards the infliction of punishment
    in accordance with the law. Yet clemency differs from equity, as we shall
    state further on (<a href="SS157.html#SSQ157A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad
    1).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The beatitudes are acts of virtue: while
    the fruits are delights in virtuous acts. Wherefore nothing hinders meekness
    being reckoned both virtue, and beatitude and fruit.<br />

    Whether the aforesaid virtues are parts of temperance?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the aforesaid virtues are not
    parts of temperance. For clemency mitigates punishment, as stated above (<a
      href="SS157.html#SSQ157A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). But the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 10) ascribes this to equity, which
    pertains to justice, as stated above (<a href="SS120.html#SSQ120OUTP1"
      >Question [120]</a
    >, <a href="SS120.html#SSQ120A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore seemingly
    clemency is not a part of temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, temperance is concerned with
    concupiscences; whereas meekness and clemency regard, not concupiscences,
    but anger and vengeance. Therefore they should not be reckoned parts of
    temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 4): "A man
    may be said to be of unsound mind when he takes pleasure in cruelty." Now
    this is opposed to clemency and meekness. Since then an unsound mind is
    opposed to prudence, it seems that clemency and meekness are parts of
    prudence rather than of temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 3) that
    "clemency is temperance of the soul in exercising the power of taking
    revenge." Tully also (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) reckons clemency a part of
    temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Parts are assigned to the principal virtues, in
    so far as they imitate them in some secondary matter as to the mode whence
    the virtue derives its praise and likewise its name. Thus the mode and name
    of justice consist in a certain "equality," those of fortitude in a certain
    "strength of mind," those of temperance in a certain "restraint," inasmuch
    as it restrains the most vehement concupiscences of the pleasures of touch.
    Now clemency and meekness likewise consist in a certain restraint, since
    clemency mitigates punishment, while meekness represses anger, as stated
    above (<a href="SS157.html#SSQ157ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Therefore both
    clemency and meekness are annexed to temperance as principal virtue, and
    accordingly are reckoned to be parts thereof.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Two points must be considered in the
    mitigation of punishment. one is that punishment should be mitigated in
    accordance with the lawgiver's intention, although not according to the
    letter of the law; and in this respect it pertains to equity. The other
    point is a certain moderation of a man's inward disposition, so that he does
    not exercise his power of inflicting punishment. This belongs properly to
    clemency, wherefore Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 3) that "it is temperance
    of the soul in exercising the power of taking revenge." This moderation of
    soul comes from a certain sweetness of disposition, whereby a man recoils
    from anything that may be painful to another. Wherefore Seneca says (De
    Clementia ii, 3) that "clemency is a certain smoothness of the soul"; for,
    on the other hand, there would seem to be a certain roughness of soul in one
    who fears not to pain others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The annexation of secondary to principal
    virtues depends on the mode of virtue, which is, so to speak, a kind of form
    of the virtue, rather than on the matter. Now meekness and clemency agree
    with temperance in mode, as stated above, though they agree not in
    matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> "Unsoundness" is corruption of
    "soundness." Now just as soundness of body is corrupted by the body lapsing
    from the condition due to the human species, so unsoundness of mind is due
    to the mind lapsing from the disposition due to the human species. This
    occurs both in respect of the reason, as when a man loses the use of reason,
    and in respect of the appetitive power, as when a man loses that humane
    feeling whereby "every man is naturally friendly towards all other men"
    (Ethic. viii, 1). The unsoundness of mind that excludes the use of reason is
    opposed to prudence. But that a man who takes pleasure in the punishment of
    others is said to be of unsound mind, is because he seems on this account to
    be devoid of the humane feeling which gives rise to clemency.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether clemency and meekness are the greatest virtues?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that clemency and meekness are the
    greatest virtues. For virtue is deserving of praise chiefly because it
    directs man to happiness that consists in the knowledge of God. Now meekness
    above all directs man to the knowledge of God: for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+1%3A21"
      >James 1:21</a
    >): "With meekness receive the ingrafted word," and (Ecclus. 5:13): "Be meek
    to hear the word" of God. Again, Dionysius says (Ep. viii ad Demophil.) that
    "Moses was deemed worthy of the Divine apparition on account of his great
    meekness." Therefore meekness is the greatest of virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, seemingly a virtue is all the greater
    according as it is more acceptable to God and men. Now meekness would appear
    to be most acceptable to God. For it is written (Ecclus. 1:34,35): "That
    which is agreeable" to God is "faith and meekness"; wherefore Christ
    expressly invites us to be meek like unto Himself (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++11%3A29"
      >Mt. 11:29</a
    >), where He says: "Learn of Me, because I am meek and humble of heart"; and
    Hilary declares [*Comment. in Matth. iv, 3] that "Christ dwells in us by our
    meekness of soul." Again, it is most acceptable to men; wherefore it is
    written (Ecclus. 3:19): "My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be
    beloved above the glory of men": for which reason it is also declared (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++20%3A28"
      >Prov. 20:28</a
    >) that the King's "throne is strengthened by clemency." Therefore meekness
    and clemency are the greatest of virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte
    i, 2) that "the meek are they who yield to reproaches, and resist not evil,
    but overcome evil by good." Now this seems to pertain to mercy or piety
    which would seem to be the greatest of virtues: because a gloss of Ambrose
    [*Hilary the deacon] on 1 Tim. 4:8, "Piety [Douay: 'Godliness'] is
    profitable to all things," observes that "piety is the sum total of the
    Christian religion." Therefore meekness and clemency are the greatest
    virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> They are not reckoned as principal virtues,
    but are annexed to another, as to a principal, virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Nothing prevents certain virtues from being
    greatest, not indeed simply, nor in every respect, but in a particular
    genus. It is impossible for clemency or meekness to be absolutely the
    greatest virtues, since they owe their praise to the fact that they withdraw
    a man from evil, by mitigating anger or punishment. Now it is more perfect
    to obtain good than to lack evil. Wherefore those virtues like faith, hope,
    charity, and likewise prudence and justice, which direct one to good simply,
    are absolutely greater virtues than clemency and meekness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet nothing prevents clemency and meekness from having a certain restricted
    excellence among the virtues which resist evil inclinations. For anger,
    which is mitigated by meekness, is, on account of its impetuousness, a very
    great obstacle to man's free judgment of truth: wherefore meekness above all
    makes a man self-possessed. Hence it is written (Ecclus. 10:31): "My son,
    keep thy soul in meekness." Yet the concupiscences of the pleasures of touch
    are more shameful, and harass more incessantly, for which reason temperance
    is more rightly reckoned as a principal virtue, as stated above (<a
      href="SS141.html#SSQ141OUTP1"
      >Question [141]</a
    >, <a href="SS141.html#SSQ141A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>, ad 2). As to
    clemency, inasmuch as it mitigates punishment, it would seem to approach
    nearest to charity, the greatest of the virtues, since thereby we do good
    towards our neighbor, and hinder his evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Meekness disposes man to the knowledge
    of God, by removing an obstacle; and this in two ways. First, because it
    makes man self-possessed by mitigating his anger, as stated above; secondly,
    because it pertains to meekness that a man does not contradict the words of
    truth, which many do through being disturbed by anger. Wherefore Augustine
    says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 7): "To be meek is not to contradict Holy Writ,
    whether we understand it, if it condemn our evil ways, or understand it not,
    as though we might know better and have a clearer insight of the truth."<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Meekness and clemency make us acceptable
    to God and men, in so far as they concur with charity, the greatest of the
    virtues, towards the same effect, namely the mitigation of our neighbor's
    evils.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Mercy and piety agree indeed with
    meekness and clemency by concurring towards the same effect, namely the
    mitigation of our neighbor's evils. Nevertheless they differ as to motive.
    For piety relieves a neighbor's evil through reverence for a superior, for
    instance God or one's parents: mercy relieves a neighbor's evil, because
    this evil is displeasing to one, in so far as one looks upon it as affecting
    oneself, as stated above (<a href="SS030.html#SSQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>,
    <a href="SS030.html#SSQ30A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>): and this results from
    friendship which makes friends rejoice and grieve for the same things:
    meekness does this, by removing anger that urges to vengeance, and clemency
    does this through leniency of soul, in so far as it judges equitable that a
    person be no further punished.<br />
