<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must next consider clemency and meekness, and the contrary vices. 
Concerning the virtues themselves there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether clemency and meekness are altogether identical?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether each of them is a virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether each is a part of temperance?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of their comparison with the other virtues.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether clemency and meekness are absolutely the same?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that clemency and meekness are absolutely the same. 
For meekness moderates anger, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 
5). Now anger is "desire of vengeance" [*Aristotle, Rhet. ii, 2]. Since, 
then, clemency "is leniency of a superior in inflicting punishment on an 
inferior," as Seneca states (De Clementia ii, 3), and vengeance is taken 
by means of punishment, it would seem that clemency and meekness are the 
same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) that "clemency is a 
virtue whereby the mind is restrained by kindness when unreasonably 
provoked to hatred of a person," so that apparently clemency moderates 
hatred. Now, according to Augustine [*Ep. ccxi], hatred is caused by 
anger; and this is the matter of meekness and clemency. Therefore 
seemingly clemency and meekness are absolutely the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same vice is not opposed to different virtues. But 
the same vice, namely cruelty, is opposed to meekness and clemency. 
Therefore it seems that meekness and clemency are  absolutely the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> According to the aforesaid definition of Seneca (Objection [1]
) "clemency is leniency of a superior towards an inferior": whereas 
meekness is not merely of superior to inferior, but of each to everyone. 
Therefore meekness and clemency are not absolutely the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated in Ethic. ii, 3, a moral virtue is "about 
passions and actions." Now internal passions are principles of external 
actions, and are likewise obstacles thereto. Wherefore virtues that 
moderate passions, to a certain extent, concur towards the same effect as 
virtues that moderate actions, although they differ specifically. Thus it 
belongs properly to justice to restrain man from theft, whereunto he is 
inclined by immoderate love or desire of money, which is restrained by 
liberality; so that liberality concurs with justice towards the effect, 
which is abstention from theft. This applies to the case in point; 
because through the passion of anger a man is provoked to inflict a too 
severe punishment, while it belongs directly to clemency to mitigate 
punishment, and this might be prevented by excessive anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently meekness, in so far as it restrains the onslaught of anger, 
concurs with clemency towards the same effect; yet they differ from one 
another, inasmuch as clemency moderates external punishment, while 
meekness properly mitigates the passion of anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Meekness regards properly the desire itself of vengeance; 
whereas clemency regards the punishment itself which is applied 
externally for the purpose of vengeance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man's affections incline to the moderation of things that 
are unpleasant to him in themselves. Now it results from one man loving 
another that he takes no pleasure in the latter's punishment in itself, 
but only as directed to something else, for instance justice, or the 
correction of the person punished. Hence love makes one quick to mitigate 
punishment ---and this pertains to clemency---while hatred is an obstacle 
to such mitigation. For this reason Tully says that "the mind provoked to 
hatred" that is to punish too severely, "is restrained by clemency," from 
inflicting too severe a punishment, so that clemency directly moderates 
not hatred but punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The vice of anger, which denotes excess in the passion of 
anger, is properly opposed to meekness, which is directly concerned with 
the passion of anger; while cruelty denotes excess in punishing. 
Wherefore Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 4) that "those are called cruel 
who have reason for punishing, but lack moderation in punishing." Those 
who delight in a man's punishment for its own sake may be called savage 
or brutal, as though lacking the human feeling that leads one man to love 
another.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether both clemency and meekness are virtues?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that neither clemency nor meekness is a virtue. For 
no virtue is opposed to another virtue. Yet both of these are apparently 
opposed to severity, which is a virtue. Therefore neither clemency nor 
meekness is a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "Virtue is destroyed by excess and defect" [*Ethic. ii, 
2]. But both clemency and meekness consist in a certain decrease; for 
clemency decreases punishment, and meekness decreases anger. Therefore 
neither clemency nor meekness is a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, meekness or mildness is included (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++5:4">Mt. 5:4</a>) among the 
beatitudes, and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++5:23">Gal. 5:23</a>) among the fruits. Now the virtues differ from 
the beatitudes and fruits. Therefore they are not comprised under virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 5): "Every good man is 
conspicuous for his clemency and meekness." Now it is virtue properly 
that belongs to a good man, since "virtue it is that makes its possessor 
good, and renders his works good also" (Ethic. ii, 6). Therefore clemency 
and meekness are virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The nature of moral virtue consists in the subjection of 
appetite to reason, as the Philosopher declares (Ethic. i, 13). Now this 
is verified both in clemency and in meekness. For clemency, in mitigating 
punishment, "is guided by reason," according to Seneca (De Clementia ii, 
5), and meekness, likewise, moderates anger according to right reason, as 
stated in Ethic. iv, 5. Wherefore it is manifest that both clemency and 
meekness are virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Meekness is not directly opposed to severity; for meekness 
is about anger. On the other hand, severity regards the external 
infliction of punishment, so that accordingly it would seem rather to be 
opposed to clemency, which also regards external punishing, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Yet they are not really opposed to one another, since they 
are both according to right reason. For severity is inflexible in the 
infliction of punishment when right reason requires it; while clemency 
mitigates punishment also according to right reason, when and where this 
is requisite. Wherefore they are not opposed to one another as they are 
not about the same thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 5), "the habit 
that observes the mean in anger is unnamed; so that the virtue is 
denominated from the diminution of anger, and is designated by the name 
of meekness." For the virtue is more akin to diminution than to excess, 
because it is more natural to man to desire vengeance for injuries done 
to him, than to be lacking in that desire, since "scarcely anyone 
belittles an injury done to himself," as Sallust observes [*Cf. Question [120]]. 
As to clemency, it  mitigates punishment, not in respect of that which is 
according to right reason, but as regards that which is according to 
common law, which is the object of legal justice: yet on account of some 
particular consideration, it mitigates the punishment, deciding, as it 
were, that a man is not to be punished any further. Hence Seneca says (De 
Clementia ii, 1): "Clemency grants this, in the first place, that those 
whom she sets free are declared immune from all further punishment; and 
remission of punishment due amounts to a pardon." Wherefore it is clear 
that clemency is related to severity as equity [the Greek 'epieikeia' 
[*Cf. Question [120]]] to legal justice, whereof severity is a part, as regards 
the infliction of punishment in accordance with the law. Yet clemency 
differs from equity, as we shall state further on (<A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The beatitudes are acts of virtue: while the fruits are 
delights in virtuous acts. Wherefore nothing hinders meekness being 
reckoned both virtue, and beatitude and fruit.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the aforesaid virtues are parts of temperance?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the aforesaid virtues are not parts of 
temperance. For clemency mitigates punishment, as stated above (<A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). 
But the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 10) ascribes this to equity, which 
pertains to justice, as stated above (<A Href="SS120.html#SSQ120OUTP1">Question [120]</a>, <A Href="SS120.html#SSQ120A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore seemingly 
clemency is not a part of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, temperance is concerned with concupiscences; whereas 
meekness and clemency regard, not concupiscences, but anger and 
vengeance. Therefore they should not be reckoned parts of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 4): "A man may be said to 
be of unsound mind when he takes pleasure in cruelty." Now this is 
opposed to clemency and meekness. Since then an unsound mind is opposed 
to prudence, it seems that clemency and meekness are parts of prudence 
rather than of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 3) that "clemency is 
temperance of the soul in exercising the power of taking revenge." Tully 
also (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) reckons clemency a part of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Parts are assigned to the principal virtues, in so far as 
they imitate them in some secondary matter as to the mode whence the 
virtue derives its praise and likewise its name. Thus the mode and name 
of justice consist in a certain "equality," those of fortitude in a 
certain "strength of mind," those of temperance in a certain "restraint," 
inasmuch as it restrains the most vehement concupiscences of the 
pleasures of touch. Now clemency and meekness likewise consist in a 
certain restraint, since clemency mitigates punishment, while meekness 
represses anger, as stated above (<A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2). Therefore both clemency and 
meekness are annexed to temperance as principal virtue, and accordingly 
are reckoned to be  parts thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Two points must be considered in the mitigation of 
punishment. one is that punishment should be mitigated in accordance with 
the lawgiver's intention, although not according to the letter of the 
law; and in this respect it pertains to equity. The other point is a 
certain moderation of a man's inward disposition, so that he does not 
exercise his power of inflicting punishment. This belongs properly to 
clemency, wherefore Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 3) that "it is 
temperance of the soul in exercising the power of taking revenge." This 
moderation of soul comes from a certain sweetness of disposition, whereby 
a man recoils from anything that may be painful to another. Wherefore 
Seneca says (De Clementia ii, 3) that "clemency is a certain smoothness 
of the soul"; for, on the other hand, there would seem to be a certain 
roughness of soul in one who fears not to pain others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The annexation of secondary to principal virtues depends on 
the mode of virtue, which is, so to speak, a kind of form of the virtue, 
rather than on the matter. Now meekness and clemency agree with 
temperance in mode, as stated above, though they agree not in matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> "Unsoundness" is corruption of "soundness." Now just as 
soundness of body is corrupted by the body lapsing from the condition due 
to the human species, so unsoundness of mind is due to the mind lapsing 
from the disposition due to the human species. This occurs both in 
respect of the reason, as when a man loses the use of reason, and in 
respect of the appetitive power, as when a man loses that humane feeling 
whereby "every man is naturally friendly towards all other men" (Ethic. 
viii, 1). The unsoundness of mind that excludes the use of reason is 
opposed to prudence. But that a man who takes pleasure in the punishment 
of others is said to be of unsound mind, is because he seems on this 
account to be devoid of the humane feeling which gives rise to clemency.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether clemency and meekness are the greatest virtues?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that clemency and meekness are the greatest 
virtues. For virtue is deserving of praise chiefly because it directs man 
to happiness that consists in the knowledge of God. Now meekness above 
all directs man to the knowledge of God: for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+1:21">James 1:21</a>): 
"With meekness receive the ingrafted word," and (Ecclus. 5:13): "Be meek 
to hear the word" of God. Again, Dionysius says (Ep. viii ad Demophil.) 
that "Moses was deemed worthy of the Divine apparition on account of his 
great meekness." Therefore meekness is the greatest of virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, seemingly a virtue is all the greater according as it is 
more acceptable to God and men. Now meekness would appear to be most 
acceptable to God. For it is written (Ecclus. 1:34,35): "That which is 
agreeable" to God is "faith and  meekness"; wherefore Christ expressly 
invites us to be meek like unto Himself (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++11:29">Mt. 11:29</a>), where He says: 
"Learn of Me, because I am meek and humble of heart"; and Hilary declares 
[*Comment. in Matth. iv, 3] that "Christ dwells in us by our meekness of 
soul." Again, it is most acceptable to men; wherefore it is written 
(Ecclus. 3:19): "My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be 
beloved above the glory of men": for which reason it is also declared 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++20:28">Prov. 20:28</a>) that the King's "throne is strengthened by clemency." 
Therefore meekness and clemency are the greatest of virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 2) that "the 
meek are they who yield to reproaches, and resist not evil, but overcome 
evil by good." Now this seems to pertain to mercy or piety which would 
seem to be the greatest of virtues: because a gloss of Ambrose [*Hilary 
the deacon] on 1 Tim. 4:8, "Piety [Douay: 'Godliness'] is profitable to 
all things," observes that "piety is the sum total of the Christian 
religion." Therefore meekness and clemency are the greatest virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> They are not reckoned as principal virtues, but are 
annexed to another, as to a principal, virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Nothing prevents certain virtues from being greatest, not 
indeed simply, nor in every respect, but in a particular genus. It is 
impossible for clemency or meekness to be absolutely the greatest 
virtues, since they owe their praise to the fact that they withdraw a man 
from evil, by mitigating anger or punishment. Now it is more perfect to 
obtain good than to lack evil. Wherefore those virtues like faith, hope, 
charity, and likewise prudence and justice, which direct one to good 
simply, are absolutely greater virtues than clemency and meekness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet nothing prevents clemency and meekness from having a certain 
restricted excellence among the virtues which resist evil inclinations. 
For anger, which is mitigated by meekness, is, on account of its 
impetuousness, a very great obstacle to man's free judgment of truth: 
wherefore meekness above all makes a man self-possessed. Hence it is 
written (Ecclus. 10:31): "My son, keep thy soul in meekness." Yet the 
concupiscences of the pleasures of touch are more shameful, and harass 
more incessantly, for which reason temperance is more rightly reckoned as 
a principal virtue. as stated above (<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141OUTP1">Question [141]</a>, <A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>, ad 2). As to clemency, 
inasmuch as it mitigates punishment, it would seem to approach nearest to 
charity, the greatest of the virtues, since thereby we do good towards 
our neighbor, and hinder his evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Meekness disposes man to the knowledge of God, by removing 
an obstacle; and this in two ways. First, because it makes man 
self-possessed by mitigating his anger, as stated above; secondly, 
because it pertains to meekness that a man does not contradict the words 
of truth, which many do through being disturbed by anger. Wherefore 
Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 7): "To be meek is not to 
contradict Holy Writ, whether we understand it, if it condemn our evil 
ways, or understand it not,  as though we might know better and have a 
clearer insight of the truth."<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Meekness and clemency make us acceptable to God and men, in 
so far as they concur with charity, the greatest of the virtues, towards 
the same effect, namely the mitigation of our neighbor's evils.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[157] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Mercy and piety agree indeed with meekness and clemency by 
concurring towards the same effect, namely the mitigation of our 
neighbor's evils. Nevertheless they differ as to motive. For piety 
relieves a neighbor's evil through reverence for a superior, for instance 
God or one's parents: mercy relieves a neighbor's evil, because this evil 
is displeasing to one, in so far as one looks upon it as affecting 
oneself, as stated above (<A Href="SS030.html#SSQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>, <A Href="SS030.html#SSQ30A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>): and this results from friendship 
which makes friends rejoice and grieve for the same things: meekness does 
this, by removing anger that urges to vengeance, and clemency does this 
through leniency of soul, in so far as it judges equitable that a person 
be no further punished.<br>
