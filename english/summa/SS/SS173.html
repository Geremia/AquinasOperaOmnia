    OF THE MANNER IN WHICH PROPHETIC KNOWLEDGE IS CONVEYED (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the manner in which prophetic knowledge is conveyed,
    and under this head there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS173.html#SSQ173A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the prophets see God's
    very essence?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS173.html#SSQ173A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the prophetic revelation
    is effected by the infusion of certain species, or by the infusion of Divine
    light alone?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS173.html#SSQ173A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether prophetic revelation is
    always accompanied by abstraction from the sense?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS173.html#SSQ173A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether prophecy is always
    accompanied by knowledge of the things prophesied?<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether the prophets see the very essence of God?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the prophets see the very
    essence of God, for a gloss on Is. 38:1, "Take order with thy house, for
    thou shalt die and not live," says: "Prophets can read in the book of God's
    foreknowledge in which all things are written." Now God's foreknowledge is
    His very essence. Therefore prophets see God's very essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. ix, 7) that "in
    that eternal truth from which all temporal things are made, we see with the
    mind's eye the type both of our being and of our actions." Now, of all men,
    prophets have the highest knowledge of Divine things. Therefore they,
    especially, see the Divine essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, future contingencies are foreknown by
    the prophets "with unchangeable truth." Now future contingencies exist thus
    in God alone. Therefore the prophets see God Himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The vision of the Divine essence is not made
    void in heaven; whereas "prophecy is made void" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++13%3A8"
      >1 Cor. 13:8</a
    >). Therefore prophecy is not conveyed by a vision of the Divine essence.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Prophecy denotes Divine knowledge as existing
    afar off. Wherefore it is said of the prophets (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A13"
      >Heb. 11:13</a
    >) that "they were beholding... afar off." But those who are in heaven and
    in the state of bliss see, not as from afar off, but rather, as it were,
    from near at hand, according to Ps. 139:14, "The upright shall dwell with
    Thy countenance." Hence it is evident that prophetic knowledge differs from
    the perfect knowledge, which we shall have in heaven, so that it is
    distinguished therefrom as the imperfect from the perfect, and when the
    latter comes the former is made void, as appears from the words of the
    Apostle (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++13%3A10"
      >1 Cor. 13:10</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Some, however, wishing to discriminate between prophetic knowledge and the
    knowledge of the blessed, have maintained that the prophets see the very
    essence of God (which they call the "mirror of eternity") [*Cf. De Veritate,
    xii, 6; Sent. II, D, XI, part 2, art. 2, ad 4], not, however, in the way in
    which it is the object of the blessed, but as containing the types [*Cf. FP,
    Question [15]] of future events. But this is altogether impossible. For God
    is the object of bliss in His very essence, according to the saying of
    Augustine (Confess. v, 4): "Happy whoso knoweth Thee, though he know not
    these," i.e. creatures. Now it is not possible to see the types of creatures
    in the very essence of God without seeing It, both because the Divine
    essence is Itself the type of all things that are made---the ideal type
    adding nothing to the Divine essence save only a relationship to the
    creature---and because knowledge of a thing in itself---and such is the
    knowledge of God as the object of heavenly bliss---precedes knowledge of
    that thing in its relation to something else---and such is the knowledge of
    God as containing the types of things. Consequently it is impossible for
    prophets to see God as containing the types of creatures, and yet not as the
    object of bliss. Therefore we must conclude that the prophetic vision is not
    the vision of the very essence of God, and that the prophets do not see in
    the Divine essence Itself the things they do see, but that they see them in
    certain images, according as they are enlightened by the Divine light.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Wherefore Dionysius (Coel. Hier. iv), in speaking of prophetic visions, says
    that "the wise theologian calls that vision divine which is effected by
    images of things lacking a bodily form through the seer being rapt in divine
    things." And these images illumined by the Divine light have more of the
    nature of a mirror than the Divine essence: since in a mirror images are
    formed from other things, and this cannot be said of God. Yet the prophet's
    mind thus enlightened may be called a mirror, in so far as a likeness of the
    truth of the Divine foreknowledge is formed therein, for which reason it is
    called the "mirror of eternity," as representing God's foreknowledge, for
    God in His eternity sees all things as present before Him, as stated above
    (<a href="SS172.html#SSQ172OUTP1">Question [172]</a>,
    <a href="SS172.html#SSQ172A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The prophets are said to read the book
    of God's foreknowledge, inasmuch as the truth is reflected from God's
    foreknowledge on the prophet's mind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man is said to see in the First Truth
    the type of his existence, in so far as the image of the First Truth shines
    forth on man's mind, so that he is able to know himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> From the very fact that future
    contingencies are in God according to unalterable truth, it follows that God
    can impress a like knowledge on the prophet's mind without the prophet
    seeing God in His essence.<br />

    Whether, in prophetic revelation, new species of things are impressed on the
    prophet's mind, or merely a new light?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in prophetic revelation no new
    species of things are impressed on the prophet's mind, but only a new light.
    For a gloss of Jerome on Amos 1:2 says that "prophets draw comparisons from
    things with which they are conversant." But if prophetic vision were
    effected by means of species newly impressed, the prophet's previous
    experience of things would be inoperative. Therefore no new species are
    impressed on the prophet's soul, but only the prophetic light.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit.
    xii, 9), "it is not imaginative but intellective vision that makes the
    prophet"; wherefore it is declared (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++10%3A1"
      >Dan. 10:1</a
    >) that "there is need of understanding in a vision." Now intellective
    vision, as stated in the same book (Gen. ad lit. xii, 6) is not effected by
    means of images, but by the very truth of things. Therefore it would seem
    that prophetic revelation is not effected by impressing species on the
    soul.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by the gift of prophecy the Holy Ghost
    endows man with something that surpasses the faculty of nature. Now man can
    by his natural faculties form all kinds of species of things. Therefore it
    would seem that in prophetic revelation no new species of things are
    impressed, but merely an intellectual light.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Osee 12:10): "I have
    multiplied" their "visions, and I have used similitudes, by the ministry of
    the prophets." Now multiplicity of visions results, not from a diversity of
    intellectual light, which is common to every prophetic vision, but from a
    diversity of species, whence similitudes also result. Therefore it seems
    that in prophetic revelation new species of things are impressed, and not
    merely an intellectual light.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 9),
    "prophetic knowledge pertains most of all to the intellect." Now two things
    have to be considered in connection with the knowledge possessed by the
    human mind, namely the acceptance or representation of things, and the
    judgment of the things represented. Now things are represented to the human
    mind under the form of species: and according to the order of nature, they
    must be represented first to the senses, secondly to the imagination,
    thirdly to the passive intellect, and these are changed by the species
    derived from the phantasms, which change results from the enlightening
    action of the active intellect. Now in the imagination there are the forms
    of sensible things not only as received from the senses, but also
    transformed in various ways, either on account of some bodily transformation
    (as in the case of people who are asleep or out of their senses), or through
    the coordination of the phantasms, at the command of reason, for the purpose
    of understanding something. For just as the various arrangements of the
    letters of the alphabet convey various ideas to the understanding, so the
    various coordinations of the phantasms produce various intelligible species
    of the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As to the judgment formed by the human mind, it depends on the power of the
    intellectual light.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the gift of prophecy confers on the human mind something which surpasses
    the natural faculty in both these respects, namely as to the judgment which
    depends on the inflow of intellectual light, and as to the acceptance or
    representation of things, which is effected by means of certain species.
    Human teaching may be likened to prophetic revelation in the second of these
    respects, but not in the first. For a man represents certain things to his
    disciple by signs of speech, but he cannot enlighten him inwardly as God
    does.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But it is the first of these two that holds the chief place in prophecy,
    since judgment is the complement of knowledge. Wherefore if certain things
    are divinely represented to any man by means of imaginary likenesses, as
    happened to Pharaoh (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++41%3A1-7"
      >Gn. 41:1-7</a
    >) and to Nabuchodonosor (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++4%3A1-2"
      >Dan. 4:1-2</a
    >), or even by bodily likenesses, as happened to Balthasar (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++5%3A5"
      >Dan. 5:5</a
    >), such a man is not to be considered a prophet, unless his mind be
    enlightened for the purpose of judgment; and such an apparition is something
    imperfect in the genus of prophecy. Wherefore some [*Rabbi Moyses, Doct.
    Perplex. II, xxxvi] have called this "prophetic ecstasy," and such is
    divination by dreams. And yet a man will be a prophet, if his intellect be
    enlightened merely for the purpose of judging of things seen in imagination
    by others, as in the case of Joseph who interpreted Pharaoh's dream. But, as
    Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 9), "especially is he a prophet who excels
    in both respects, so," to wit, "as to see in spirit likenesses significant
    of things corporeal, and understand them by the quickness of his
    intellect."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now sensible forms are divinely presented to the prophet's mind, sometimes
    externally by means of the senses---thus Daniel saw the writing on the wall
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++5%3A25">Dan. 5:25</a
    >)---sometimes by means of imaginary forms, either of exclusively Divine
    origin and not received through the senses (for instance, if images of
    colors were imprinted on the imagination of one blind from birth), or
    divinely coordinated from those derived from the senses---thus Jeremiah saw
    the "boiling caldron... from the face of the north" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++1%3A13"
      >Jer. 1:13</a
    >)---or by the direct impression of intelligible species on the mind, as in
    the case of those who receive infused scientific knowledge or wisdom, such
    as Solomon or the apostles.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But intellectual light is divinely imprinted on the human mind---sometimes
    for the purpose of judging of things seen by others, as in the case of
    Joseph, quoted above, and of the apostles whose understanding our Lord
    opened "that they might understand the scriptures" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++24%3A45"
      >Lk. 24:45</a
    >); and to this pertains the "interpretation of speeches"---sometimes for
    the purpose of judging according to Divine truth, of the things which a man
    apprehends in the ordinary course of nature---sometimes for the purpose of
    discerning truthfully and efficaciously what is to be done, according to Is.
    63:14, "The Spirit of the Lord was their leader."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence it is evident that prophetic revelation is conveyed sometimes by the
    mere infusion of light, sometimes by imprinting species anew, or by a new
    coordination of species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above, sometimes in prophetic
    revelation imaginary species previously derived from the senses are divinely
    coordinated so as to accord with the truth to be revealed, and then previous
    experience is operative in the production of the images, but not when they
    are impressed on the mind wholly from without.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Intellectual vision is not effected by
    means of bodily and individual images, but by an intelligible image. Hence
    Augustine says (De Trin. ix, 11) that "the soul possesses a certain likeness
    of the species known to it." Sometimes this intelligible image is, in
    prophetic revelation, imprinted immediately by God, sometimes it results
    from pictures in the imagination, by the aid of the prophetic light, since a
    deeper truth is gathered from these pictures in the imagination by means of
    the enlightenment of the higher light.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is true that man is able by his
    natural powers to form all kinds of pictures in the imagination, by simply
    considering these pictures, but not so that they be directed to the
    representation of intelligible truths that surpass his intellect, since for
    this purpose he needs the assistance of a supernatural light.<br />

    Whether the prophetic vision is always accompanied by abstraction from the
    senses?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the prophetic vision is always
    accompanied by abstraction from the senses. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Num++12%3A6"
      >Num. 12:6</a
    >): "If there be among you a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a
    vision, or I will speak to him in a dream." Now a gloss says at the
    beginning of the Psalter, "a vision that takes place by dreams and
    apparitions consists of things which seem to be said or done." But when
    things seem to be said or done, which are neither said nor done, there is
    abstraction from the senses. Therefore prophecy is always accompanied by
    abstraction from the senses.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, when one power is very intent on its own
    operation, other powers are drawn away from theirs; thus men who are very
    intent on hearing something fail to see what takes place before them. Now in
    the prophetic vision the intellect is very much uplifted, and intent on its
    act. Therefore it seems that the prophetic vision is always accompanied by
    abstraction from the senses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same thing cannot, at the same time,
    tend in opposite directions. Now in the prophetic vision the mind tends to
    the acceptance of things from above, and consequently it cannot at the same
    time tend to sensible objects. Therefore it would seem necessary for
    prophetic revelation to be always accompanied by abstraction from the
    senses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> On the contrary, It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++14%3A32"
      >1 Cor. 14:32</a
    >): "The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets." Now this were
    impossible if the prophet were not in possession of his faculties, but
    abstracted from his senses. Therefore it would seem that prophetic vision is
    not accompanied by abstraction from the senses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated in the foregoing Article, the
    prophetic revelation takes place in four ways: namely, by the infusion of an
    intelligible light, by the infusion of intelligible species, by impression
    or coordination of pictures in the imagination, and by the outward
    presentation of sensible images. Now it is evident that there is no
    abstraction from the senses, when something is presented to the prophet's
    mind by means of sensible species---whether these be divinely formed for
    this special purpose, as the bush shown to Moses (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++3%3A2"
      >Ex. 3:2</a
    >), and the writing shown to Daniel (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++5:"
      >Dan. 5:</a
    >)---or whether they be produced by other causes; yet so that they are
    ordained by Divine providence to be prophetically significant of something,
    as, for instance, the Church was signified by the ark of Noah.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, abstraction from the external senses is not rendered necessary when
    the prophet's mind is enlightened by an intellectual light, or impressed
    with intelligible species, since in us the perfect judgment of the intellect
    is effected by its turning to sensible objects, which are the first
    principles of our knowledge, as stated in the FP, Question [84], Article
    [6].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    When, however, prophetic revelation is conveyed by images in the
    imagination, abstraction from the senses is necessary lest the things thus
    seen in imagination be taken for objects of external sensation. Yet this
    abstraction from the senses is sometimes complete, so that a man perceives
    nothing with his senses; and sometimes it is incomplete, so that he
    perceives something with his senses, yet does not fully discern the things
    he perceives outwardly from those he sees in imagination. Hence Augustine
    says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 12): "Those images of bodies which are formed in the
    soul are seen just as bodily things themselves are seen by the body, so that
    we see with our eyes one who is present, and at the same time we see with
    the soul one who is absent, as though we saw him with our eyes."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet this abstraction from the senses takes place in the prophets without
    subverting the order of nature, as is the case with those who are possessed
    or out of their senses; but is due to some well-ordered cause. This cause
    may be natural---for instance, sleep---or spiritual---for instance, the
    intenseness of the prophets' contemplation; thus we read of Peter (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+10%3A9"
      >Acts 10:9</a
    >) that while he was praying in the supper-room [*Vulg.: 'the house-top' or
    'upper-chamber'] "he fell into an ecstasy"---or he may be carried away by
    the Divine power, according to the saying of Ezechiel 1:3: "The hand of the
    Lord was upon him."<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The passage quoted refers to prophets in
    whom imaginary pictures were formed or coordinated, either while asleep,
    which is denoted by the word "dream," or while awake, which is signified by
    the word "vision."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When the mind is intent, in its act,
    upon distant things which are far removed from the senses, the intensity of
    its application leads to abstraction from the senses; but when it is intent,
    in its act, upon the coordination of or judgment concerning objects of
    sense, there is no need for abstraction from the senses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The movement of the prophetic mind
    results not from its own power, but from a power acting on it from above.
    Hence there is no abstraction from the senses when the prophet's mind is led
    to judge or coordinate matters relating to objects of sense, but only when
    the mind is raised to the contemplation of certain more lofty things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The spirit of the prophets is said to be
    subject to the prophets as regards the prophetic utterances to which the
    Apostle refers in the words quoted; because, to wit, the prophets in
    declaring what they have seen speak their own mind, and are not thrown off
    their mental balance, like persons who are possessed, as Priscilla and
    Montanus maintained. But as regards the prophetic revelation itself, it
    would be more correct to say that the prophets are subject to the. spirit of
    prophecy, i.e. to the prophetic gift.<br />

    Whether prophets always know the things which they prophesy?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the prophets always know the
    things which they prophesy. For, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 9),
    "those to whom signs were shown in spirit by means of the likenesses of
    bodily things, had not the gift of prophecy, unless the mind was brought
    into action, so that those signs were also understood by them." Now what is
    understood cannot be unknown. Therefore the prophet is not ignorant of what
    he prophesies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the light of prophecy surpasses the
    light of natural reason. Now one who possesses a science by his natural
    light, is not ignorant of his scientific acquirements. Therefore he who
    utters things by the prophetic light cannot ignore them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, prophecy is directed for man's
    enlightenment; wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Pt++1%3A19"
      >2 Pt. 1:19</a
    >): "We have the more firm prophetical word, whereunto you do well to
    attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place." Now nothing can
    enlighten others unless it be lightsome in itself. Therefore it would seem
    that the prophet is first enlightened so as to know what he declares to
    others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++11%3A51"
      >Jn. 11:51</a
    >): "And this he" (Caiphas) "spoke, not of himself, but being the High
    Priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation,"
    etc. Now Caiphas knew this not. Therefore not every prophet knows what he
    prophesies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In prophetic revelation the prophet's mind is
    moved by the Holy Ghost, as an instrument that is deficient in regard to the
    principal agent. Now the prophet's mind is moved not only to apprehend
    something, but also to speak or to do something; sometimes indeed to all
    these three together, sometimes to two, sometimes to one only, and in each
    case there may be a defect in the prophet's knowledge. For when the
    prophet's mind is moved to think or apprehend a thing, sometimes he is led
    merely to apprehend that thing, and sometimes he is further led to know that
    it is divinely revealed to him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, sometimes the prophet's mind is moved to speak something, so that he
    understands what the Holy Ghost means by the words he utters; like David who
    said (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Sam++23%3A2"
      >2 Kgs. 23:2</a
    >): "The Spirit of the Lord hath spoken by me"; while, on the other hand,
    sometimes the person whose mind is moved to utter certain words knows not
    what the Holy Ghost means by them, as was the case with Caiphas (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++11%3A51"
      >Jn. 11:51</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, when the Holy Ghost moves a man's mind to do something, sometimes the
    latter understands the meaning of it, like Jeremias who hid his loin-cloth
    in the Euphrates (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++13%3A1-11"
      >Jer. 13:1-11</a
    >); while sometimes he does not understand it---thus the soldiers, who
    divided Christ's garments, understood not the meaning of what they did.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, when a man knows that he is being moved by the Holy Ghost to
    think something, or signify something by word or deed, this belongs properly
    to prophecy; whereas when he is moved, without his knowing it, this is not
    perfect prophecy, but a prophetic instinct. Nevertheless it must be observed
    that since the prophet's mind is a defective instrument, as stated above,
    even true prophets know not all that the Holy Ghost means by the things they
    see, or speak, or even do.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    And this suffices for the Replies to the Objections, since the arguments
    given at the beginning refer to true prophets whose minds are perfectly
    enlightened from above.<br />
