<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must next consider studiousness and its opposite, curiosity. 
Concerning studiousness there are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS166.html#SSQ166A1THEP1">(1)</a> What is the matter of studiousness?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS166.html#SSQ166A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a part of temperance?

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the proper matter of studiousness is knowledge?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that knowledge is not the proper matter of 
studiousness. For a person is said to be studious because he applies 
study to certain things. Now a man ought to apply study to every matter, 
in order to do aright what has to be done. Therefore seemingly knowledge 
is not the special matter of studiousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, studiousness is opposed to curiosity. Now curiosity, 
which is derived from "cura" [care], may also refer to elegance of 
apparel and other such things, which regard the body; wherefore the 
Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++13:14">Rm. 13:14</a>): "Make not provision [curam] for the flesh in 
its concupiscences."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++6:13">Jer. 6:13</a>): "From the least of them even 
to the greatest, all study [Douay: 'are given to'] covetousness." Now 
covetousness is not properly about knowledge, but rather about the 
possession of wealth, as stated above (<A Href="SS118.html#SSQ118OUTP1">Question [118]</a>, <A Href="SS118.html#SSQ118A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore 
studiousness, which is derived from "study," is not properly about 
knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++27:11">Prov. 27:11</a>): "Study wisdom, my son, and 
make my heart joyful, that thou mayest give an answer to him that 
reproacheth." Now study, which is commended as a virtue, is the same as 
that to which the Law urges. Therefore studiousness is properly about 
"knowledge."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Properly speaking, study denotes keen application of the 
mind to something. Now the mind is not applied to a thing except by 
knowing that thing. Wherefore the mind's application to knowledge 
precedes its application to those things to which man is directed by his 
knowledge. Hence study regards knowledge in the first place, and as a 
result it regards any other things the working of which requires to be 
directed by knowledge.  Now the virtues lay claim to that matter about 
which they are first and foremost; thus fortitude is concerned about 
dangers of death, and temperance about pleasures of touch. Therefore 
studiousness is properly ascribed to knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Nothing can be done aright as regards other matters, except 
in so far as is previously directed by the knowing reason. Hence 
studiousness, to whatever matter it be applied, has a prior regard for 
knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man's mind is drawn, on account of his affections, towards 
the things for which he has an affection, according to Mt. 6:21, "Where 
thy treasure is, there is thy heart also." And since man has special 
affection for those things which foster the flesh, it follows that man's 
thoughts are concerned about things that foster his flesh, so that man 
seeks to know how he may best sustain his body. Accordingly curiosity is 
accounted to be about things pertaining to the body by reason of things 
pertaining to knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Covetousness craves the acquisition of gain, and for this 
it is very necessary to be skilled in earthly things. Accordingly 
studiousness is ascribed to things pertaining to covetousness.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether studiousness is a part of temperance?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that studiousness is not a part of temperance. For 
a man is said to be studious by reason of his studiousness. Now all 
virtuous persons without exception are called studious according to the 
Philosopher, who frequently employs the term "studious" ({spoudaios}) in 
this sense (Ethic. ix, 4,8,9). [*In the same sense Aristotle says in 
Ethic. iii, 2, that "every vicious person is ignorant of what he ought to 
do."] Therefore studiousness is a general virtue, and not a part of 
temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, studiousness, as stated (<A Href="SS166.html#SSQ166A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), pertains to knowledge. 
But knowledge has no connection with the moral virtues which are in the 
appetitive part of the soul, and pertains rather to the intellectual 
virtues which are in the cognitive part: wherefore solicitude is an act 
of prudence as stated above (<A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>). Therefore studiousness is not 
a part of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a virtue that is ascribed as part of a principal virtue 
resembles the latter as to mode. Now studiousness does not resemble 
temperance as to mode, because temperance takes its name from being a 
kind of restraint, wherefore it is more opposed to the vice that is in 
excess: whereas studiousness is denominated from being the application of 
the mind to something, so that it would seem to be opposed to the vice 
that is in default, namely, neglect of study, rather than to the vice 
which is in excess, namely curiosity. wherefore, on account of its 
resemblance to the latter, Isidore says (Etym. x) that "a studious man is 
one  who is curious to study." Therefore studiousness is not a part of 
temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Morib. Eccl. 21): "We are forbidden 
to be curious: and this is a great gift that temperance bestows." Now 
curiosity is prevented by moderate studiousness. Therefore studiousness 
is a part of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141OUTP1">Question [141]</a>, <A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4,5), it belongs to 
temperance to moderate the movement of the appetite, lest it tend 
excessively to that which is desired naturally. Now just as in respect of 
his corporeal nature man naturally desires the pleasures of food and sex, 
so, in respect of his soul, he naturally desires to know something; thus 
the Philosopher observes at the beginning of his Metaphysics i, 1: "All 
men have a natural desire for knowledge."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The moderation of this desire pertains to the virtue of studiousness; 
wherefore it follows that studiousness is a potential part of temperance, 
as a subordinate virtue annexed to a principal virtue. Moreover, it is 
comprised under modesty for the reason given above (<A Href="SS160.html#SSQ160OUTP1">Question [160]</a>, <A Href="SS160.html#SSQ160A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Prudence is the complement of all the moral virtues, as 
stated in Ethic. vi, 13. Consequently, in so far as the knowledge of 
prudence pertains to all the virtues, the term "studiousness," which 
properly regards knowledge, is applied to all the virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The act of a cognitive power is commanded by the appetitive 
power, which moves all the powers, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
Wherefore knowledge regards a twofold good. One is connected with the act 
of knowledge itself; and this good pertains to the intellectual virtues, 
and consists in man having a true estimate about each thing. The other 
good pertains to the act of the appetitive power, and consists in man's 
appetite being directed aright in applying the cognitive power in this or 
that way to this or that thing. And this belongs to the virtue of 
seriousness. Wherefore it is reckoned among the moral virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[166] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 93) in order to be 
virtuous we must avoid those things to which we are most naturally 
inclined. Hence it is that, since nature inclines us. chiefly to fear 
dangers of death, and to seek pleasures of the flesh, fortitude is 
chiefly commended for a certain steadfast perseverance against such 
dangers, and temperance for a certain restraint from pleasures of the 
flesh. But as regards knowledge, man has contrary inclinations. For on 
the part of the soul, he is inclined to desire knowledge of things; and 
so it behooves him to exercise a praiseworthy restraint on this desire, 
lest he seek knowledge immoderately: whereas on the part of his bodily 
nature, man is inclined to avoid the trouble of seeking knowledge. 
Accordingly, as regards the first inclination studiousness is a kind of 
restraint, and it is in this sense that it is reckoned a  part of 
temperance. But as to the second inclination, this virtue derives its 
praise from a certain keenness of interest in seeking knowledge of 
things; and from this it takes its name. The former is more essential to 
this virtue than the latter: since the desire to know directly regards 
knowledge, to which studiousness is directed, whereas the trouble of 
learning is an obstacle to knowledge, wherefore it is regarded by this 
virtue indirectly, as by that which removes an obstacle.<br>
