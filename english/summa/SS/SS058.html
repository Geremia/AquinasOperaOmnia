  <h3 align="center">OF JUSTICE (TWELVE ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider justice. Under this head there are twelve points of
    inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A1THEP1">(1)</a> What is justice?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether justice is always towards
    another?
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is a virtue?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is in the will as its
    subject?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether it is a general virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether, as a general virtue, it
    is essentially the same as every virtue?<br />

    matter of its own?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether it is about passions, or
    about operations only?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A10THEP1">(10)</a> Whether the mean of justice is
    the real mean?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A11THEP1">(11)</a> Whether the act of justice is to
    render to everyone his own?

    the moral virtues?

    Whether justice is fittingly defined as being the perpetual and constant
    will to render to each one his right?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that lawyers have unfittingly
    defined justice as being "the perpetual and constant will to render to each
    one his right" [*Digest. i, 1; De Just. et Jure 10]. For, according to the
    Philosopher (Ethic. v, 1), justice is a habit which makes a man "capable of
    doing what is just, and of being just in action and in intention." Now
    "will" denotes a power, or also an act. Therefore justice is unfittingly
    defined as being a will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, rectitude of the will is not the will;
    else if the will were its own rectitude, it would follow that no will is
    unrighteous. Yet, according to Anselm (De Veritate xii), justice is
    rectitude. Therefore justice is not the will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no will is perpetual save God's. If
    therefore justice is a perpetual will, in God alone will there be
    justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, whatever is perpetual is constant, since
    it is unchangeable. Therefore it is needless in defining justice, to say
    that it is both "perpetual" and "constant."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, it belongs to the sovereign to give each
    one his right. Therefore, if justice gives each one his right, it follows
    that it is in none but the sovereign: which is absurd.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Moribus Eccl. xv)
    that "justice is love serving God alone." Therefore it does not render to
    each one his right.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The aforesaid definition of justice is fitting
    if understood aright. For since every virtue is a habit that is the
    principle of a good act, a virtue must needs be defined by means of the good
    act bearing on the matter proper to that virtue. Now the proper matter of
    justice consists of those things that belong to our intercourse with other
    men, as shall be shown further on (<a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). Hence the act of justice in relation to its proper matter and object is
    indicated in the words, "Rendering to each one his right," since, as Isidore
    says (Etym. x), "a man is said to be just because he respects the rights
    [jus] of others."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now in order that an act bearing upon any matter whatever be virtuous, it
    requires to be voluntary, stable, and firm, because the Philosopher says
    (Ethic. ii, 4) that in order for an act to be virtuous it needs first of all
    to be done "knowingly," secondly to be done "by choice," and "for a due
    end," thirdly to be done "immovably." Now the first of these is included in
    the second, since "what is done through ignorance is involuntary" (Ethic.
    iii, 1). Hence the definition of justice mentions first the "will," in order
    to show that the act of justice must be voluntary; and mention is made
    afterwards of its "constancy" and "perpetuity" in order to indicate the
    firmness of the act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly, this is a complete definition of justice; save that the act is
    mentioned instead of the habit, which takes its species from that act,
    because habit implies relation to act. And if anyone would reduce it to the
    proper form of a definition, he might say that "justice is a habit whereby a
    man renders to each one his due by a constant and perpetual will": and this
    is about the same definition as that given by the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 5)
    who says that "justice is a habit whereby a man is said to be capable of
    doing just actions in accordance with his choice."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Will here denotes the act, not the
    power: and it is customary among writers to define habits by their acts:
    thus Augustine says (Tract. in Joan. xl) that "faith is to believe what one
    sees not."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Justice is the same as rectitude, not
    essentially but causally; for it is a habit which rectifies the deed and the
    will.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The will may be called perpetual in two
    ways. First on the part of the will's act which endures for ever, and thus
    God's will alone is perpetual. Secondly on the part of the subject, because,
    to wit, a man wills to do a certain thing always. and this is a necessary
    condition of justice. For it does not satisfy the conditions of justice that
    one wish to observe justice in some particular matter for the time being,
    because one could scarcely find a man willing to act unjustly in every case;
    and it is requisite that one should have the will to observe justice at all
    times and in all cases.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Since "perpetual" does not imply
    perpetuity of the act of the will, it is not superfluous to add "constant":
    for while the "perpetual will" denotes the purpose of observing justice
    always, "constant" signifies a firm perseverance in this purpose.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> A judge renders to each one what belongs
    to him, by way of command and direction, because a judge is the
    "personification of justice," and "the sovereign is its guardian" (Ethic. v,
    4). On the other hand, the subjects render to each one what belongs to him,
    by way of execution.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Just as love of God includes love of our
    neighbor, as stated above (<a href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a
    >, <a href="SS025.html#SSQ25A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), so too the service of
    God includes rendering to each one his due.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether justice is always towards one another?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that justice is not always towards
    another. For the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++3%3A22"
      >Rm. 3:22</a
    >) that "the justice of God is by faith of Jesus Christ." Now faith does not
    concern the dealings of one man with another. Neither therefore does
    justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine (De Moribus Eccl.
    xv), "it belongs to justice that man should direct to the service of God his
    authority over the things that are subject to him." Now the sensitive
    appetite is subject to man, according to Gn. 4:7, where it is written: "The
    lust thereof," viz. of sin, "shall be under thee, and thou shalt have
    dominion over it." Therefore it belongs to justice to have dominion over
    one's own appetite: so that justice is towards oneself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the justice of God is eternal. But
    nothing else is co-eternal with God. Therefore justice is not essentially
    towards another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, man's dealings with himself need to be
    rectified no less than his dealings with another. Now man's dealings are
    rectified by justice, according to Prov. 11:5, "The justice of the upright
    shall make his way prosperous." Therefore justice is about our dealings not
    only with others, but also with ourselves.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully says (De Officiis i, 7) that "the
    object of justice is to keep men together in society and mutual
    intercourse." Now this implies relationship of one man to another. Therefore
    justice is concerned only about our dealings with others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS057.html#SSQ57OUTP1"
      >Question [57]</a
    >, <a href="SS057.html#SSQ57A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) since justice by its
    name implies equality, it denotes essentially relation to another, for a
    thing is equal, not to itself, but to another. And forasmuch as it belongs
    to justice to rectify human acts, as stated above (<a
      href="SS057.html#SSQ57OUTP1"
      >Question [57]</a
    >, <a href="SS057.html#SSQ57A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS113.html#FSQ113OUTP1">Question [113]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS113.html#FSQ113A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) this otherness
    which justice demands must needs be between beings capable of action. Now
    actions belong to supposits [*Cf. FP, Question [29], Article [2]] and wholes
    and, properly speaking, not to parts and forms or powers, for we do not say
    properly that the hand strikes, but a man with his hand, nor that heat makes
    a thing hot, but fire by heat, although such expressions may be employed
    metaphorically. Hence, justice properly speaking demands a distinction of
    supposits, and consequently is only in one man towards another. Nevertheless
    in one and the same man we may speak metaphorically of his various
    principles of action such as the reason, the irascible, and the
    concupiscible, as though they were so many agents: so that metaphorically in
    one and the same man there is said to be justice in so far as the reason
    commands the irascible and concupiscible, and these obey reason; and in
    general in so far as to each part of man is ascribed what is becoming to it.
    Hence the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 11) calls this "metaphorical justice."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The justice which faith works in us, is
    that whereby the ungodly is justified it consists in the due coordination of
    the parts of the soul, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS113.html#FSQ113OUTP1">Question [113]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS113.html#FSQ113A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) where we were
    treating of the justification of the ungodly. Now this belongs to
    metaphorical justice, which may be found even in a man who lives all by
    himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God's justice is from eternity in
    respect of the eternal will and purpose (and it is chiefly in this that
    justice consists); although it is not eternal as regards its effect, since
    nothing is co-eternal with God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Man's dealings with himself are
    sufficiently rectified by the rectification of the passions by the other
    moral virtues. But his dealings with others need a special rectification,
    not only in relation to the agent, but also in relation to the person to
    whom they are directed. Hence about such dealings there is a special virtue,
    and this is justice.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether justice is a virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that justice is not a virtue. For
    it is written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++17%3A10"
      >Lk. 17:10</a
    >): "When you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say:
    We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do." Now
    it is not unprofitable to do a virtuous deed: for Ambrose says (De Officiis
    ii, 6): "We look to a profit that is estimated not by pecuniary gain but by
    the acquisition of godliness." Therefore to do what one ought to do, is not
    a virtuous deed. And yet it is an act of justice. Therefore justice is not a
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which is done of necessity, is not
    meritorious. But to render to a man what belongs to him, as justice
    requires, is of necessity. Therefore it is not meritorious. Yet it is by
    virtuous actions that we gain merit. Therefore justice is not a virtue.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every moral virtue is about matters of
    action. Now those things which are wrought externally are not things
    concerning behavior but concerning handicraft, according to the Philosopher
    (Metaph. ix) [*Didot ed., viii, 8]. Therefore since it belongs to justice to
    produce externally a deed that is just in itself, it seems that justice is
    not a moral virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. ii, 49) that "the entire
    structure of good works is built on four virtues," viz. temperance,
    prudence, fortitude and justice<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A human virtue is one "which renders a human
    act and man himself good" [*Ethic. ii, 6], and this can be applied to
    justice. For a man's act is made good through attaining the rule of reason,
    which is the rule whereby human acts are regulated. Hence, since justice
    regulates human operations, it is evident that it renders man's operations
    good, and, as Tully declares (De Officiis i, 7), good men are so called
    chiefly from their justice, wherefore, as he says again (De Officiis i, 7)
    "the luster of virtue appears above all in justice."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When a man does what he ought, he brings
    no gain to the person to whom he does what he ought, but only abstains from
    doing him a harm. He does however profit himself, in so far as he does what
    he ought, spontaneously and readily, and this is to act virtuously. Hence it
    is written (Wis. 8:7) that Divine wisdom "teacheth temperance, and prudence,
    and justice, and fortitude, which are such things as men (i.e. virtuous men)
    can have nothing more profitable in life."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Necessity is twofold. One arises from
    "constraint," and this removes merit, since it runs counter to the will. The
    other arises from the obligation of a "command," or from the necessity of
    obtaining an end, when, to wit, a man is unable to achieve the end of virtue
    without doing some particular thing. The latter necessity does not remove
    merit, when a man does voluntarily that which is necessary in this way. It
    does however exclude the credit of supererogation, according to 1 Cor. 9:16,
    "If I preach the Gospel, it is no glory to me, for a necessity lieth upon
    me."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Justice is concerned about external
    things, not by making them, which pertains to art, but by using them in our
    dealings with other men.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether justice is in the will as its subject?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that justice is not in the will as
    its subject. For justice is sometimes called truth. But truth is not in the
    will, but in the intellect. Therefore justice is not in the will as its
    subject.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, justice is about our dealings with
    others. Now it belongs to the reason to direct one thing in relation to
    another. Therefore justice is not in the will as its subject but in the
    reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, justice is not an intellectual virtue,
    since it is not directed to knowledge; wherefore it follows that it is a
    moral virtue. Now the subject of moral virtue is the faculty which is
    "rational by participation," viz. the irascible and the concupiscible, as
    the Philosopher declares (Ethic. i, 13). Therefore justice is not in the
    will as its subject, but in the irascible and concupiscible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Anselm says (De Verit. xii) that "justice is
    rectitude of the will observed for its own sake."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The subject of a virtue is the power whose act
    that virtue aims at rectifying. Now justice does not aim at directing an act
    of the cognitive power, for we are not said to be just through knowing
    something aright. Hence the subject of justice is not the intellect or
    reason which is a cognitive power. But since we are said to be just through
    doing something aright, and because the proximate principle of action is the
    appetitive power, justice must needs be in some appetitive power as its
    subject.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the appetite is twofold; namely, the will which is in the reason and the
    sensitive appetite which follows on sensitive apprehension, and is divided
    into the irascible and the concupiscible, as stated in the FP, Question
    [81], Article [2]. Again the act of rendering his due to each man cannot
    proceed from the sensitive appetite, because sensitive apprehension does not
    go so far as to be able to consider the relation of one thing to another;
    but this is proper to the reason. Therefore justice cannot be in the
    irascible or concupiscible as its subject, but only in the will: hence the
    Philosopher (Ethic. v, 1) defines justice by an act of the will, as may be
    seen above (<a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since the will is the rational appetite,
    when the rectitude of the reason which is called truth is imprinted on the
    will on account of its nighness to the reason, this imprint retains the name
    of truth; and hence it is that justice sometimes goes by the name of
    truth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The will is borne towards its object
    consequently on the apprehension of reason: wherefore, since the reason
    directs one thing in relation to another, the will can will one thing in
    relation to another, and this belongs to justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Not only the irascible and concupiscible
    parts are "rational by participation," but the entire "appetitive" faculty,
    as stated in Ethic. i, 13, because all appetite is subject to reason. Now
    the will is contained in the appetitive faculty, wherefore it can be the
    subject of moral virtue.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether justice is a general virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that justice is not a general
    virtue. For justice is specified with the other virtues, according to Wis.
    8:7, "She teacheth temperance and prudence, and justice, and fortitude." Now
    the "general" is not specified or reckoned together with the species
    contained under the same "general." Therefore justice is not a general
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as justice is accounted a cardinal
    virtue, so are temperance and fortitude. Now neither temperance nor
    fortitude is reckoned to be a general virtue. Therefore neither should
    justice in any way be reckoned a general virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, justice is always towards others, as
    stated above (<a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But a sin
    committed against one's neighbor cannot be a general sin, because it is
    condivided with sin committed against oneself. Therefore neither is justice
    a general virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 1) that
    "justice is every virtue."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Justice, as stated above (<a
      href="SS058.html#SSQ58A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >) directs man in his relations with other men. Now this may happen in two
    ways: first as regards his relation with individuals, secondly as regards
    his relations with others in general, in so far as a man who serves a
    community, serves all those who are included in that community. Accordingly
    justice in its proper acceptation can be directed to another in both these
    senses. Now it is evident that all who are included in a community, stand in
    relation to that community as parts to a whole; while a part, as such,
    belongs to a whole, so that whatever is the good of a part can be directed
    to the good of the whole. It follows therefore that the good of any virtue,
    whether such virtue direct man in relation to himself, or in relation to
    certain other individual persons, is referable to the common good, to which
    justice directs: so that all acts of virtue can pertain to justice, in so
    far as it directs man to the common good. It is in this sense that justice
    is called a general virtue. And since it belongs to the law to direct to the
    common good, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS090.html#FSQ90A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it follows that
    the justice which is in this way styled general, is called "legal justice,"
    because thereby man is in harmony with the law which directs the acts of all
    the virtues to the common good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Justice is specified or enumerated with
    the other virtues, not as a general but as a special virtue, as we shall
    state further on (<a href="SS058.html#SSQ58ATHEP1">Articles [7]</a
    >,12).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Temperance and fortitude are in the
    sensitive appetite, viz. in the concupiscible and irascible. Now these
    powers are appetitive of certain particular goods, even as the senses are
    cognitive of particulars. On the other hand justice is in the intellective
    appetite as its subject, which can have the universal good as its object,
    knowledge whereof belongs to the intellect. Hence justice can be a general
    virtue rather than temperance or fortitude.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Things referable to oneself are
    referable to another, especially in regard to the common good. Wherefore
    legal justice, in so far as it directs to the common good, may be called a
    general virtue: and in like manner injustice may be called a general sin;
    hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Jn++3%3A4"
      >1 Jn. 3:4</a
    >) that all "sin is iniquity."<br />

    Whether justice, as a general virtue, is essentially the same as all
    virtue?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that justice, as a general virtue,
    is essentially the same as all virtue. For the Philosopher says (Ethic. v,
    1) that "virtue and legal justice are the same as all virtue, but differ in
    their mode of being." Now things that differ merely in their mode of being
    or logically do not differ essentially. Therefore justice is essentially the
    same as every virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every virtue that is not essentially the
    same as all virtue is a part of virtue. Now the aforesaid justice, according
    to the Philosopher (Ethic. v. 1) "is not a part but the whole of virtue."
    Therefore the aforesaid justice is essentially the same as all virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the essence of a virtue does not change
    through that virtue directing its act to some higher end even as the habit
    of temperance remains essentially the same even though its act be directed
    to a Divine good. Now it belongs to legal justice that the acts of all the
    virtues are directed to a higher end, namely the common good of the
    multitude, which transcends the good of one single individual. Therefore it
    seems that legal justice is essentially all virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, every good of a part can be directed to
    the good of the whole, so that if it be not thus directed it would seem
    without use or purpose. But that which is in accordance with virtue cannot
    be so. Therefore it seems that there can be no act of any virtue, that does
    not belong to general justice, which directs to the common good; and so it
    seems that general justice is essentially the same as all virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 1) that "many
    are able to be virtuous in matters affecting themselves, but are unable to
    be virtuous in matters relating to others," and (Polit. iii, 2) that "the
    virtue of the good man is not strictly the same as the virtue of the good
    citizen." Now the virtue of a good citizen is general justice, whereby a man
    Is directed to the common good. Therefore general justice is not the same as
    virtue in general, and it is possible to have one without the other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing is said to be "general" in two ways.
    First, by "predication": thus "animal" is general in relation to man and
    horse and the like: and in this sense that which is general must needs be
    essentially the same as the things in relation to which it is general, for
    the reason that the genus belongs to the essence of the species, and forms
    part of its definition. Secondly a thing is said to be general "virtually";
    thus a universal cause is general in relation to all its effects, the sun,
    for instance, in relation to all bodies that are illumined, or transmuted by
    its power; and in this sense there is no need for that which is "general" to
    be essentially the same as those things in relation to which it is general,
    since cause and effect are not essentially the same. Now it is in the latter
    sense that, according to what has been said (<a
      href="SS058.html#SSQ58A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >), legal justice is said to be a general virtue, in as much, to wit, as it
    directs the acts of the other virtues to its own end, and this is to move
    all the other virtues by its command; for just as charity may be called a
    general virtue in so far as it directs the acts of all the virtues to the
    Divine good, so too is legal justice, in so far as it directs the acts of
    all the virtues to the common good. Accordingly, just as charity which
    regards the Divine good as its proper object, is a special virtue in respect
    of its essence, so too legal justice is a special virtue in respect of its
    essence, in so far as it regards the common good as its proper object. And
    thus it is in the sovereign principally and by way of a mastercraft, while
    it is secondarily and administratively in his subjects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    However the name of legal justice can be given to every virtue, in so far as
    every virtue is directed to the common good by the aforesaid legal justice,
    which though special essentially is nevertheless virtually general. Speaking
    in this way, legal justice is essentially the same as all virtue, but
    differs therefrom logically: and it is in this sense that the Philosopher
    speaks.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Wherefore the Replies to the First and Second Objections are manifest.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument again takes legal justice
    for the virtue commanded by legal justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Every virtue strictly speaking directs
    its act to that virtue's proper end: that it should happen to be directed to
    a further end either always or sometimes, does not belong to that virtue
    considered strictly, for it needs some higher virtue to direct it to that
    end. Consequently there must be one supreme virtue essentially distinct from
    every other virtue, which directs all the virtues to the common good; and
    this virtue is legal justice.<br />

    Whether there is a particular besides a general justice?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is not a particular
    besides a general justice. For there is nothing superfluous in the virtues,
    as neither is there in nature. Now general justice directs man sufficiently
    in all his relations with other men. Therefore there is no need for a
    particular justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the species of a virtue does not vary
    according to "one" and "many." But legal justice directs one man to another
    in matters relating to the multitude, as shown above (<a
      href="SS058.html#SSQ58ATHEP1"
      >Articles [5]</a
    >,6). Therefore there is not another species of justice directing one man to
    another in matters relating to the individual.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, between the individual and the general
    public stands the household community. Consequently, if in addition to
    general justice there is a particular justice corresponding to the
    individual, for the same reason there should be a domestic justice directing
    man to the common good of a household: and yet this is not the case.
    Therefore neither should there be a particular besides a legal justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Chrysostom in his commentary on Mt. 5:6,
    "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after justice," says (Hom. xv in
    Matth.): "By justice He signifies either the general virtue, or the
    particular virtue which is opposed to covetousness."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS058.html#SSQ58A6THEP1"
      >Article [6]</a
    >), legal justice is not essentially the same as every virtue, and besides
    legal justice which directs man immediately to the common good, there is a
    need for other virtues to direct him immediately in matters relating to
    particular goods: and these virtues may be relative to himself or to another
    individual person. Accordingly, just as in addition to legal justice there
    is a need for particular virtues to direct man in relation to himself, such
    as temperance and fortitude, so too besides legal justice there is need for
    particular justice to direct man in his relations to other individuals.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Legal justice does indeed direct man
    sufficiently in his relations towards others. As regards the common good it
    does so immediately, but as to the good of the individual, it does so
    mediately. Wherefore there is need for particular justice to direct a man
    immediately to the good of another individual.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The common good of the realm and the
    particular good of the individual differ not only in respect of the "many"
    and the "few," but also under a formal aspect. For the aspect of the
    "common" good differs from the aspect of the "individual" good, even as the
    aspect of "whole" differs from that of "part." Wherefore the Philosopher
    says (Polit. i, 1) that "they are wrong who maintain that the State and the
    home and the like differ only as many and few and not specifically."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The household community, according to
    the Philosopher (Polit. i, 2), differs in respect of a threefold fellowship;
    namely "of husband and wife, father and son, master and slave," in each of
    which one person is, as it were, part of the other. Wherefore between such
    persons there is not justice simply, but a species of justice, viz.
    "domestic" justice, as stated in Ethic. v, 6.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether particular justice has a special matter?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that particular justice has no
    special matter. Because a gloss on Gn. 2:14, "The fourth river is
    Euphrates," says: "Euphrates signifies 'fruitful'; nor is it stated through
    what country it flows, because justice pertains to all the parts of the
    soul." Now this would not be the case, if justice had a special matter,
    since every special matter belongs to a special power. Therefore particular
    justice has no special matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Questions. lxxxiii, qu.
    61) that "the soul has four virtues whereby, in this life, it lives
    spiritually, viz. temperance, prudence, fortitude and justice;" and he says
    that "the fourth is justice, which pervades all the virtues." Therefore
    particular justice, which is one of the four cardinal virtues, has no
    special matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, justice directs man sufficiently in
    matters relating to others. Now a man can be directed to others in all
    matters relating to this life. Therefore the matter of justice is general
    and not special.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher reckons (Ethic. v, 2)
    particular justice to be specially about those things which belong to social
    life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Whatever can be rectified by reason is the
    matter of moral virtue, for this is defined in reference to right reason,
    according to the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 6). Now the reason can rectify not
    only the internal passions of the soul, but also external actions, and also
    those external things of which man can make use. And yet it is in respect of
    external actions and external things by means of which men can communicate
    with one another, that the relation of one man to another is to be
    considered; whereas it is in respect of internal passions that we consider
    man's rectitude in himself. Consequently, since justice is directed to
    others, it is not about the entire matter of moral virtue, but only about
    external actions and things, under a certain special aspect of the object,
    in so far as one man is related to another through them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is true that justice belongs
    essentially to one part of the soul, where it resides as in its subject; and
    this is the will which moves by its command all the other parts of the soul;
    and accordingly justice belongs to all the parts of the soul, not directly
    but by a kind of diffusion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), the cardinal
    virtues may be taken in two ways: first as special virtues, each having a
    determinate matter; secondly, as certain general modes of virtue. In this
    latter sense Augustine speaks in the passage quoted: for he says that
    "prudence is knowledge of what we should seek and avoid, temperance is the
    curb on the lust for fleeting pleasures, fortitude is strength of mind in
    bearing with passing trials, justice is the love of God and our neighbor
    which pervades the other virtues, that is to say, is the common principle of
    the entire order between one man and another."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A man's internal passions which are a
    part of moral matter, are not in themselves directed to another man, which
    belongs to the specific nature of justice; yet their effects, i.e. external
    actions, are capable of being directed to another man. Consequently it does
    not follow that the matter of justice is general.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether justice is about the passions?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that justice is about the passions.
    For the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 3) that "moral virtue is about pleasure
    and pain." Now pleasure or delight, and pain are passions, as stated above
    [*FS, Question [23], Article [4]; FS, Question [31], Article [1]; FS,
    Question [35], Article [1]] when we were treating of the passions. Therefore
    justice, being a moral virtue, is about the passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, justice is the means of rectifying a
    man's operations in relation to another man. Now such like operations cannot
    be rectified unless the passions be rectified, because it is owing to
    disorder of the passions that there is disorder in the aforesaid operations:
    thus sexual lust leads to adultery, and overmuch love of money leads to
    theft. Therefore justice must needs be about the passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, even as particular justice is towards
    another person so is legal justice. Now legal justice is about the passions,
    else it would not extend to all the virtues, some of which are evidently
    about the passions. Therefore justice is about the passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 1) that
    justice is about operations.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The true answer to this question may be
    gathered from a twofold source. First from the subject of justice, i.e. from
    the will, whose movements or acts are not passions, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS022.html#FSQ22OUTP1">Question [22]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS022.html#FSQ22A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS059.html#FSQ59OUTP1">Question [59]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS059.html#FSQ59A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), for it is only the
    sensitive appetite whose movements are called passions. Hence justice is not
    about the passions, as are temperance and fortitude, which are in the
    irascible and concupiscible parts. Secondly, on he part of the matter,
    because justice is about man's relations with another, and we are not
    directed immediately to another by the internal passions. Therefore justice
    is not about the passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Not every moral virtue is about pleasure
    and pain as its proper matter, since fortitude is about fear and daring: but
    every moral virtue is directed to pleasure and pain, as to ends to be
    acquired, for, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 11), "pleasure and pain
    are the principal end in respect of which we say that this is an evil, and
    that a good": and in this way too they belong to justice, since "a man is
    not just unless he rejoice in just actions" (Ethic. i, 8).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> External operations are as it were
    between external things, which are their matter, and internal passions,
    which are their origin. Now it happens sometimes that there is a defect in
    one of these, without there being a defect in the other. Thus a man may
    steal another's property, not through the desire to have the thing, but
    through the will to hurt the man; or vice versa, a man may covet another's
    property without wishing to steal it. Accordingly the directing of
    operations in so far as they tend towards external things, belongs to
    justice, but in so far as they arise from the passions, it belongs to the
    other moral virtues which are about the passions. Hence justice hinders
    theft of another's property, in so far as stealing is contrary to the,
    equality that should be maintained in external things, while liberality
    hinders it as resulting from an immoderate desire for wealth. Since,
    however, external operations take their species, not from the internal
    passions but from external things as being their objects, it follows that,
    external operations are essentially the matter of justice rather than of the
    other moral virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The common good is the end of each
    individual member of a community, just as the good of the whole is the end
    of each part. On the other hand the good of one individual is not the end of
    another individual: wherefore legal justice which is directed to the common
    good, is more capable of extending to the internal passions whereby man is
    disposed in some way or other in himself, than particular justice which is
    directed to the good of another individual: although legal justice extends
    chiefly to other virtues in the point of their external operations, in so
    far, to wit, as "the law commands us to perform the actions of a courageous
    person... the actions of a temperate person... and the actions of a gentle
    person" (Ethic. v, 5).<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the mean of justice is the real mean?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the mean of justice is not the
    real mean. For the generic nature remains entire in each species. Now moral
    virtue is defined (Ethic. ii, 6) to be "an elective habit which observes the
    mean fixed, in our regard, by reason." Therefore justice observes the
    rational and not the real mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in things that are good simply, there is
    neither excess nor defect, and consequently neither is there a mean; as is
    clearly the case with the virtues, according to Ethic. ii, 6. Now justice is
    about things that are good simply, as stated in Ethic. v. Therefore justice
    does not observe the real mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the reason why the other virtues are
    said to observe the rational and not the real mean, is because in their case
    the mean varies according to different persons, since what is too much for
    one is too little for another (Ethic. ii, 6). Now this is also the case in
    justice: for one who strikes a prince does not receive the same punishment
    as one who strikes a private individual. Therefore justice also observes,
    not the real, but the rational mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 6; v, 4)
    that the mean of justice is to be taken according to "arithmetical"
    proportion, so that it is the real mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS058.html#SSQ58A9THEP1"
      >Article [9]</a
    >; <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS059.html#FSQ59OUTP1">Question [59]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS059.html#FSQ59A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the other moral
    virtues are chiefly concerned with the passions, the regulation of which is
    gauged entirely by a comparison with the very man who is the subject of
    those passions, in so far as his anger and desire are vested with their
    various due circumstances. Hence the mean in such like virtues is measured
    not by the proportion of one thing to another, but merely by comparison with
    the virtuous man himself, so that with them the mean is only that which is
    fixed by reason in our regard.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, the matter of justice is external operation, in so far as
    an operation or the thing used in that operation is duly proportionate to
    another person, wherefore the mean of justice consists in a certain
    proportion of equality between the external thing and the external person.
    Now equality is the real mean between greater and less, as stated in Metaph.
    x [*Didot ed., ix, 5; Cf. Ethic. v, 4]: wherefore justice observes the real
    mean.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This real mean is also the rational
    mean, wherefore justice satisfies the conditions of a moral virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> We may speak of a thing being good
    simply in two ways. First a thing may be good in every way: thus the virtues
    are good; and there is neither mean nor extremes in things that are good
    simply in this sense. Secondly a thing is said to be good simply through
    being good absolutely i.e. in its nature, although it may become evil
    through being abused. Such are riches and honors; and in the like it is
    possible to find excess, deficiency and mean, as regards men who can use
    them well or ill: and it is in this sense that justice is about things that
    are good simply.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The injury inflicted bears a different
    proportion to a prince from that which it bears to a private person:
    wherefore each injury requires to be equalized by vengeance in a different
    way: and this implies a real and not merely a rational diversity.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the act of justice is to render to each one his own?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the act of justice is not to
    render to each one his own. For Augustine (De Trin. xiv, 9) ascribes to
    justice the act of succoring the needy. Now in succoring the needy we give
    them what is not theirs but ours. Therefore the act of justice does not
    consist in rendering to each one his own.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Tully says (De Offic. i, 7) that
    "beneficence which we may call kindness or liberality, belongs to justice."
    Now it pertains to liberality to give to another of one's own, not of what
    is his. Therefore the act of justice does not consist in rendering to each
    one his own.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it belongs to justice not only to
    distribute things duly, but also to repress injurious actions, such as
    murder, adultery and so forth. But the rendering to each one of what is his
    seems to belong solely to the distribution of things. Therefore the act of
    justice is not sufficiently described by saying that it consists in
    rendering to each one his own.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 24): "It is
    justice that renders to each one what is his, and claims not another's
    property; it disregards its own profit in order to preserve the common
    equity."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS058.html#SSQ58ATHEP1"
      >Articles [8]</a
    >,10), the matter of justice is an external operation in so far as either it
    or the thing we use by it is made proportionate to some other person to whom
    we are related by justice. Now each man's own is that which is due to him
    according to equality of proportion. Therefore the proper act of justice is
    nothing else than to render to each one his own.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since justice is a cardinal virtue,
    other secondary virtues, such as mercy, liberality and the like are
    connected with it, as we shall state further on (<a
      href="SS080.html#SSQ80OUTP1"
      >Question [80]</a
    >, <a href="SS080.html#SSQ80A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Wherefore to succor
    the needy, which belongs to mercy or pity, and to be liberally beneficent,
    which pertains to liberality, are by a kind of reduction ascribed to justice
    as to their principal virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the Philosopher states (Ethic. v, 4),
    in matters of justice, the name of "profit" is extended to whatever is
    excessive, and whatever is deficient is called "loss." The reason for this
    is that justice is first of all and more commonly exercised in voluntary
    interchanges of things, such as buying and selling, wherein those
    expressions are properly employed; and yet they are transferred to all other
    matters of justice. The same applies to the rendering to each one of what is
    his own.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether justice stands foremost among all moral virtues?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that justice does not stand
    foremost among all the moral virtues. Because it belongs to justice to
    render to each one what is his, whereas it belongs to liberality to give of
    one's own, and this is more virtuous. Therefore liberality is a greater
    virtue than justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing is adorned by a less excellent
    thing than itself. Now magnanimity is the ornament both of justice and of
    all the virtues, according to Ethic. iv, 3. Therefore magnanimity is more
    excellent than justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, virtue is about that which is
    "difficult" and "good," as stated in Ethic. ii, 3. But fortitude is about
    more difficult things than justice is, since it is about dangers of death,
    according to Ethic. iii, 6. Therefore fortitude is more excellent than
    justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully says (De Offic. i, 7): "Justice is the
    most resplendent of the virtues, and gives its name to a good man."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> If we speak of legal justice, it is evident
    that it stands foremost among all the moral virtues, for as much as the
    common good transcends the individual good of one person. In this sense the
    Philosopher declares (Ethic. v, 1) that "the most excellent of the virtues
    would seem to be justice, and more glorious than either the evening or the
    morning star." But, even if we speak of particular justice, it excels the
    other moral virtues for two reasons. The first reason may be taken from the
    subject, because justice is in the more excellent part of the soul, viz. the
    rational appetite or will, whereas the other moral virtues are in the
    sensitive appetite, whereunto appertain the passions which are the matter of
    the other moral virtues. The second reason is taken from the object, because
    the other virtues are commendable in respect of the sole good of the
    virtuous person himself, whereas justice is praiseworthy in respect of the
    virtuous person being well disposed towards another, so that justice is
    somewhat the good of another person, as stated in Ethic. v, 1. Hence the
    Philosopher says (Rhet. i, 9): "The greatest virtues must needs be those
    which are most profitable to other persons, because virtue is a faculty of
    doing good to others. For this reason the greatest honors are accorded the
    brave and the just, since bravery is useful to others in warfare, and
    justice is useful to others both in warfare and in time of peace."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the liberal man gives of his
    own, yet he does so in so far as he takes into consideration the good of his
    own virtue, while the just man gives to another what is his, through
    consideration of the common good. Moreover justice is observed towards all,
    whereas liberality cannot extend to all. Again liberality which gives of a
    man's own is based on justice, whereby one renders to each man what is
    his.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When magnanimity is added to justice it
    increases the latter's goodness; and yet without justice it would not even
    be a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although fortitude is about the most
    difficult things, it is not about the best, for it is only useful in
    warfare, whereas justice is useful both in war and in peace, as stated
    above.<br />
