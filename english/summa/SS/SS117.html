  <h3 align="left">Whether liberality is a virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that liberality is not a virtue. For no
    virtue is contrary to a natural inclination. Now it is a natural inclination
    for one to provide for oneself more than for others: and yet it pertains to
    the liberal man to do the contrary, since, according to the Philosopher
    (Ethic. iv, 1), "it is the mark of a liberal man not to look to himself, so
    that he leaves for himself the lesser things." Therefore liberality is not a
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, man sustains life by means of riches,
    and wealth contributes to happiness instrumentally, as stated in Ethic. i,
    8. Since, then, every virtue is directed to happiness, it seems that the
    liberal man is not virtuous, for the Philosopher says of him (Ethic. iv, 1)
    that "he is inclined neither to receive nor to keep money, but to give it
    away."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the virtues are connected with one
    another. But liberality does not seem to be connected with the other
    virtues: since many are virtuous who cannot be liberal, for they have
    nothing to give; and many give or spend liberally who are not virtuous
    otherwise. Therefore liberality is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Offic. i) that "the Gospel
    contains many instances in which a just liberality is inculcated." Now in
    the Gospel nothing is taught that does not pertain to virtue. Therefore
    liberality is a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19), "it
    belongs to virtue to use well the things that we can use ill." Now we may
    use both well and ill, not only the things that are within us, such as the
    powers and the passions of the soul, but also those that are without, such
    as the things of this world that are granted us for our livelihood.
    Wherefore since it belongs to liberality to use these things well, it
    follows that liberality is a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to Ambrose (Serm. lxiv de
    Temp.) and Basil (Hom. in Luc. xii, 18) excess of riches is granted by God
    to some, in order that they may obtain the merit of a good stewardship. But
    it suffices for one man to have few things. Wherefore the liberal man
    commendably spends more on others than on himself. Nevertheless we are bound
    to be more provident for ourselves in spiritual goods, in which each one is
    able to look after himself in the first place. And yet it does not belong to
    the liberal man even in temporal things to attend so much to others as to
    lose sight of himself and those belonging to him. Wherefore Ambrose says (De
    Offic. i): "It is a commendable liberality not to neglect your relatives if
    you know them to be in want."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It does not belong to a liberal man so
    to give away his riches that nothing is left for his own support, nor the
    wherewithal to perform those acts of virtue whereby happiness is acquired.
    Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "the liberal man does not
    neglect his own, wishing thus to be of help to certain people"; and Ambrose
    says (De Offic. i) that "Our Lord does not wish a man to pour out his riches
    all at once, but to dispense them: unless he do as Eliseus did, who slew his
    oxen and fed the poor, that he might not be bound by any household cares."
    For this belongs to the state of perfection, of which we shall speak farther
    on (<a href="SS184.html#SSQ184OUTP1">Question [184]</a>,
    <a href="SS186.html#SSQ186OUTP1">Question [186]</a>,
    <a href="SS186.html#SSQ186A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It must be observed, however, that the very act of giving away one's
    possessions liberally, in so far as it is an act of virtue, is directed to
    happiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1),
    "those who spend much on intemperance are not liberal but prodigal"; and
    likewise whoever spends what he has for the sake of other sins. Hence
    Ambrose says (De Offic. i): "If you assist to rob others of their
    possessions, your honesty is not to be commended, nor is your liberality
    genuine if you give for the sake of boasting rather than of pity." Wherefore
    those who lack other virtues, though they spend much on certain evil works,
    are not liberal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, nothing hinders certain people from spending much on good uses,
    without having the habit of liberality: even as men perform works of other
    virtues, before having the habit of virtue, though not in the same way as
    virtuous people, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). In like manner
    nothing prevents a virtuous man from being liberal, although he be poor.
    Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1): "Liberality is proportionate to a
    man's substance," i.e. his means, "for it consists, not in the quantity
    given, but in the habit of the giver": and Ambrose says (De Offic. i) that
    "it is the heart that makes a gift rich or poor, and gives things their
    value."

  <h3 align="left">Whether liberality is about money?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that liberality is not about money. For
    every moral virtue is about operations and passions. Now it is proper to
    justice to be about operations, as stated in Ethic. v, 1. Therefore, since
    liberality is a moral virtue, it seems that it is about passions and not
    about money.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to a liberal man to make use
    of any kind of wealth. Now natural riches are more real than artificial
    riches, according to the Philosopher (Polit. i, 5,6). Therefore liberality
    is not chiefly about money.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, different virtues have different matter,
    since habits are distinguished by their objects. But external things are the
    matter of distributive and commutative justice. Therefore they are not the
    matter of liberality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that
    "liberality seems to be a mean in the matter of money."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 1) it
    belongs to the liberal man to part with things. Hence liberality is also
    called open-handedness [largitas], because that which is open does not
    withhold things but parts of them. The term "liberality" seems also to
    allude to this, since when a man quits hold of a thing he frees it
    [liberat], so to speak, from his keeping and ownership, and shows his mind
    to be free of attachment thereto. Now those things which are the subject of
    a man's free-handedness towards others are the goods he possesses, which are
    denoted by the term "money." Therefore the proper matter of liberality is
    money.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS117.html#SSQ117A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 3), liberality depends not on the quantity given, but on the heart of
    the giver. Now the heart of the giver is disposed according to the passions
    of love and desire, and consequently those of pleasure and sorrow, towards
    the things given. Hence the interior passions are the immediate matter of
    liberality, while exterior money is the object of those same passions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says in his book De
    Disciplina Christi (Tract. de divers, i), everything whatsoever man has on
    earth, and whatsoever he owns, goes by the name of "'pecunia' [money],
    because in olden times men's possessions consisted entirely of 'pecora'
    [flocks]." And the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1): "We give the name of
    money to anything that can be valued in currency."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Justice establishes equality in external
    things, but has nothing to do, properly speaking, with the regulation of
    internal passions: wherefore money is in one way the matter of liberality,
    and in another way of justice.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether using money is the act of liberality?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that using money is not the act of
    liberality. For different virtues have different acts. But using money is
    becoming to other virtues, such as justice and magnificence. Therefore it is
    not the proper act of liberality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to a liberal man, not only to
    give but also to receive and keep. But receiving and keeping do not seem to
    be connected with the use of money. Therefore using money seems to be
    unsuitably assigned as the proper act of liberality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the use of money consists not only in
    giving it but also in spending it. But the spending of money refers to the
    spender, and consequently is not an act of liberality: for Seneca says (De
    Benef. v): "A man is not liberal by giving to himself." Therefore not every
    use of money belongs to liberality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1): "In
    whatever matter a man is virtuous, he will make the best use of that matter:
    Therefore he that has the virtue with regard to money will make the best use
    of riches." Now such is the liberal man. Therefore the good use of money is
    the act of liberality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The species of an act is taken from its object,
    as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now the object or
    matter of liberality is money and whatever has a money value, as stated in
    the foregoing Article (ad 2). And since every virtue is consistent with its
    object, it follows that, since liberality is a virtue, its act is consistent
    with money. Now money comes under the head of useful goods, since all
    external goods are directed to man's use. Hence the proper act of liberality
    is making use of money or riches.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It belongs to liberality to make good
    use of riches as such, because riches are the proper matter of liberality.
    On the other hand it belongs to justice to make use of riches under another
    aspect, namely, that of debt, in so far as an external thing is due to
    another. And it belongs to magnificence to make use of riches under a
    special aspect, in so far, to wit, as they are employed for the fulfilment
    of some great deed. Hence magnificence stands in relation to liberality as
    something in addition thereto, as we shall explain farther on (<a
      href="SS134.html#SSQ134OUTP1"
      >Question [134]</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It belongs to a virtuous man not only to
    make good use of his matter or instrument, but also to provide opportunities
    for that good use. Thus it belongs to a soldier's fortitude not only to
    wield his sword against the foe, but also to sharpen his sword and keep it
    in its sheath. Thus, too, it belongs to liberality not only to use money,
    but also to keep it in preparation and safety in order to make fitting use
    of it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated (<a
      href="SS117.html#SSQ117A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, ad 1), the internal passions whereby man is affected towards money are
    the proximate matter of liberality. Hence it belongs to liberality before
    all that a man should not be prevented from making any due use of money
    through an inordinate affection for it. Now there is a twofold use of money:
    one consists in applying it to one's own use, and would seem to come under
    the designation of costs or expenditure; while the other consists in
    devoting it to the use of others, and comes under the head of gifts. Hence
    it belongs to liberality that one be not hindered by an immoderate love of
    money, either from spending it becomingly, or from making suitable gifts.
    Therefore liberality is concerned with giving and spending, according to the
    Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 1). The saying of Seneca refers to liberality as
    regards giving: for a man is not said to be liberal for the reason that he
    gives something to himself.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether it belongs to a liberal man chiefly to give?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it does not belong to a liberal man
    chiefly to give. For liberality, like all other moral virtues, is regulated
    by prudence. Now it seems to belong very much to prudence that a man should
    keep his riches. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "those
    who have not earned money, but have received the money earned by others,
    spend it more liberally, because they have not experienced the want of it."
    Therefore it seems that giving does not chiefly belong to the liberal
    man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no man is sorry for what he intends
    chiefly to do, nor does he cease from doing it. But a liberal man is
    sometimes sorry for what he has given, nor does he give to all, as stated in
    Ethic. iv, 1. Therefore it does not belong chiefly to a liberal man to
    give.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in order to accomplish what he intends
    chiefly, a man employs all the ways he can. Now a liberal man is not a
    beggar, as the Philosopher observes (Ethic. iv, 1); and yet by begging he
    might provide himself with the means of giving to others. Therefore it seems
    that he does not chiefly aim at giving.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, man is bound to look after himself
    rather than others. But by spending he looks after himself, whereas by
    giving he looks after others. Therefore it belongs to a liberal man to spend
    rather than to give.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "it
    belongs to a liberal man to surpass in giving."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is proper to a liberal man to use money. Now
    the use of money consists in parting with it. For the acquisition of money
    is like generation rather than use: while the keeping of money, in so far as
    it is directed to facilitate the use of money, is like a habit. Now in
    parting with a thing ---for instance, when we throw something---the farther
    we put it away the greater the force [virtus] employed. Hence parting with
    money by giving it to others proceeds from a greater virtue than when we
    spend it on ourselves. But it is proper to a virtue as such to tend to what
    is more perfect, since "virtue is a kind of perfection" (Phys. vii, text.
    17,18). Therefore a liberal man is praised chiefly for giving.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It belongs to prudence to keep money,
    lest it be stolen or spent uselessly. But to spend it usefully is not less
    but more prudent than to keep it usefully: since more things have to be
    considered in money's use, which is likened to movement, than in its
    keeping, which is likened to rest. As to those who, having received money
    that others have earned, spend it more liberally, through not having
    experienced the want of it, if their inexperience is the sole cause of their
    liberal expenditure they have not the virtue of liberality. Sometimes,
    however, this inexperience merely removes the impediment to liberality, so
    that it makes them all the more ready to act liberally, because, not
    unfrequently, the fear of want that results from the experience of want
    hinders those who have acquired money from using it up by acting with
    liberality; as does likewise the love they have for it as being their own
    effect, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 1).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated in this and the preceding
    Article, it belongs to liberality to make fitting use of money, and
    consequently to give it in a fitting manner, since this is a use of money.
    Again, every virtue is grieved by whatever is contrary to its act, and
    avoids whatever hinders that act. Now two things are opposed to suitable
    giving; namely, not giving what ought suitably to be given, and giving
    something unsuitably. Wherefore the liberal man is grieved at both: but
    especially at the former, since it is more opposed to his proper act. For
    this reason, too, he does not give to all: since his act would be hindered
    were he to give to everyone: for he would not have the means of giving to
    those to whom it were fitting for him to give.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Giving and receiving are related to one
    another as action and passion. Now the same thing is not the principle of
    both action and passion. Hence, since liberality is a principle of giving,
    it does not belong to the liberal man to be ready to receive, and still less
    to beg. Hence the verse:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    'In this world he that wishes to be pleasing to many Should give often, take
    seldom, ask never.' But he makes provision in order to give certain things
    according as liberality requires; such are the fruits of his own
    possessions, for he is careful about realizing them that he may make a
    liberal use thereof.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether liberality is a part of justice?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that liberality is not a part of
    justice. For justice regards that which is due. Now the more a thing is due
    the less liberally is it given. Therefore liberality is not a part of
    justice, but is incompatible with it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, justice is about operation as stated
    above (<a href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>,
    <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3): whereas
    liberality is chiefly about the love and desire of money, which are
    passions. Therefore liberality seems to belong to temperance rather than to
    justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it belongs chiefly to liberality to give
    becomingly, as stated (<a href="SS117.html#SSQ117A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).
    But giving becomingly belongs to beneficence and mercy, which pertain to
    charity, as state above (<a href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [30]</a
    >,31). Therefore liberality is a part of charity rather than of justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Offic. i): "Justice has to
    do with the fellowship of mankind. For the notion of fellowship is divided
    into two parts, justice and beneficence, also called liberality or
    kind-heartedness." Therefore liberality pertains to justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Liberality is not a species of justice, since
    justice pays another what is his whereas liberality gives another what is
    one's own. There are, however, two points in which it agrees with justice:
    first, that it is directed chiefly to another, as justice is; secondly, that
    it is concerned with external things, and so is justice, albeit under a
    different aspect, a stated in this Article and above (<a
      href="SS117.html#SSQ117A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, ad 3). Hence it is that liberality is reckoned by some to be a part of
    justice, being annexed thereto as to a principal virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although liberality does no consider the
    legal due that justice considers, it considers a certain moral due. This due
    is based on a certain fittingness and not on an obligation: so that it
    answers to the idea of due in the lowest degree.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Temperance is about concupiscence in
    pleasures of the body. But the concupiscence and delight in money is not
    referable to the body but rather to the soul. Hence liberality does not
    properly pertain to temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The giving of beneficence and mercy
    proceeds from the fact that a man has a certain affection towards the person
    to whom he gives: wherefore this giving belongs to charity or friendship.
    But the giving of liberality arises from a person being affected in a
    certain way towards money, in that he desires it not nor loves it: so that
    when it is fitting he gives it not only to his friends but also to those
    whom he knows not. Hence it belong not to charity, but to justice, which is
    about external things.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether liberality is the greatest of the virtues?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that liberality is the greatest of the
    virtues. For every virtue of man is a likeness to the divine goodness. Now
    man is likened chiefly by liberality to God, "Who giveth to all men
    abundantly, and upbraideth not" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+1%3A5"
      >James 1:5</a
    >). Therefore liberality is the greatest of the virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine (De Trin. vi, 8),
    "in things that are great, but not in bulk, to be greatest is to be best."
    Now the nature of goodness seems to pertain mostly to liberality, since "the
    good is self-communicative," according to Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv). Hence
    Ambrose says (De Offic. i) that "justice reclines to severity, liberality to
    goodness." Therefore liberality is the greatest of virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, men are honored and loved on account of
    virtue. Now Boethius says (De Consol. ii) that "bounty above all makes a man
    famous": and the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "among the virtuous
    the liberal are the most beloved." Therefore liberality is the greatest of
    virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Offic. i) that "justice
    seems to be more excellent than liberality, although liberality is more
    pleasing." The Philosopher also says (Rhet. i, 9) that "brave and just men
    are honored chiefly and, after them, those who are liberal."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Every virtue tends towards a good; wherefore
    the greater virtue is that which tends towards the greater good. Now
    liberality tends towards a good in two ways: in one way, primarily and of
    its own nature; in another way, consequently. Primarily and of its very
    nature it tends to set in order one's own affection towards the possession
    and use of money. In this way temperance, which moderates desires and
    pleasures relating to one's own body, takes precedence of liberality: and so
    do fortitude and justice, which, in a manner, are directed to the common
    good, one in time of peace, the other in time of war: while all these are
    preceded by those virtues which are directed to the Divine good. For the
    Divine good surpasses all manner of human good; and among human goods the
    public good surpasses the good of the individual; and of the last named the
    good of the body surpasses those goods that consist of external things.
    Again, liberality is ordained to a good consequently, and in this way it is
    directed to all the aforesaid goods. For by reason of his not being a lover
    of money, it follows that a man readily makes use of it, whether for
    himself. Or for the good of others, or for God's glory. Thus it derives a
    certain excellence from being useful in many ways. Since, however, we should
    judge of things according to that which is competent to them primarily and
    in respect of their nature, rather than according to that which pertains to
    them consequently, it remains to be said that liberality is not the greatest
    of virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God's giving proceeds from His love for
    those to whom He gives, not from His affection towards the things He gives,
    wherefore it seems to pertain to charity, the greatest of virtues, rather
    than to liberality.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Every virtue shares the nature of
    goodness by giving forth its own act: and the acts of certain other virtues
    are better than money which liberality gives forth.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The friendship whereby a liberal man is
    beloved is not that which is based on virtue, as though he were better than
    others, but that which is based on utility, because he is more useful in
    external goods, which as a rule men desire above all others. For the same
    reason he becomes famous.<br />
