  <h3 align="center">OF THE DIVISION OF PROPHECY (SIX ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the division of prophecy, and under this head there are
    six points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS174.html#SSQ174A1THEP1">(1)</a> The division of prophecy into its
    species;
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS174.html#SSQ174A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the more excellent
    prophecy is that which is without imaginative vision?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS174.html#SSQ174A3THEP1">(3)</a> The various degrees of prophecy;
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS174.html#SSQ174A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether Moses was the greatest of
    the prophets?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS174.html#SSQ174A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether a comprehensor can be a
    prophet?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS174.html#SSQ174A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether prophecy advanced in
    perfection as time went on?

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether prophecy is fittingly divided into the prophecy of divine
    predestination, of foreknowledge, and of denunciation?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prophecy is unfittingly
    divided according to a gloss on Mt. 1:23, "Behold a virgin shall be with
    child," where it is stated that "one kind of prophecy proceeds from the
    Divine predestination, and must in all respects be accomplished so that its
    fulfillment is independent of our will, for instance the one in question.
    Another prophecy proceeds from God's foreknowledge: and into this our will
    enters. And another prophecy is called denunciation, which is significative
    of God's disapproval." For that which results from every prophecy should not
    be reckoned a part of prophecy. Now all prophecy is according to the Divine
    foreknowledge, since the prophets "read in the book of foreknowledge," as a
    gloss says on Is. 38:1. Therefore it would seem that prophecy according to
    foreknowledge should not be reckoned a species of prophecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as something is foretold in
    denunciation, so is something foretold in promise, and both of these are
    subject to alteration. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++18%3A7,8"
      >Jer. 18:7,8</a
    >): "I will suddenly speak against a nation and against a kingdom, to root
    out, and to pull down, and to destroy it. If that nation against which I
    have spoken shall repent of their evil, I also will repent"---and this
    pertains to the prophecy of denunciation, and afterwards the text continues
    in reference to the prophecy of promise (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++18%3A9,10"
      >Jer. 18:9,10</a
    >): "I will suddenly speak of a nation and of a kingdom, to build up and
    plant it. If it shall do evil in My sight... I will repent of the good that
    I have spoken to do unto it." Therefore as there is reckoned to be a
    prophecy of denunciation, so should there be a prophecy of promise.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Isidore says (Etym. vii, 8): "There are
    seven kinds of prophecy. The first is an ecstasy, which is the transport of
    the mind: thus Peter saw a vessel descending from heaven with all manner of
    beasts therein. The second kind is a vision, as we read in Isaias, who says
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++6%3A1">Is. 6:1</a>): 'I
    saw the Lord sitting,' etc. The third kind is a dream: thus Jacob in a
    dream, saw a ladder. The fourth kind is from the midst of a cloud: thus God
    spake to Moses. The fifth kind is a voice from heaven, as that which called
    to Abraham saying (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++22%3A11"
      >Gn. 22:11</a
    >): 'Lay not thy hand upon the boy.' The sixth kind is taking up a parable,
    as in the example of Balaam (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Num++23%3A7;+24:15"
      >Num. 23:7; 24:15</a
    >). The seventh kind is the fullness of the Holy Ghost, as in the case of
    nearly all the prophets." Further, he mentions three kinds of vision; "one
    by the eyes of the body, another by the soul's imagination, a third by the
    eyes of the mind." Now these are not included in the aforesaid division.
    Therefore it is insufficient.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the authority of Jerome to whom the
    gloss above quoted is ascribed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The species of moral habits and acts are
    distinguished according to their objects. Now the object of prophecy is
    something known by God and surpassing the faculty of man. Wherefore,
    according to the difference of such things, prophecy is divided into various
    species, as assigned above. Now it has been stated above (<a
      href="SS071.html#SSQ71OUTP1"
      >Question [71]</a
    >, <a href="SS071.html#SSQ71A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 2) that the future
    is contained in the Divine knowledge in two ways. First, as in its cause:
    and thus we have the prophecy of "denunciation," which is not always
    fulfilled. but it foretells the relation of cause to effect, which is
    sometimes hindered by some other occurrence supervening. Secondly, God
    foreknows certain things in themselves---either as to be accomplished by
    Himself, and of such things is the prophecy of "predestination," since,
    according to Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 30), "God predestines things which
    are not in our power"---or as to be accomplished through man's free-will,
    and of such is the prophecy of "foreknowledge." This may regard either good
    or evil, which does not apply to the prophecy of predestination, since the
    latter regards good alone. And since predestination is comprised under
    foreknowledge, the gloss in the beginning of the Psalter assigns only two
    species to prophecy, namely of "foreknowledge," and of "denunciation."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Foreknowledge, properly speaking,
    denotes precognition of future events in themselves, and in this sense it is
    reckoned a species of prophecy. But in so far as it is used in connection
    with future events, whether as in themselves, or as in their causes, it is
    common to every species of prophecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The prophecy of promise is included in
    the prophecy of denunciation, because the aspect of truth is the same in
    both. But it is denominated in preference from denunciation, because God is
    more inclined to remit punishment than to withdraw promised blessings.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Isidore divides prophecy according to
    the manner of prophesying. Now we may distinguish the manner of
    prophesying---either according to man's cognitive powers, which are sense,
    imagination, and intellect, and then we have the three kinds of vision
    mentioned both by him and by Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xii, 6,7)---or
    according to the different ways in which the prophetic current is received.
    Thus as regards the enlightening of the intellect there is the "fullness of
    the Holy Ghost" which he mentions in the seventh place. As to the imprinting
    of pictures on the imagination he mentions three, namely "dreams," to which
    he gives the third place; "vision," which occurs to the prophet while awake
    and regards any kind of ordinary object, and this he puts in the second
    place; and "ecstasy," which results from the mind being uplifted to certain
    lofty things, and to this he assigns the first place. As regards sensible
    signs he reckons three kinds of prophecy, because a sensible sign
    is---either a corporeal thing offered externally to the sight, such as "a
    cloud," which he mentions in the fourth place---or a "voice" sounding from
    without and conveyed to man's hearing---this he puts in the fifth place---or
    a voice proceeding from a man, conveying something under a similitude, and
    this pertains to the "parable" to which he assigns the sixth place.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the prophecy which is accompanied by intellective and imaginative
    vision is more excellent than that which is accompanied by intellective
    vision alone?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the prophecy which has
    intellective and imaginative vision is more excellent than that which is
    accompanied by intellective vision alone. For Augustine says (Gen. ad lit.
    xii, 9): "He is less a prophet, who sees in spirit nothing but the signs
    representative of things, by means of the images of things corporeal: he is
    more a prophet, who is merely endowed with the understanding of these signs;
    but most of all is he a prophet, who excels in both ways," and this refers
    to the prophet who has intellective together with imaginative vision.
    Therefore this kind of prophecy is more excellent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the greater a thing's power is, the
    greater the distance to which it extends. Now the prophetic light pertains
    chiefly to the mind, as stated above (<a href="SS173.html#SSQ173OUTP1"
      >Question [173]</a
    >, <a href="SS173.html#SSQ173A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore apparently
    the prophecy that extends to the imagination is greater than that which is
    confined to the intellect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Jerome (Prol. in Lib. Reg.)
    distinguishes the "prophets" from the "sacred writers." Now all those whom
    he calls prophets (such as Isaias, Jeremias, and the like) had intellective
    together with imaginative vision: but not those whom he calls sacred
    writers, as writing by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost (such as Job,
    David, Solomon, and the like). Therefore it would seem more proper to call
    prophets those who had intellective together with imaginative vision, than
    those who had intellective vision alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. i) that "it
    is impossible for the Divine ray to shine on us, except as screened round
    about by the many-colored sacred veils." Now the prophetic revelation is
    conveyed by the infusion of the divine ray. Therefore it seems that it
    cannot be without the veils of phantasms.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss says at the beginning of the Psalter
    that "the most excellent manner of prophecy is when a man prophesies by the
    mere inspiration of the Holy Ghost, apart from any outward assistance of
    deed, word, vision, or dream."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The excellence of the means is measured chiefly
    by the end. Now the end of prophecy is the manifestation of a truth that
    surpasses the faculty of man. Wherefore the more effective this
    manifestation is, the more excellent the prophecy. But it is evident that
    the manifestation of divine truth by means of the bare contemplation of the
    truth itself, is more effective than that which is conveyed under the
    similitude of corporeal things, for it approaches nearer to the heavenly
    vision whereby the truth is seen in God's essence. Hence it follows that the
    prophecy whereby a supernatural truth is seen by intellectual vision, is
    more excellent than that in which a supernatural truth is manifested by
    means of the similitudes of corporeal things in the vision of the
    imagination.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover the prophet's mind is shown thereby to be more lofty: even as in
    human teaching the hearer, who is able to grasp the bare intelligible truth
    the master propounds, is shown to have a better understanding than one who
    needs to be taken by the hand and helped by means of examples taken from
    objects of sense. Hence it is said in commendation of David's prophecy (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Sam++23%3A3"
      >2 Kgs. 23:3</a
    >): "The strong one of Israel spoke to me," and further on (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Sam++23%3A4"
      >2 Kgs. 23:4</a
    >): "As the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, shineth in the
    morning without clouds."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When a particular supernatural truth has
    to be revealed by means of corporeal images, he that has both, namely the
    intellectual light and the imaginary vision, is more a prophet than he that
    has only one, because his prophecy is more perfect; and it is in this sense
    that Augustine speaks as quoted above. Nevertheless the prophecy in which
    the bare intelligible truth is revealed is greater than all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The same judgment does not apply to
    things that are sought for their own sake, as to things sought for the sake
    of something else. For in things sought for their own sake, the agent's
    power is the more effective according as it extends to more numerous and
    more remote objects; even so a physician is thought more of, if he is able
    to heal more people, and those who are further removed from health. on the
    other hand, in things sought only for the sake of something else, that agent
    would seem to have greater power, who is able to achieve his purpose with
    fewer means and those nearest to hand: thus more praise is awarded the
    physician who is able to heal a sick person by means of fewer and more
    gentle remedies. Now, in the prophetic knowledge, imaginary vision is
    required, not for its own sake, but on account of the manifestation of the
    intelligible truth. Wherefore prophecy is all the more excellent according
    as it needs it less.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The fact that a particular predicate is
    applicable to one thing and less properly to another, does not prevent this
    latter from being simply better than the former: thus the knowledge of the
    blessed is more excellent than the knowledge of the wayfarer, although faith
    is more properly predicated of the latter knowledge, because faith implies
    an imperfection of knowledge. In like manner prophecy implies a certain
    obscurity, and remoteness from the intelligible truth; wherefore the name of
    prophet is more properly applied to those who see by imaginary vision. And
    yet the more excellent prophecy is that which is conveyed by intellectual
    vision, provided the same truth be revealed in either case. If, however, the
    intellectual light be divinely infused in a person, not that he may know
    some supernatural things, but that he may be able to judge, with the
    certitude of divine truth, of things that can be known by human reason, such
    intellectual prophecy is beneath that which is conveyed by an imaginary
    vision leading to a supernatural truth. It was this kind of prophecy that
    all those had who are included in the ranks of the prophets, who moreover
    were called prophets for the special reason that they exercised the
    prophetic calling officially. Hence they spoke as God's representatives,
    saying to the people: "Thus saith the Lord": but not so the authors of the
    "sacred writings," several of whom treated more frequently of things that
    can be known by human reason, not in God's name, but in their own, yet with
    the assistance of the Divine light withal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In the present life the enlightenment by
    the divine ray is not altogether without any veil of phantasms, because
    according to his present state of life it is unnatural to man not to
    understand without a phantasm. Sometimes, however, it is sufficient to have
    phantasms abstracted in the usual way from the senses without any imaginary
    vision divinely vouchsafed, and thus prophetic vision is said to be without
    imaginary vision.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the degrees of prophecy can be distinguished according to the
    imaginary vision?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the degrees of prophecy cannot
    be distinguished according to the imaginary vision. For the degrees of a
    thing bear relation to something that is on its own account, not on account
    of something else. Now, in prophecy, intellectual vision is sought on its
    own account, and imaginary vision on account of something else, as stated
    above (<a href="SS174.html#SSQ174A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). Therefore
    it would seem that the degrees of prophecy are distinguished not according
    to imaginary, but only according to intellectual, vision.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, seemingly for one prophet there is one
    degree of prophecy. Now one prophet receives revelation through various
    imaginary visions. Therefore a difference of imaginary visions does not
    entail a difference of prophecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to a gloss [*Cassiodorus,
    super Prolog. Hieron. in Psalt.], prophecy consists of words, deeds, dreams,
    and visions. Therefore the degrees of prophecy should not be distinguished
    according to imaginary vision, to which vision and dreams pertain, rather
    than according to words and deeds.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The medium differentiates the degrees of
    knowledge: thus science based on direct [*"Propter quid"] proofs is more
    excellent than science based on indirect [*"Quia"] premises or than opinion,
    because it comes through a more excellent medium. Now imaginary vision is a
    kind of medium in prophetic knowledge. Therefore the degrees of prophecy
    should be distinguished according to imaginary vision.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS173.html#SSQ173OUTP1"
      >Question [173]</a
    >, <a href="SS173.html#SSQ173A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the prophecy
    wherein, by the intelligible light, a supernatural truth is revealed through
    an imaginary vision, holds the mean between the prophecy wherein a
    supernatural truth is revealed without imaginary vision, and that wherein
    through the intelligible light and without an imaginary vision, man is
    directed to know or do things pertaining to human conduct. Now knowledge is
    more proper to prophecy than is action; wherefore the lowest degree of
    prophecy is when a man, by an inward instinct, is moved to perform some
    outward action. Thus it is related of Samson (Judges 15:14) that "the Spirit
    of the Lord came strongly upon him, and as the flax [*'Lina.' St. Thomas
    apparently read 'ligna' ('wood')] is wont to be consumed at the approach of
    fire, so the bands with which he was bound were broken and loosed." The
    second degree of prophecy is when a man is enlightened by an inward light so
    as to know certain things, which, however, do not go beyond the bounds of
    natural knowledge: thus it is related of Solomon (3 Kgs. 4:32,33) that "he
    spoke... parables... and he treated about trees from the cedar that is in
    Libanus unto the hyssop that cometh out of the wall, and he discoursed of
    beasts and of fowls, and of creeping things and of fishes": and all of this
    came from divine inspiration, for it was stated previously (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Kgs++4%3A29"
      >3 Kgs. 4:29</a
    >): "God gave to Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Nevertheless these two degrees are beneath prophecy properly so called,
    because they do not attain to supernatural truth. The prophecy wherein
    supernatural truth is manifested through imaginary vision is differentiated
    first according to the difference between dreams which occur during sleep,
    and vision which occurs while one is awake. The latter belongs to a higher
    degree of prophecy, since the prophetic light that draws the soul away to
    supernatural things while it is awake and occupied with sensible things
    would seem to be stronger than that which finds a man's soul asleep and
    withdrawn from objects of sense. Secondly the degrees of this prophecy are
    differentiated according to the expressiveness of the imaginary signs
    whereby the intelligible truth is conveyed. And since words are the most
    expressive signs of intelligible truth, it would seem to be a higher degree
    of prophecy when the prophet, whether awake or asleep, hears words
    expressive of an intelligible truth, than when he sees things significative
    of truth, for instance "the seven full ears of corn" signified "seven years
    of plenty" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++41%3A22,26"
      >Gn. 41:22,26</a
    >). In such like signs prophecy would seem to be the more excellent,
    according as the signs are more expressive, for instance when Jeremias saw
    the burning of the city under the figure of a boiling cauldron (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++1%3A13"
      >Jer. 1:13</a
    >). Thirdly, it is evidently a still higher degree of prophecy when a
    prophet not only sees signs of words or deeds, but also, either awake or
    asleep, sees someone speaking or showing something to him, since this proves
    the prophet's mind to have approached nearer to the cause of the revelation.
    Fourthly, the height of a degree of prophecy may be measured according to
    the appearance of the person seen: for it is a higher degree of prophecy, if
    he who speaks or shows something to the waking or sleeping prophet be seen
    by him under the form of an angel, than if he be seen by him under the form
    of man: and higher still is it, if he be seen by the prophet whether asleep
    or awake, under the appearance of God, according to Is. 6:1, "I saw the Lord
    sitting."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But above all these degrees there is a third kind of prophecy, wherein an
    intelligible and supernatural truth is shown without any imaginary vision.
    However, this goes beyond the bounds of prophecy properly so called, as
    stated above (<a href="SS174.html#SSQ174A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3); and
    consequently the degrees of prophecy are properly distinguished according to
    imaginary vision.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We are unable to know how to distinguish
    the intellectual light, except by means of imaginary or sensible signs.
    Hence the difference in the intellectual light is gathered from the
    difference in the things presented to the imagination.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS171.html#SSQ171OUTP1"
      >Question [171]</a
    >, <a href="SS171.html#SSQ171A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), prophecy is by way,
    not of an abiding habit, but of a transitory passion; wherefore there is
    nothing inconsistent if one and the same prophet, at different times,
    receive various degrees of prophetic revelation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The words and deeds mentioned there do
    not pertain to the prophetic revelation, but to the announcement, which is
    made according to the disposition of those to whom that which is revealed to
    the prophet is announced; and this is done sometimes by words, sometimes by
    deeds. Now this announcement, and the working of miracles, are something
    consequent upon prophecy, as stated above (<a href="SS171.html#SSQ171OUTP1"

  <h3 align="left">Whether Moses was the greatest of the prophets?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Moses was not the greatest of
    the prophets. For a gloss at the beginning of the Psalter says that "David
    is called the prophet by way of excellence." Therefore Moses was not the
    greatest of all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, greater miracles were wrought by Josue,
    who made the sun and moon to stand still (Josue 10:12-14), and by Isaias,
    who made the sun to turn back (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++38%3A8"
      >Is. 38:8</a
    >), than by Moses, who divided the Red Sea (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++14%3A21"
      >Ex. 14:21</a
    >). In like manner greater miracles were wrought by Elias, of whom it is
    written (Ecclus. 48:4,5): "Who can glory like to thee? Who raisedst up a
    dead man from below." Therefore Moses was not the greatest of the
    prophets.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++11%3A11"
      >Mt. 11:11</a
    >) that "there hath not risen, among them that are born of women, a greater
    than John the Baptist." Therefore Moses was not greater than all the
    prophets.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++34%3A10"
      >Dt. 34:10</a
    >): "There arose no more a prophet in Israel like unto Moses."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Although in some respect one or other of the
    prophets was greater than Moses, yet Moses was simply the greatest of all.
    For, as stated above (<a href="SS174.html#SSQ174A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="SS171.html#SSQ171OUTP1">Question [171]</a>,
    <a href="SS171.html#SSQ171A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), in prophecy we may
    consider not only the knowledge, whether by intellectual or by imaginary
    vision, but also the announcement and the confirmation by miracles.
    Accordingly Moses was greater than the other prophets. First, as regards the
    intellectual vision, since he saw God's very essence, even as Paul in his
    rapture did, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xii, 27). Hence it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Num++12%3A8"
      >Num. 12:8</a
    >) that he saw God "plainly and not by riddles." Secondly, as regards the
    imaginary vision, which he had at his call, as it were, for not only did he
    hear words, but also saw one speaking to him under the form of God, and this
    not only while asleep, but even when he was awake. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++33%3A11"
      >Ex. 33:11</a
    >) that "the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a man is wont to speak to
    his friend." Thirdly, as regards the working of miracles which he wrought on
    a whole nation of unbelievers. Wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++34%3A10,11"
      >Dt. 34:10,11</a
    >): "There arose no more a prophet in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord
    knew face to face: in all the signs and wonders, which He sent by him, to do
    in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to his whole
    land."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The prophecy of David approaches near to
    the vision of Moses, as regards the intellectual vision, because both
    received a revelation of intelligible and supernatural truth, without any
    imaginary vision. Yet the vision of Moses was more excellent as regards the
    knowledge of the Godhead; while David more fully knew and expressed the
    mysteries of Christ's incarnation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> These signs of the prophets mentioned
    were greater as to the substance of the thing done; yet the miracles of
    Moses were greater as regards the way in which they were done, since they
    were wrought on a whole people.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> John belongs to the New Testament, whose
    ministers take precedence even of Moses, since they are spectators of a
    fuller revelation, as stated in 2 Cor. 3.<br />

    Whether there is a degree of prophecy in the blessed?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is a degree of prophecy
    in the blessed. For, as stated above (<a href="SS174.html#SSQ174A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >), Moses saw the Divine essence, and yet he is called a prophet. Therefore
    in like manner the blessed can be called prophets.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prophecy is a "divine revelation." Now
    divine revelations are made even to the blessed angels. Therefore even
    blessed angels can be prophets.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ was a comprehensor from the
    moment of His conception; and yet He calls Himself a prophet (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++13%3A57"
      >Mt. 13:57</a
    >), when He says: "A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country."
    Therefore even comprehensors and the blessed can be called prophets.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is written of Samuel (Ecclus. 46:23):
    "He lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy to blot out the
    wickedness of the nation." Therefore other saints can likewise be called
    prophets after they have died.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The prophetic word is compared (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Pt++1%3A19"
      >2 Pt. 1:19</a
    >) to a "light that shineth in a dark place." Now there is no darkness in
    the blessed. Therefore they cannot be called prophets.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Prophecy denotes vision of some supernatural
    truth as being far remote from us. This happens in two ways. First, on the
    part of the knowledge itself, because, to wit, the supernatural truth is not
    known in itself, but in some of its effects; and this truth will be more
    remote if it be known by means of images of corporeal things, than if it be
    known in its intelligible effects; and such most of all is the prophetic
    vision, which is conveyed by images and likenesses of corporeal things.
    Secondly, vision is remote on the part of the seer, because, to wit, he has
    not yet attained completely to his ultimate perfection, according to 2 Cor.
    5:6, "While we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now in neither of these ways are the blessed remote; wherefore they cannot
    be called prophets.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This vision of Moses was interrupted
    after the manner of a passion, and was not permanent like the beatific
    vision, wherefore he was as yet a seer from afar. For this reason his vision
    did not entirely lose the character of prophecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The divine revelation is made to the
    angels, not as being far distant, but as already wholly united to God;
    wherefore their revelation has not the character of prophecy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ was at the same time comprehensor
    and wayfarer [*Cf. TP, Questions [9], seqq.]. Consequently the notion of
    prophecy is not applicable to Him as a comprehensor, but only as a
    wayfarer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Samuel had not yet attained to the state
    of blessedness. Wherefore although by God's will the soul itself of Samuel
    foretold to Saul the issue of the war as revealed to him by God, this
    pertains to the nature of prophecy. It is not the same with the saints who
    are now in heaven. Nor does it make any difference that this is stated to
    have been brought about by the demons' art, because although the demons are
    unable to evoke the soul of a saint, or to force it to do any particular
    thing, this can be done by the power of God, so that when the demon is
    consulted, God Himself declares the truth by His messenger: even as He gave
    a true answer by Elias to the King's messengers who were sent to consult the
    god of Accaron (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Kgs++1"
      >4 Kgs. 1</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It might also be replied [*The Book of Ecclesiasticus was not as yet
    declared by the Church to be Canonical Scripture; Cf. FP, Question [89],
    Article [8], ad 2] that it was not the soul of Samuel, but a demon
    impersonating him; and that the wise man calls him Samuel, and describes his
    prediction as prophetic, in accordance with the thoughts of Saul and the
    bystanders who were of this opinion.<br />

    Whether the degrees of prophecy change as time goes on?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the degrees of prophecy change
    as time goes on. For prophecy is directed to the knowledge of Divine things,
    as stated above (<a href="SS174.html#SSQ174A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now
    according to Gregory (Hom. in Ezech.), "knowledge of God went on increasing
    as time went on." Therefore degrees of prophecy should be distinguished
    according to the process of time.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prophetic revelation is conveyed by God
    speaking to man; while the prophets declared both in words and in writing
    the things revealed to them. Now it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Sam++3%3A1"
      >1 Kgs. 3:1</a
    >) that before the time of Samuel "the word of the Lord was precious," i.e.
    rare; and yet afterwards it was delivered to many. In like manner the books
    of the prophets do not appear to have been written before the time of
    Isaias, to whom it was said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++8%3A1"
      >Is. 8:1</a
    >): "Take thee a great book and write in it with a man's pen," after which
    many prophets wrote their prophecies. Therefore it would seem that in course
    of time the degree of prophecy made progress.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++11%3A13"
      >Mt. 11:13</a
    >): "The prophets and the law prophesied until John"; and afterwards the
    gift of prophecy was in Christ's disciples in a much more excellent manner
    than in the prophets of old, according to Eph. 3:5, "In other generations"
    the mystery of Christ "was not known to the sons of men, as it is now
    revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit." Therefore it
    would seem that in course of time the degree of prophecy advanced.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS174.html#SSQ174A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >), Moses was the greatest of the prophets, and yet he preceded the other
    prophets. Therefore prophecy did not advance in degree as time went on.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS174.html#SSQ174A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), prophecy is directed to the knowledge of Divine truth, by the
    contemplation of which we are not only instructed in faith, but also guided
    in our actions, according to Ps. 42:3, "Send forth Thy light and Thy truth:
    they have conducted me." Now our faith consists chiefly in two things:
    first, in the true knowledge of God, according to Heb. 11:6, "He that cometh
    to God must believe that He is"; secondly, in the mystery of Christ's
    incarnation, according to Jn. 14:1, "You believe in God, believe also in
    Me." Accordingly, if we speak of prophecy as directed to the Godhead as its
    end, it progressed according to three divisions of time, namely before the
    law, under the law, and under grace. For before the law, Abraham and the
    other patriarchs were prophetically taught things pertinent to faith in the
    Godhead. Hence they are called prophets, according to Ps. 104:15, "Do no
    evil to My prophets," which words are said especially on behalf of Abraham
    and Isaac. Under the Law prophetic revelation of things pertinent to faith
    in the Godhead was made in a yet more excellent way than hitherto, because
    then not only certain special persons or families but the whole people had
    to be instructed in these matters. Hence the Lord said to Moses (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++6%3A2,3"
      >Ex. 6:2,3</a
    >): "I am the Lord that appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the
    name of God almighty, and My name Adonai I did not show to them"; because
    previously the patriarchs had been taught to believe in a general way in
    God, one and Almighty, while Moses was more fully instructed in the
    simplicity of the Divine essence, when it was said to him (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++3%3A14"
      >Ex. 3:14</a
    >): "I am Who am"; and this name is signified by Jews in the word "Adonai"
    on account of their veneration for that unspeakable name. Afterwards in the
    time of grace the mystery of the Trinity was revealed by the Son of God
    Himself, according to Mt. 28:19: "Going... teach ye all nations, baptizing
    them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    In each state, however, the most excellent revelation was that which was
    given first. Now the first revelation, before the Law, was given to Abraham,
    for it was at that time that men began to stray from faith in one God by
    turning aside to idolatry, whereas hitherto no such revelation was necessary
    while all persevered in the worship of one God. A less excellent revelation
    was made to Isaac, being founded on that which was made to Abraham.
    Wherefore it was said to him (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++26%3A24"
      >Gn. 26:24</a
    >): "I am the God of Abraham thy father," and in like manner to Jacob (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++28%3A13"
      >Gn. 28:13</a
    >): "I am the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac." Again in the
    state of the Law the first revelation which was given to Moses was more
    excellent, and on this revelation all the other revelations to the prophets
    were founded. And so, too, in the time of grace the entire faith of the
    Church is founded on the revelation vouchsafed to the apostles, concerning
    the faith in one God and three Persons, according to Mt. 16:18, "On this
    rock," i.e. of thy confession, "I will build My Church."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As to the faith in Christ's incarnation, it is evident that the nearer men
    were to Christ, whether before or after Him, the more fully, for the most
    part, were they instructed on this point, and after Him more fully than
    before, as the Apostle declares (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++3%3A5"
      >Eph. 3:5</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As regards the guidance of human acts, the prophetic revelation varied not
    according to the course of time, but according as circumstances required,
    because as it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++29%3A18"
      >Prov. 29:18</a
    >), "When prophecy shall fail, the people shall be scattered abroad."
    Wherefore at all times men were divinely instructed about what they were to
    do, according as it was expedient for the spiritual welfare of the elect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The saying of Gregory is to be referred
    to the time before Christ's incarnation, as regards the knowledge of this
    mystery.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xviii,
    27), "just as in the early days of the Assyrian kingdom promises were made
    most explicitly to Abraham, so at the outset of the western Babylon," which
    is Rome, "and under its sway Christ was to come, in Whom were to be
    fulfilled the promises made through the prophetic oracles testifying in word
    and writing to that great event to come," the promises, namely, which were
    made to Abraham. "For while prophets were scarcely ever lacking to the
    people of Israel from the time that they began to have kings, it was
    exclusively for their benefit, not for that of the nations. But when those
    prophetic writings were being set up with greater publicity, which at some
    future time were to benefit the nations, it was fitting to begin when this
    city," Rome to wit, "was being built, which was to govern the nations."<br />

    The reason why it behooved that nation to have a number of prophets
    especially at the time of the kings, was that then it was not over-ridden by
    other nations, but had its own king; wherefore it behooved the people, as
    enjoying liberty, to have prophets to teach them what to do.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The prophets who foretold the coming of
    Christ could not continue further than John, who with his finger pointed to
    Christ actually present. Nevertheless as Jerome says on this passage, "This
    does not mean that there were no more prophets after John. For we read in
    the Acts of the apostles that Agabus and the four maidens, daughters of
    Philip, prophesied." John, too, wrote a prophetic book about the end of the
    Church; and at all times there have not been lacking persons having the
    spirit of prophecy, not indeed for the declaration of any new doctrine of
    faith, but for the direction of human acts. Thus Augustine says (De Civ. Dei
    v, 26) that "the emperor Theodosius sent to John who dwelt in the Egyptian
    desert, and whom he knew by his ever-increasing fame to be endowed with the
    prophetic spirit: and from him he received a message assuring him of
    victory."<br />
