    OF THE PRECEPTS RELATING TO PRUDENCE (TWO ARTICLES)<br />

  <p>
    We must now consider the precepts relating to prudence, under which head
    there are two points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS056.html#SSQ56A1THEP1">(1)</a> The precepts of prudence;</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS056.html#SSQ56A2THEP1">(2)</a> The precepts relating to the
    opposite vices.

    Whether the precepts of the decalogue should have included a precept of
    prudence?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the precepts of the decalogue
    should have included a precept of prudence. For the chief precepts should
    include a precept of the chief virtue. Now the chief precepts are those of
    the decalogue. Since then prudence is the chief of the moral virtues, it
    seems that the precepts of the decalogue should have included a precept of
    prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the teaching of the Gospel contains the
    Law especially with regard to the precepts of the decalogue. Now the
    teaching of the Gospel contains a precept of prudence (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++10%3A16"
      >Mt. 10:16</a
    >): "Be ye... prudent [Douay: 'wise'] as serpents." Therefore the precepts
    of the decalogue should have included a precept of prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the other lessons of the Old Testament
    are directed to the precepts of the decalogue: wherefore it is written
    (Malach. 4:4): "Remember the law of Moses My servant, which I commanded him
    in Horeb." Now the other lessons of the Old Testament include precepts of
    prudence; for instance (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++3%3A5"
      >Prov. 3:5</a
    >): "Lean not upon thy own prudence"; and further on (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++4%3A25"
      >Prov. 4:25</a
    >): "Let thine eyelids go before thy steps." Therefore the Law also should
    have contained a precept of prudence, especially among the precepts of the
    decalogue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The contrary however appears to anyone who goes through the precepts of the
    decalogue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS100.html#FSQ100OUTP1">Question [100]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS100.html#FSQ100A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="../FS/FS100.html#FSQ100A3A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 1) when we
    were treating of precepts, the commandments of the decalogue being given to
    the whole people, are a matter of common knowledge to all, as coming under
    the purview of natural reason. Now foremost among the things dictated by
    natural reason are the ends of human life, which are to the practical order
    what naturally known principles are to the speculative order, as shown above
    (<a href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>,
    <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Now prudence is not
    about the end, but about the means, as stated above (<a
      href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1"
      >Question [47]</a
    >, <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Hence it was not
    fitting that the precepts of the decalogue should include a precept relating
    directly to prudence. And yet all the precepts of the decalogue are related
    to prudence, in so far as it directs all virtuous acts.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although prudence is simply foremost
    among all the moral virtues, yet justice, more than any other virtue,
    regards its object under the aspect of something due, which is a necessary
    condition for a precept, as stated above (<a href="SS044.html#SSQ44OUTP1"
      >Question [44]</a
    >, <a href="SS044.html#SSQ44A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS099.html#FSQ99OUTP1">Question [99]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS099.html#FSQ99ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,5). Hence it
    behooved the chief precepts of the Law, which are those of the decalogue, to
    refer to justice rather than to prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The teaching of the Gospel is the
    doctrine of perfection. Therefore it needed to instruct man perfectly in all
    matters relating to right conduct, whether ends or means: wherefore it
    behooved the Gospel teaching to contain precepts also of prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as the rest of the teaching of the
    Old Testament is directed to the precepts of the decalogue as its end, so it
    behooved man to be instructed by the subsequent lessons of the Old Testament
    about the act of prudence which is directed to the means.<br />

    Whether the prohibitive precepts relating to the vices opposed to prudence
    are fittingly propounded in the Old Law?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the prohibitive precepts
    relating to the vices opposed to prudence are unfittingly propounded in the
    Old Law. For such vices as imprudence and its parts which are directly
    opposed to prudence are not less opposed thereto, than those which bear a
    certain resemblance to prudence, such as craftiness and vices connected with
    it. Now the latter vices are forbidden in the Law: for it is written (Lev.
    19:13): "Thou shalt not calumniate thy neighbor," and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++25%3A13"
      >Dt. 25:13</a
    >): "Thou shalt not have divers weights in thy bag, a greater and a less."
    Therefore there should have also been prohibitive precepts about the vices
    directly opposed to prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is room for fraud in other things
    than in buying and selling. Therefore the Law unfittingly forbade fraud
    solely in buying and selling.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there is the same reason for prescribing
    an act of virtue as for prohibiting the act of a contrary vice. But acts of
    prudence are not prescribed in the Law. Therefore neither should any
    contrary vices have been forbidden in the Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The contrary, however, appears from the precepts of the Law which are quoted
    in the first objection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS056.html#SSQ56A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), justice, above all, regards the aspect of something due, which is a
    necessary condition for a precept, because justice tends to render that
    which is due to another, as we shall state further on (<a
      href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1"
      >Question [58]</a
    >, <a href="SS058.html#SSQ58A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now craftiness, as to
    its execution, is committed chiefly in matters of justice, as stated above
    (<a href="SS055.html#SSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>,
    <a href="SS055.html#SSQ55A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>): and so it was fitting
    that the Law should contain precepts forbidding the execution of craftiness,
    in so far as this pertains to injustice, as when a man uses guile and fraud
    in calumniating another or in stealing his goods.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Those vices that are manifestly opposed
    to prudence, do not pertain to injustice in the same way as the execution of
    craftiness, and so they are not forbidden in the Law, as fraud and guile
    are, which latter pertain to injustice<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All guile and fraud committed in matters
    of injustice, can be understood to be forbidden in the prohibition of
    calumny (Lev. 19:13). Yet fraud and guile are wont to be practiced chiefly
    in buying and selling, according to Ecclus. 26:28, "A huckster shall not be
    justified from the sins of the lips": and it is for this reason that the Law
    contained a special precept forbidding fraudulent buying and selling.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All the precepts of the Law that relate
    to acts of justice pertain to the execution of prudence, even as the
    precepts prohibitive of stealing, calumny and fraudulent selling pertain to
    the execution of craftiness.<br />
