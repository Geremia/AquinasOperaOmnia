<H3 Align="Left">Whether idolatry is rightly reckoned a species of superstition?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that idolatry is not rightly reckoned a species of 
superstition. Just as heretics are unbelievers, so are idolaters. But 
heresy is a species of unbelief, as stated above (<A Href="SS011.html#SSQ11OUTP1">Question [11]</a>, <A Href="SS011.html#SSQ11A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore 
idolatry is also a species of unbelief and not of superstition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, latria pertains to the virtue of religion to which 
superstition is opposed. But latria, apparently, is univocally applied to 
idolatry and to that which belongs to the  true religion. For just as we 
speak univocally of the desire of false happiness, and of the desire of 
true happiness, so too, seemingly, we speak univocally of the worship of 
false gods, which is called idolatry, and of the worship of the true God, 
which is the latria of true religion. Therefore idolatry is not a species 
of superstition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which is nothing cannot be the species of any 
genus. But idolatry, apparently, is nothing: for the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++8%3A4">1 Cor. 8:4</a>): "We know that an idol is nothing in the world," and further on (1 
Cor. 10:19): "What then? Do I say that what is offered in sacrifice to 
idols is anything? Or that the idol is anything?" implying an answer in 
the negative. Now offering things to idols belongs properly to idolatry. 
Therefore since idolatry is like to nothing, it cannot be a species of 
superstition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it belongs to superstition to give divine honor to whom 
that honor is not due. Now divine honor is undue to idols, just as it is 
undue to other creatures, wherefore certain people are reproached (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A25">Rm. 1:25</a>) for that they "worshipped and served the creature rather than the 
Creator." Therefore this species of superstition is unfittingly called 
idolatry, and should rather be named "worship of creatures."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is related (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+17%3A16">Acts 17:16</a>) that when Paul awaited Silas 
and Timothy at Athens, "his spirit was stirred within him seeing the 
whole city given to idolatry," and further on (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+17%3A22">Acts 17:22</a>) he says: "Ye 
men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious." 
Therefore idolatry belongs to superstition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS092.html#SSQ92OUTP1">Question [92]</a>, <A Href="SS092.html#SSQ92A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it belongs to superstition 
to exceed the due mode of divine worship, and this is done chiefly when 
divine worship is given to whom it should not be given. Now it should be 
given to the most high uncreated God alone, as stated above (<A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) 
when we were treating of religion. Therefore it is superstition to give 
worship to any creature whatsoever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now just as this divine worship was given to sensible creatures by means 
of sensible signs, such as sacrifices, games, and the like, so too was it 
given to a creature represented by some sensible form or shape, which is 
called an "idol." Yet divine worship was given to idols in various ways. 
For some, by means of a nefarious art, constructed images which produced 
certain effects by the power of the demons: wherefore they deemed that 
the images themselves contained something God-like, and consequently that 
divine worship was due to them. This was the opinion of Hermes 
Trismegistus [*De Natura Deorum, ad Asclep], as Augustine states (De Civ. 
Dei viii, 23): while others gave divine worship not to the images, but to 
the creatures represented thereby. The Apostle alludes to both of these 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++1%3A23,25">Rm. 1:23,25</a>). For, as regards the former, he says: "They changed the 
glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of a 
corruptible man, and of birds, and of  four-footed beasts, and of 
creeping things," and of the latter he says: "Who worshipped and served 
the creature rather than the Creator."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; These latter were of three ways of thinking. For some deemed certain men 
to have been gods, whom they worshipped in the images of those men: for 
instance, Jupiter, Mercury, and so forth. Others again deemed the whole 
world to be one god, not by reason of its material substance, but by 
reason of its soul, which they believed to be God, for they held God to 
be nothing else than a soul governing the world by movement and reason: 
even as a man is said to be wise in respect not of his body but of his 
soul. Hence they thought that divine worship ought to be given to the 
whole world and to all its parts, heaven, air, water, and to all such 
things: and to these they referred the names of their gods, as Varro 
asserted, and Augustine relates (De Civ. Dei vii, 5). Lastly, others, 
namely, the Platonists, said that there is one supreme god, the cause of 
all things. After him they placed certain spiritual substances created by 
the supreme god. These they called "gods," on account of their having a 
share of the godhead; but we call them "angels." After these they placed 
the souls of the heavenly bodies, and beneath these the demons which they 
stated to be certain animal denizens of the air, and beneath these again 
they placed human souls, which they believed to be taken up into the 
fellowship of the gods or of the demons by reason of the merit of their 
virtue. To all these they gave divine worship, as Augustine relates (De 
Civ . . Dei xviii, 14).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The last two opinions were held to belong to "natural theology" which 
the philosophers gathered from their study of the world and taught in the 
schools: while the other, relating to the worship of men, was said to 
belong to "mythical theology" which was wont to be represented on the 
stage according to the fancies of poets. The remaining opinion relating 
to images was held to belong to "civil theology," which was celebrated by 
the pontiffs in the temples [*De Civ. Dei vi, 5].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all these come under the head of the superstition of idolatry. 
Wherefore Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 20): "Anything invented 
by man for making and worshipping idols, or for giving Divine worship to 
a creature or any part of a creature, is superstitious."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as religion is not faith, but a confession of faith by 
outward signs, so superstition is a confession of unbelief by external 
worship. Such a confession is signified by the term idolatry, but not by 
the term heresy, which only means a false opinion. Therefore heresy is a 
species of unbelief, but idolatry is a species of superstition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The term latria may be taken in two senses. In one sense it 
may denote a human act pertaining to the worship of God: and then its 
signification remains the same, to whomsoever it be shown, because, in 
this sense, the thing to which it is shown is  not included in its 
definition. Taken thus latria is applied univocally, whether to true 
religion or to idolatry, just as the payment of a tax is univocally the 
same, whether it is paid to the true or to a false king. In another sense 
latria denotes the same as religion, and then, since it is a virtue, it 
is essential thereto that divine worship be given to whom it ought to be 
given; and in this way latria is applied equivocally to the latria of 
true religion, and to idolatry: just as prudence is applied equivocally 
to the prudence that is a virtue, and to that which is carnal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The saying of the Apostle that "an idol is nothing in the 
world" means that those images which were called idols, were not 
animated, or possessed of a divine power, as Hermes maintained, as though 
they were composed of spirit and body. In the same sense we must 
understand the saying that "what is offered in sacrifice to idols is not 
anything," because by being thus sacrificed the sacrificial flesh 
acquired neither sanctification, as the Gentiles thought, nor 
uncleanness, as the Jews held.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> It was owing to the general custom among the Gentiles of 
worshipping any kind of creature under the form of images that the term 
"idolatry" was used to signify any worship of a creature, even without 
the use of images.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether idolatry is a sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that idolatry is not a sin. Nothing is a sin that 
the true faith employs in worshipping God. Now the true faith employs 
images for the divine worship: since both in the Tabernacle were there 
images of the cherubim, as related in Ex. 25, and in the Church are 
images set up which the faithful worship. Therefore idolatry, whereby 
idols are worshipped, is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, reverence should be paid to every superior. But the 
angels and the souls of the blessed are our superiors. Therefore it will 
be no sin to pay them reverence by worship, of sacrifices or the like.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the most high God should be honored with an inward 
worship, according to Jn. 4:24, "God . . . they must adore . . . in 
spirit and in truth": and Augustine says (Enchiridion iii), that "God is 
worshipped by faith, hope and charity." Now a man may happen to worship 
idols outwardly, and yet not wander from the true faith inwardly. 
Therefore it seems that we may worship idols outwardly without prejudice 
to the divine worship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++20%3A5">Ex. 20:5</a>): "Thou shalt not adore them," 
i.e. outwardly, "nor serve them," i.e. inwardly, as a gloss explains it: 
and it is a question of graven things and images. Therefore it is a sin 
to worship idols whether outwardly or inwardly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[2] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There has been a twofold error in this matter.  For some 
[*The School of Plato] have thought that to offer sacrifices and other 
things pertaining to latria, not only to God but also to the others 
aforesaid, is due and good in itself, since they held that divine honor 
should be paid to every superior nature, as being nearer to God. But this 
is unreasonable. For though we ought to revere all superiors, yet the 
same reverence is not due to them all: and something special is due to 
the most high God Who excels all in a singular manner: and this is the 
worship of latria.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[2] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor can it be said, as some have maintained, that "these visible 
sacrifices are fitting with regard to other gods, and that to the most 
high God, as being better than those others, better sacrifices, namely, 
the service of a pure mind, should be offered" [*Augustine, as quoted 
below]. The reason is that, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x, 19), 
"external sacrifices are signs of internal, just as audible words are 
signs of things. Wherefore, just as by prayer and praise we utter 
significant words to Him, and offer to Him in our hearts the things they 
signify, so too in our sacrifices we ought to realize that we should 
offer a visible sacrifice to no other than to Him Whose invisible 
sacrifice we ourselves should be in our hearts."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[2] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Others held that the outward worship of latria should be given to idols, 
not as though it were something good or fitting in itself, but as being 
in harmony with the general custom. Thus Augustine (De Civ. Dei vi, 10) 
quotes Seneca as saying: "We shall adore," says he, "in such a way as to 
remember that our worship ss in accordance with custom rather than with 
the reality": and (De Vera Relig. v) Augustine says that "we must not 
seek religion from the philosophers, who accepted the same things for 
sacred, as did the people; and gave utterance in the schools to various 
and contrary opinions about the nature of their gods, and the sovereign 
good." This error was embraced also by certain heretics [*The 
Helcesaitae], who affirmed that it is not wrong for one who is seized in 
time of persecution to worship idols outwardly so long as he keeps the 
faith in his heart.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[2] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is evidently false. For since outward worship is a sign of the 
inward worship, just as it is a wicked lie to affirm the contrary of what 
one holds inwardly of the true faith so too is it a wicked falsehood to 
pay outward worship to anything counter to the sentiments of one's heart. 
Wherefore Augustine condemns Seneca (De Civ. Dei vi, 10) in that "his 
worship of idols was so much the more infamous forasmuch as the things he 
did dishonestly were so done by him that the people believed him to act 
honestly."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Neither in the Tabernacle or Temple of the Old Law, nor 
again now in the Church are images set up that the worship of latria may 
be paid to them, but for the purpose of signification, in order that 
belief in the excellence of angels and saints may be impressed and 
confirmed in the mind of man. It is different with the image of Christ, 
to which latria is due on account of His Divinity, as we shall state in 
the TP, Question [25], Article [3].

<H3 Align="Left">Whether idolatry is the gravest of sins?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that idolatry is not the gravest of sins. The worst 
is opposed to the best (Ethic. viii, 10). But interior worship, which 
consists of faith, hope and charity, is better than external worship. 
Therefore unbelief, despair and hatred of God, which are opposed to 
internal worship, are graver sins than idolatry, which is opposed to 
external worship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the more a sin is against God the more grievous it is. 
Now, seemingly, a man acts more directly against God by blaspheming, or 
denying the faith, than by giving God's worship to another, which 
pertains to idolatry. Therefore blasphemy and denial of the faith are 
more grievous sins than idolatry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it seems that lesser evils are punished with greater 
evils. But the sin of idolatry was punished with the sin against nature, 
as stated in Rm. 1:26. Therefore the sin against nature is a graver sin 
than idolatry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Contra Faust. xx, 5): "Neither do we say 
that you," viz. the Manichees, "are pagans, or a sect of pagans, but that 
you bear a certain likeness to them since you worship many gods: and yet 
you are much worse than they are, for they worship things that exist, but 
should not be worshiped as gods, whereas you worship things that exist 
not at all." Therefore the vice of heretical depravity is more grievous 
than idolatry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, a gloss of Jerome on Gal. 4:9, "How turn you again to 
the weak and needy elements?" says: "The observance of the Law, to which 
they were then addicted, was a sin almost equal to the worship of idols, 
to which they had been given before their conversion." Therefore idolatry 
is not the most grievous sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on the saying of Lev. 15:25, about the 
uncleanness of a woman suffering from an issue of blood, says: "Every sin 
is an uncleanness of the soul, but especially idolatry."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The gravity of a sin may be considered in two ways. 
First, on the part of the sin itself, and thus idolatry is the most 
grievous sin. For just as the most heinous crime in an earthly 
commonwealth would seem to be for a man to give royal honor to another 
than the true king, since, so far as he is concerned, he disturbs the 
whole order of the commonwealth, so, in sins that are committed against 
God, which indeed are the greater sins, the greatest of all seems to be 
for a man to give God's honor to a creature, since, so far as he is 
concerned, he sets up another God in the world, and lessens the divine 
sovereignty. Secondly, the gravity of a sin may be considered on the part 
of the sinner. Thus  the sin of one that sins knowingly is said to be 
graver than the sin of one that sins through ignorance: and in this way 
nothing hinders heretics, if they knowingly corrupt the faith which they 
have received, from sinning more grievously than idolaters who sin 
through ignorance. Furthermore other sins may be more grievous on account 
of greater contempt on the part of the sinner.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Idolatry presupposes internal unbelief, and to this it adds 
undue worship. But in a case of external idolatry without internal 
unbelief, there is an additional sin of falsehood, as stated above (<A Href="SS094.html#SSQ94A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Idolatry includes a grievous blasphemy, inasmuch as it 
deprives God of the singleness of His dominion and denies the faith by 
deeds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since it is essential to punishment that it be against the 
will, a sin whereby another sin is punished needs to be more manifest, in 
order that it may make the man more hateful to himself and to others; but 
it need not be a more grievous sin: and in this way the sin against 
nature is less grievous than the sin of idolatry. But since it is more 
manifest, it is assigned as a fitting punishment of the sin of idolatry, 
in order that, as by idolatry man abuses the order of the divine honor, 
so by the sin against nature he may suffer confusion from the abuse of 
his own nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Even as to the genus of the sin, the Manichean heresy is 
more grievous than the sin of other idolaters, because it is more 
derogatory to the divine honor, since they set up two gods in opposition 
to one another, and hold many vain and fabulous fancies about God. It is 
different with other heretics, who confess their belief in one God and 
worship Him alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The observance of the Law during the time of grace is not 
quite equal to idolatry as to the genus of the sin, but almost equal, 
because both are species of pestiferous superstition.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the cause of idolatry was on the part of man?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the cause of idolatry was not on the part of 
man. In man there is nothing but either nature, virtue, or guilt. But the 
cause of idolatry could not be on the part of man's nature, since rather 
does man's natural reason dictate that there is one God, and that divine 
worship should not be paid to the dead or to inanimate beings. Likewise, 
neither could idolatry have its cause in man on the part of virtue, since 
"a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit," according to Mt. 7:18: nor 
again could it be on the part of guilt, because, according to Wis. 14:27, 
"the worship of abominable idols is the cause and the beginning and end 
of all evil." Therefore idolatry has no cause on the part of man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those things which have a cause in man are found among 
men at all times. Now idolatry was not always, but is stated [*Peter 
Comestor, Hist. Genes. xxxvii, xl] to have been originated either by 
Nimrod, who is related to have forced men to worship fire, or by Ninus, 
who caused the statue of his father Bel to be worshiped. Among the 
Greeks, as related by Isidore (Etym. viii, 11), Prometheus was the first 
to set up statues of men: and the Jews say that Ismael was the first to 
make idols of clay. Moreover, idolatry ceased to a great extent in the 
sixth age. Therefore idolatry had no cause on the part of man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 6): "It was not 
possible to learn, for the first time, except from their" (i.e. the 
demons') "teaching, what each of them desired or disliked, and by what 
name to invite or compel him: so as to give birth to the magic arts and 
their professors": and the same observation seems to apply to idolatry. 
Therefore idolatry had no cause on the part of man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Wis. 14:14): "By the vanity of men 
they," i.e. idols, "came into the world."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Idolatry had a twofold cause. One was a dispositive 
cause; this was on the part of man, and in three ways. First, on account 
of his inordinate affections, forasmuch as he gave other men divine 
honor, through either loving or revering them too much. This cause is 
assigned (Wis. 14:15): "A father being afflicted with bitter grief, made 
to himself the image of his son, who was quickly taken away: and him who 
then had died as a man he began to worship as a god." The same passage 
goes on to say (Wis. 14:21) that "men serving either their affection, or 
their kings, gave the incommunicable name [Vulg.: 'names']," i.e. of the 
Godhead, "to stones and wood." Secondly, because man takes a natural 
pleasure in representations, as the Philosopher observes (Poet. iv), 
wherefore as soon as the uncultured man saw human images skillfully 
fashioned by the diligence of the craftsman, he gave them divine worship; 
hence it is written (Wis. 13:11-17): "If an artist, a carpenter, hath cut 
down a tree, proper for his use, in the wood . . . and by the skill of 
his art fashioneth it, and maketh it like the image of a man . . . and 
then maketh prayer to it, inquiring concerning his substance, and his 
children, or his marriage." Thirdly, on account of their ignorance of the 
true God, inasmuch as through failing to consider His excellence men gave 
divine worship to certain creatures, on account of their beauty or power, 
wherefore it is written (Wis. 13:1,2): "All men . . . neither by 
attending to the works have acknowledged who was the workman, but have 
imagined either the fire, or the wind, or the swift air, or the circle of 
the stars, or the great water, or the sun and the moon, to be the gods 
that rule the world."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other cause of idolatry was completive, and this was on the part of 
the demons, who offered themselves to be worshipped by men, by giving 
answers in the idols, and doing things which to men seemed marvelous. 
Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++95%3A5">Ps. 95:5</a>): "All the gods of  the Gentiles are 
devils."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The dispositive cause of idolatry was, on the part of man, 
a defect of nature, either through ignorance in his intellect, or 
disorder in his affections, as stated above; and this pertains to guilt. 
Again, idolatry is stated to be the cause, beginning and end of all sin, 
because there is no kind of sin that idolatry does not produce at some 
time, either through leading expressly to that sin by causing it, or 
through being an occasion thereof, either as a beginning or as an end, in 
so far as certain sins were employed in the worship of idols; such as 
homicides, mutilations, and so forth. Nevertheless certain sins may 
precede idolatry and dispose man thereto.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There was no idolatry in the first age, owing to the recent 
remembrance of the creation of the world, so that man still retained in 
his mind the knowledge of one God. In the sixth age idolatry was banished 
by the doctrine and power of Christ, who triumphed over the devil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[94] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers the consummative cause of idolatry.
