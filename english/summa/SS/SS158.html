</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it cannot be lawful to be angry. For Jerome in 
his exposition on Mt. 5:22, "Whosoever is angry with his brother," etc. 
says: "Some codices add 'without cause.' However, in the genuine codices 
the sentence is unqualified, and anger is forbidden altogether." 
Therefore it is nowise lawful to be angry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv) "The soul's evil 
is to be without reason." Now anger is always without reason: for the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 6) that "anger does not listen perfectly to 
reason"; and Gregory says (Moral. v, 45) that "when anger sunders the 
tranquil surface of the soul, it mangles and rends it by its riot"; and 
Cassian says (De Inst. Caenob. viii, 6): "From whatever cause it arises, 
the angry passion boils over and blinds the eye of the mind." Therefore 
it is always evil to be angry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, anger is "desire for vengeance" [*Aristotle, Rhet. ii, 
2] according to a gloss on Lev. 19:17, "Thou shalt not hate thy brother 
in thy heart." Now it would seem unlawful to desire vengeance, since this 
should be left to God, according to Dt. 32:35, "Revenge is Mine." 
Therefore it would seem that to be angry is always an evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, all that makes us depart from likeness to God is evil. 
Now anger always makes us depart from likeness to God, since God judges 
with tranquillity according to Wis. 12:18. Therefore to be angry is 
always an evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Chrysostom [*Hom. xi in the Opus Imperfectum, falsely 
ascribed to St. John Chrysostom] says: "He that is angry without cause, 
shall be in danger; but he that is angry with cause, shall not be in 
danger: for without anger, teaching will be useless, judgments unstable, 
crimes unchecked." Therefore to be angry is not always an evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Properly speaking anger is a passion of the sensitive 
appetite, and gives its name to the irascible power, as stated above (FS, 
Question [46], Article [1]) when we were treating of the passions. Now with regard to 
the passions of the soul, it is to be observed that evil may be found in 
them in two ways. First by reason of the passion's very species, which is 
derived from the passion's object. Thus envy, in respect of its species, 
denotes an evil, since it is displeasure at another's good, and such 
displeasure is in itself contrary to reason: wherefore, as the 
Philosopher remarks (Ethic. ii, 6), "the very mention of envy denotes 
something evil." Now this does not apply to anger, which is the desire 
for revenge, since revenge may be desired both well and ill. Secondly, 
evil is found in a passion in respect of the passion's quantity, that is 
in respect of its excess or deficiency; and thus evil may be found in 
anger, when, to wit, one is angry, more or less than right reason 
demands. But if one is angry in accordance with right reason, one's anger 
is deserving of praise.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Stoics designated anger and all the other passions as 
emotions opposed to the order of reason; and accordingly they deemed 
anger and all other passions to be evil, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS024.html#FSQ24A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) when we were treating of the passions. It is in this sense that Jerome 
considers anger; for he speaks of the anger whereby one is angry with 
one's neighbor, with the intent of doing him a wrong.---But, according to 
the Peripatetics, to whose opinion Augustine inclines (De Civ. Dei ix, 
4), anger and the other passions of the soul are movements of the 
sensitive appetite, whether they be moderated or not, according to 
reason: and in this sense anger is not always evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Anger may stand in a twofold relation to reason. First, 
antecedently; in this way it withdraws reason from its rectitude, and has 
therefore the character of evil. Secondly, consequently, inasmuch as the 
movement of the sensitive appetite is directed against vice and in 
accordance with reason, this anger is  good, and is called "zealous 
anger." Wherefore Gregory says (Moral. v, 45): "We must beware lest, when 
we use anger as an instrument of virtue, it overrule the mind, and go 
before it as its mistress, instead of following in reason's train, ever 
ready, as its handmaid, to obey." This latter anger, although it hinder 
somewhat the judgment of reason in the execution of the act, does not 
destroy the rectitude of reason. Hence Gregory says (Moral. v, 45) that 
"zealous anger troubles the eye of reason, whereas sinful anger blinds 
it." Nor is it incompatible with virtue that the deliberation of reason 
be interrupted in the execution of what reason has deliberated: since art 
also would be hindered in its act, if it were to deliberate about what 
has to be done, while having to act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is unlawful to desire vengeance considered as evil to 
the man who is to be punished, but it is praiseworthy to desire vengeance 
as a corrective of vice and for the good of justice; and to this the 
sensitive appetite can tend, in so far as it is moved thereto by the 
reason: and when revenge is taken in accordance with the order of 
judgment, it is God's work, since he who has power to punish "is God's 
minister," as stated in Rm. 13:4.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> We can and ought to be like to God in the desire for good; 
but we cannot be altogether likened to Him in the mode of our desire, 
since in God there is no sensitive appetite, as in us, the movement of 
which has to obey reason. Wherefore Gregory says (Moral. v, 45) that 
"anger is more firmly erect in withstanding vice, when it bows to the 
command of reason."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that anger is not a sin. For we demerit by sinning. 
But "we do not demerit by the passions, even as neither do we incur blame 
thereby," as stated in Ethic. ii, 5. Consequently no passion is a sin. 
Now anger is a passion as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS046.html#FSQ46OUTP1">Question [46]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS046.html#FSQ46A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) in the treatise 
on the passions. Therefore anger is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in every sin there is conversion to some mutable good. 
But in anger there is conversion not to a mutable good, but to a person's 
evil. Therefore anger is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "No man sins in what he cannot avoid," as Augustine 
asserts [*De Lib. Arb. iii, 18]. But man cannot avoid anger, for a gloss 
on Ps. 4:5, "Be ye angry and sin not," says: "The movement of anger is 
not in our power." Again, the Philosopher asserts (Ethic. vii, 6) that 
"the angry man acts with displeasure." Now displeasure is contrary to the 
will. Therefore anger is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, sin is contrary to nature, according to Damascene [*De 
Fide Orth. ii, 4,30]. But it is not contrary to man's nature to be angry, 
and it is the natural act of a power,  namely the irascible; wherefore 
Jerome says in a letter [*Ep. xii ad Anton. Monach.] that "to be angry is 
the property of man." Therefore it is not a sin to be angry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++4:31">Eph. 4:31</a>): "Let all indignation and 
anger [*Vulg.: 'Anger and indignation'] . . . be put away from you."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Anger, as stated above (<A Href="SS158.html#SSQ158A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), is properly the name of a 
passion. A passion of the sensitive appetite is good in so far as it is 
regulated by reason, whereas it is evil if it set the order of reason 
aside. Now the order of reason, in regard to anger, may be considered in 
relation to two things. First, in relation to the appetible object to 
which anger tends, and that is revenge. Wherefore if one desire revenge 
to be taken in accordance with the order of reason, the desire of anger 
is praiseworthy, and is called "zealous anger" [*Cf. Greg., Moral. v, 
45]. On the other hand, if one desire the taking of vengeance in any way 
whatever contrary to the order of reason, for instance if he desire the 
punishment of one who has not deserved it, or beyond his deserts, or 
again contrary to the order prescribed by law, or not for the due end, 
namely the maintaining of justice and the correction of defaults, then 
the desire of anger will be sinful, and this is called sinful anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the order of reason in regard to anger may be considered in 
relation to the mode of being angry, namely that the movement of anger 
should not be immoderately fierce, neither internally nor externally; and 
if this condition be disregarded, anger will not lack sin, even though 
just vengeance be desired.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since passion may be either regulated or not regulated by 
reason, it follows that a passion considered absolutely does not include 
the notion of merit or demerit, of praise or blame. But as regulated by 
reason, it may be something meritorious and deserving of praise; while on 
the other hand, as not regulated by reason, it may be demeritorious and 
blameworthy. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 5) that "it is he 
who is angry in a certain way, that is praised or blamed."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The angry man desires the evil of another, not for its own 
sake but for the sake of revenge, towards which his appetite turns as to 
a mutable good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man is master of his actions through the judgment of his 
reason, wherefore as to the movements that forestall that judgment, it is 
not in man's power to prevent them as a whole, i.e. so that none of them 
arise, although his reason is able to check each one, if it arise. 
Accordingly it is stated that the movement of anger is not in man's 
power, to the extent namely that no such movement arise. Yet since this 
movement is somewhat in his power, it is not entirely sinless if it be 
inordinate. The statement of the Philosopher that "the angry man acts 
with displeasure," means that he is displeased, not with his being angry, 
but with the  injury which he deems done to himself: and through this 
displeasure he is moved to seek vengeance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The irascible power in man is naturally subject to his 
reason, wherefore its act is natural to man, in so far as it is in accord 
with reason, and in so far as it is against reason, it is contrary to 
man's nature.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether all anger is a mortal sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all anger is a mortal sin. For it is written 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+5:2">Job 5:2</a>): "Anger killeth the foolish man [*Vulg.: 'Anger indeed killeth 
the foolish']," and he speaks of the spiritual killing, whence mortal sin 
takes its name. Therefore all anger is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing save mortal sin is deserving of eternal 
condemnation. Now anger deserves eternal condemnation; for our Lord said 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++5:22">Mt. 5:22</a>): "Whosoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of 
the judgment": and a gloss on this passage says that "the three things 
mentioned there, namely judgment, council, and hell-fire, signify in a 
pointed manner different abodes in the state of eternal damnation 
corresponding to various sins." Therefore anger is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatsoever is contrary to charity is a mortal sin. Now 
anger is of itself contrary to charity, as Jerome declares in his 
commentary on Mt. 5:22, "Whosoever is angry with his brother," etc. where 
he says that this is contrary to the love of your neighbor. Therefore 
anger is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Ps. 4:5, "Be ye angry and sin not," says: 
"Anger is venial if it does not proceed to action."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The movement of anger may be inordinate and sinful in two 
ways, as stated above (<A Href="SS158.html#SSQ158A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). First, on the part of the appetible object, 
as when one desires unjust revenge; and thus anger is a mortal sin in the 
point of its genus, because it is contrary to charity and justice. 
Nevertheless such like anger may happen to be a venial sin by reason of 
the imperfection of the act. This imperfection is considered either in 
relation to the subject desirous of vengeance, as when the movement of 
anger forestalls the judgment of his reason; or in relation to the 
desired object, as when one desires to be avenged in a trifling matter, 
which should be deemed of no account, so that even if one proceeded to 
action, it would not be a mortal sin, for instance by pulling a child 
slightly by the hair, or by some other like action. Secondly, the 
movement of anger may be inordinate in the mode of being angry, for 
instance, if one be too fiercely angry inwardly, or if one exceed in the 
outward signs of anger. In this way anger is not a mortal sin in the 
point of its genus; yet it may happen to be a mortal sin, for instance if 
through the fierceness of his anger a man fall away from the love of God 
and his neighbor. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It does not follow from the passage quoted that all anger 
is a mortal sin, but that the foolish are killed spiritually by anger, 
because, through not checking the movement of anger by their reason, they 
fall into mortal sins, for instance by blaspheming God or by doing injury 
to their neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Our Lord said this of anger, by way of addition to the 
words of the Law: "Whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the 
judgment" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++5:21">Mt. 5:21</a>). Consequently our Lord is speaking here of the 
movement of anger wherein a man desires the killing or any grave injury 
of his neighbor: and should the consent of reason be given to this 
desire, without doubt it will be a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In the case where anger is contrary to charity, it is a 
mortal sin, but it is not always so, as appears from what we have said.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that anger is the most grievous sin. For Chrysostom 
says [*Hom. xlviii in Joan.] that "nothing is more repulsive than the 
look of an angry man, and nothing uglier than a ruthless* face, and most 
of all than a cruel soul." [*'Severo'. The correct text is 'Si vero.' The 
translation would then run thus . . . 'and nothing uglier.' And if his 
'face is ugly, how much uglier is his soul!']. Therefore anger is the 
most grievous sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the more hurtful a sin is, the worse it would seem to 
be; since, according to Augustine (Enchiridion xii), "a thing is said to 
be evil because it hurts." Now anger is most hurtful, because it deprives 
man of his reason, whereby he is master of himself; for Chrysostom says 
(Hom. xlviii in Joan.) that "anger differs in no way from madness; it is 
a demon while it lasts, indeed more troublesome than one harassed by a 
demon." Therefore anger is the most grievous sin.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, inward movements are judged according to their outward 
effects. Now the effect of anger is murder, which is a most grievous sin. 
Therefore anger is a most grievous sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Anger is compared to hatred as the mote to the beam; 
for Augustine says in his Rule (Ep. ccxi): "Lest anger grow into hatred 
and a mote become a beam." Therefore anger is not the most grievous sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS158.html#SSQ158ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), the inordinateness of anger is 
considered in a twofold respect, namely with regard to an undue object, 
and with regard to an undue mode of being angry. As to the appetible 
object which it desires, anger would seem to be the least of sins, for 
anger desires the evil of punishment for some person, under the aspect of 
a good that is vengeance. Hence on the part of the evil which it desires 
the sin of anger agrees with  those sins which desire the evil of our 
neighbor, such as envy and hatred; but while hatred desires absolutely 
another's evil as such, and the envious man desires another's evil 
through desire of his own glory, the angry man desires another's evil 
under the aspect of just revenge. Wherefore it is evident that hatred is 
more grievous than envy, and envy than anger: since it is worse to desire 
evil as an evil, than as a good; and to desire evil as an external good 
such as honor or glory, than under the aspect of the rectitude of 
justice. On the part of the good, under the aspect of which the angry man 
desires an evil, anger concurs with the sin of concupiscence that tends 
to a good. In this respect again, absolutely speaking. the sin of anger 
is apparently less grievous than that of concupiscence, according as the 
good of justice, which the angry man desires, is better than the 
pleasurable or useful good which is desired by the subject of 
concupiscence. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 4) that "the 
incontinent in desire is more disgraceful than the incontinent in anger."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, as to the inordinateness which regards the mode of 
being angry, anger would seem to have a certain pre-eminence on account 
of the strength and quickness of its movement, according to Prov. 27:4, 
"Anger hath no mercy, nor fury when it breaketh forth: and who can bear 
the violence of one provoked?" Hence Gregory says (Moral. v, 45): "The 
heart goaded by the pricks of anger is convulsed, the body trembles, the 
tongue entangles itself, the face is inflamed, the eyes are enraged and 
fail utterly to recognize those whom we know: the tongue makes sounds 
indeed, but there is no sense in its utterance."<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Chrysostom is alluding to the repulsiveness of the outward 
gestures which result from the impetuousness of anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument considers the inordinate movement of anger, 
that results from its impetuousness, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Murder results from hatred and envy no less than from 
anger: yet anger is less grievous, inasmuch as it considers the aspect of 
justice, as stated above.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the Philosopher suitably assigns the species of anger?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the species of anger are unsuitably assigned 
by the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 5) where he says that some angry persons 
are "choleric," some "sullen," and some "ill-tempered" or "stern." 
According to him, a person is said to be "sullen" whose anger "is 
appeased with difficulty and endures a long time." But this apparently 
pertains to the circumstance of time. Therefore it seems that anger can 
be differentiated specifically in respect also of the other circumstances.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he says (Ethic. iv, 5) that "ill-tempered" or "stern" 
persons "are those whose anger is not appeased without revenge, or 
punishment." Now this also pertains to the  unquenchableness of anger. 
Therefore seemingly the ill-tempered is the same as bitterness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, our Lord mentions three degrees of anger, when He says 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++5:22">Mt. 5:22</a>): "Whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of 
the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in 
danger of the council, and whosoever shall say" to his brother, "Thou 
fool." But these degrees are not referable to the aforesaid species. 
Therefore it seems that the above division of anger is not fitting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory of Nyssa [*Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxi] says 
"there are three species of irascibility," namely, "the anger which is 
called wrath [*'Fellea,' i.e. like gall. But in FS, Question [46], Article [8], St. 
Thomas quoting the same authority has {Cholos} which we render 'wrath']," 
and "ill-will" which is a disease of the mind, and "rancour." Now these 
three seem to coincide with the three aforesaid. For "wrath" he describes 
as "having beginning and movement," and the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 5) 
ascribes this to "choleric" persons: "ill-will" he describes as "an anger 
that endures and grows old," and this the Philosopher ascribes to 
"sullenness"; while he describes "rancour" as "reckoning the time for 
vengeance," which tallies with the Philosopher's description of the 
"ill-tempered." The same division is given by Damascene (De Fide Orth. 
ii, 16). Therefore the aforesaid division assigned by the Philosopher is 
not unfitting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The aforesaid distinction may be referred either to the 
passion, or to the sin itself of anger. We have already stated when 
treating of the passions (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS046.html#FSQ46OUTP1">Question [46]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS046.html#FSQ46A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>) how it is to be applied to the 
passion of anger. And it would seem that this is chiefly what Gregory of 
Nyssa and Damascene had in view. Here, however, we have to take the 
distinction of these species in its application to the sin of anger, and 
as set down by the Philosopher.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the inordinateness of anger may be considered in relation to two 
things. First, in relation to the origin of anger, and this regards 
"choleric" persons, who are angry too quickly and for any slight cause. 
Secondly, in relation to the duration of anger, for that anger endures 
too long; and this may happen in two ways. In one way, because the cause 
of anger, to wit, the inflicted injury, remains too long in a man's 
memory, the result being that it gives rise to a lasting displeasure, 
wherefore he is "grievous" and "sullen" to himself. In another way, it 
happens on the part of vengeance, which a man seeks with a stubborn 
desire: this applies to "ill-tempered" or "stern" people, who do not put 
aside their anger until they have inflicted punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is not time, but a man's propensity to anger, or his 
pertinacity in anger, that is the chief point of consideration in the 
aforesaid species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Both "sullen" and "ill-tempered" people have a  
long-lasting anger, but for different reasons. For a "sullen" person has 
an abiding anger on account of an abiding displeasure, which he holds 
locked in his breast; and as he does not break forth into the outward 
signs of anger, others cannot reason him out of it, nor does he of his 
own accord lay aside his anger, except his displeasure wear away with 
time and thus his anger cease. On the other hand, the anger of 
"ill-tempered" persons is long-lasting on account of their intense desire 
for revenge, so that it does not wear out with time, and can be quelled 
only by revenge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The degrees of anger mentioned by our Lord do not refer to 
the different species of anger, but correspond to the course of the human 
act [*Cf. FS, Question [46], Article [8], Objection [3]]. For the first degree is an inward 
conception, and in reference to this He says: "Whosoever is angry with 
his brother." The second degree is when the anger is manifested by 
outward signs, even before it breaks out into effect; and in reference to 
this He says: "Whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca!" which is an 
angry exclamation. The third degree is when the sin conceived inwardly 
breaks out into effect. Now the effect of anger is another's hurt under 
the aspect of revenge; and the least of hurts is that which is done by a 
mere word; wherefore in reference to this He says: "Whosoever shall say 
to his brother Thou fool!" Consequently it is clear that the second adds 
to the first, and the third to both the others; so that, if the first is 
a mortal sin, in the case referred to by our Lord, as stated above (<A Href="SS158.html#SSQ158A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2), much more so are the others. Wherefore some kind of condemnation 
is assigned as corresponding to each one of them. In the first case 
"judgment" is assigned, and this is the least severe, for as Augustine 
says [*Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 9], "where judgment is to be delivered, 
there is an opportunity for defense": in the second case "council" is 
assigned, "whereby the judges deliberate together on the punishment to be 
inflicted": to the third case is assigned "hell-fire," i.e. "decisive 
condemnation."<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that anger should not be reckoned among the capital 
sins. For anger is born of sorrow which is a capital vice known by the 
name of sloth. Therefore anger should not be reckoned a capital vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, hatred is a graver sin than anger. Therefore it should 
be reckoned a capital vice rather than anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a gloss on Prov. 29:22, "An angry [Douay: 'passionate'] 
man provoketh quarrels," says: "Anger is the door to all vices: if it be 
closed, peace is ensured within to all the virtues; if it be opened, the 
soul is armed for every crime." Now no capital vice is the origin of all 
sins, but only of certain definite ones. Therefore anger should not be 
reckoned among the capital vices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45) places anger among the 
capital vices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>,4), a capital vice is 
defined as one from which many vices arise. Now there are two reasons for 
which many vices can arise from anger. The first is on the part of its 
object which has much of the aspect of desirability, in so far as revenge 
is desired under the aspect of just or honest*, which is attractive by 
its excellence, as stated above (<A Href="SS158.html#SSQ158A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). [*Honesty must be taken here in 
its broad sense as synonymous with moral goodness, from the point of view 
of decorum; Cf. Question [145], Article [1]]. The second is on the part of its 
impetuosity, whereby it precipitates the mind into all kinds of 
inordinate action. Therefore it is evident that anger is a capital vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The sorrow whence anger arises is not, for the most part, 
the vice of sloth, but the passion of sorrow, which results from an 
injury inflicted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS118.html#SSQ118OUTP1">Question [118]</a>, <A Href="SS118.html#SSQ118A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>; <A Href="SS148.html#SSQ148OUTP1">Question [148]</a>, <A Href="SS148.html#SSQ148A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="SS153.html#SSQ153OUTP1">Question [153]</a>, <A Href="SS153.html#SSQ153A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), it belongs to the notion of a capital vice to have a 
most desirable end, so that many sins are committed through the desire 
thereof. Now anger, which desires evil under the aspect of good, has a 
more desirable end than hatred has, since the latter desires evil under 
the aspect of evil: wherefore anger is more a capital vice than hatred is.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Anger is stated to be the door to the vices accidentally, 
that is by removing obstacles, to wit by hindering the judgment of 
reason, whereby man is withdrawn from evil. It is, however, directly the 
cause of certain special sins, which are called its daughters.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that six daughters are unfittingly assigned to 
anger, namely "quarreling, swelling of the mind, contumely, clamor, 
indignation and blasphemy." For blasphemy is reckoned by Isidore [*Questions. in 
Deut., qu. xvi] to be a daughter of pride. Therefore it should not be 
accounted a daughter of anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, hatred is born of anger, as Augustine says in his rule 
(Ep. ccxi). Therefore it should be placed among the daughters of anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "a swollen mind" would seem to be the same as pride. Now 
pride is not the daughter of a vice, but "the mother of all vices," as 
Gregory states (Moral. xxxi, 45). Therefore swelling of the mind should 
not be reckoned among the daughters of anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45) assigns these daughters to 
anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[7] Body Para. 1/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Anger may be considered in three ways. First, as 
consisting in thought, and thus two vices arise from anger. one is on the 
part of the person with whom a man is angry, and whom he deems unworthy 
[indignum] of acting thus towards him, and this is called "indignation." 
The other vice is on the part of the man himself, in so far as he devises 
various means of vengeance, and with such like thoughts fills his mind, 
according to Job 15:2, "Will a wise man . . . fill his stomach with 
burning heat?" And thus we have "swelling of the mind."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[7] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, anger may be considered, as expressed in words: and thus a 
twofold disorder arises from anger. One is when a man manifests his anger 
in his manner of speech, as stated above (<A Href="SS158.html#SSQ158A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 3) of the man who says 
to his brother, "Raca": and this refers to "clamor," which denotes 
disorderly and confused speech. The other disorder is when a man breaks 
out into injurious words, and if these be against God, it is "blasphemy," 
if against one's neighbor, it is "contumely."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[7] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, anger may be considered as proceeding to deeds; and thus anger 
gives rise to "quarrels," by which we are to understand all manner of 
injuries inflicted on one's neighbor through anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The blasphemy into which a man breaks out deliberately 
proceeds from pride, whereby a man lifts himself up against God: since, 
according to Ecclus. 10:14, "the beginning of the pride of man is to fall 
off from God," i.e. to fall away from reverence for Him is the first part 
of pride [*Cf. Question [162], Article [7], ad 2]; and this gives rise to blasphemy. But 
the blasphemy into which a man breaks out through a disturbance of the 
mind, proceeds from anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although hatred sometimes arises from anger, it has a 
previous cause, from which it arises more directly, namely displeasure, 
even as, on the other hand, love is born of pleasure. Now through 
displeasure, a man is moved sometimes to anger, sometimes to hatred. 
Wherefore it was fitting to reckon that hatred arises from sloth rather 
than from anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Swelling of the mind is not taken here as identical with 
pride, but for a certain effort or daring attempt to take vengeance; and 
daring is a vice opposed to fortitude.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there. is not a vice opposed to anger, 
resulting from lack of anger. For no vice makes us like to God. Now by 
being entirely without anger, a man becomes like to God, Who judges "with 
tranquillity" (Wis. 12:18). Therefore seemingly it is not a vice to be 
altogether without anger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is not a vice to lack what is altogether  useless. 
But the movement of anger is useful for no purpose, as Seneca proves in 
the book he wrote on anger (De Ira i, 9, seqq.). Therefore it seems that 
lack of anger is not a vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv), "man's evil is to 
be without reason." Now the judgment of reason remains unimpaired, if all 
movement of anger be done away. Therefore no lack of anger amounts to a 
vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Chrysostom [*Hom. xi in Matth. in the Opus Imperfectum, 
falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom] says: "He who is not angry, 
whereas he has cause to be, sins. For unreasonable patience is the hotbed 
of many vices, it fosters negligence, and incites not only the wicked but 
even the good to do wrong."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Anger may be understood in two ways. In one way, as a 
simple movement of the will, whereby one inflicts punishment, not through 
passion, but in virtue of a judgment of the reason: and thus without 
doubt lack of anger is a sin. This is the sense in which anger is taken 
in the saying of Chrysostom, for he says (Hom. xi in Matth., in the Opus 
Imperfectum, falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom): "Anger, when it 
has a cause, is not anger but judgment. For anger, properly speaking, 
denotes a movement of passion": and when a man is angry with reason, his 
anger is no longer from passion: wherefore he is said to judge, not to be 
angry. In another way anger is taken for a movement of the sensitive 
appetite, which is with passion resulting from a bodily transmutation. 
This movement is a necessary sequel, in man, to the movement of his will, 
since the lower appetite necessarily follows the movement of the higher 
appetite, unless there be an obstacle. Hence the movement of anger in the 
sensitive appetite cannot be lacking altogether, unless the movement of 
the will be altogether lacking or weak. Consequently lack of the passion 
of anger is also a vice, even as the lack of movement in the will 
directed to punishment by the judgment of reason.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> He that is entirely without anger when he ought to be 
angry, imitates God as to lack of passion, but not as to God's punishing 
by judgment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The passion of anger, like all other movements of the 
sensitive appetite, is useful, as being conducive to the more prompt 
execution [*Cf. FS, Question [24], Article [3]] of reason's dictate: else, the sensitive 
appetite in man would be to no purpose, whereas "nature does nothing 
without purpose" [*Aristotle, De Coelo i, 4].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[158] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When a man acts inordinately, the judgment of his reason is 
cause not only of the simple movement of the will but also of the passion 
in the sensitive appetite, as stated above. Wherefore just as the removal 
of the effect is a sign that the cause is removed, so the lack of anger 
is a sign that the judgment of reason is lacking.<br>
