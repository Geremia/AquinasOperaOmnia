<br>
OF SHAMEFACEDNESS (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the parts of temperance in particular: and in the 
first place the integral parts, which are shamefacedness and honesty. 
With regard to shamefacedness there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS144.html#SSQ144A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether shamefacedness is a virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS144.html#SSQ144A2THEP1">(2)</a> What is its object?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS144.html#SSQ144A3THEP1">(3)</a> Who are the cause of a man being ashamed?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS144.html#SSQ144A4THEP1">(4)</a> What kind of people are ashamed?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that shamefacedness is a virtue. For it is proper to a 
virtue "to observe the mean as fixed by reason": this is clear from the 
definition of virtue given in Ethic. ii, 6. Now shamefacedness observes 
the mean in this way, as the Philosopher observes (Ethic. ii, 7). 
Therefore shamefacedness is a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is praiseworthy is either a virtue or something 
connected with virtue. Now shamefacedness is praiseworthy. But it is not 
part of a virtue. For it is not a part of prudence, since it is not in 
the reason but in the appetite; nor is it a part of justice. since 
shamefacedness implies a certain passion, whereas justice is not about 
the passions; nor again is it a part of fortitude, because it belongs to 
fortitude to be persistent and aggressive, while it belongs to 
shamefacedness to recoil from something; nor lastly is it a part of 
temperance, since the latter is about desires, whereas shamefacedness is 
a kind of fear according as the Philosopher states (Ethic. iv, 9) and 
Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 15). Hence it follows that shamefacedness is 
a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the honest and the virtuous are convertible according to 
Tully (De Offic. i, 27). Now shamefacedness is a part of honesty: for 
Ambrose says (De Offic. i, 43) that "shamefacedness is the companion and 
familiar of the restful mind, averse to wantonness, a stranger to any 
kind of excess, the friend of sobriety and the support of what is honest, 
a seeker after the beautiful." Therefore shamefacedness is a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, every vice is opposed to a virtue. Now certain vices are 
opposed to shamefacedness, namely shamelessness and inordinate prudery. 
Therefore shamefacedness is a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, "like acts beget like habits," according to Ethic. ii, 
1. Now shamefacedness implies a praiseworthy act; wherefore from many 
such acts a habit results. But a habit of praiseworthy deeds is a virtue, 
according to the Philosopher (Ethic. i, 12). Therefore shamefacedness is 
a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 9) that 
shamefacedness is not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Virtue is taken in two ways, in a strict sense and in a 
broad sense. Taken strictly virtue is a perfection, as stated in Phys. 
vii, 17,18. Wherefore anything that is inconsistent with perfection, 
though it be good, falls short of the notion of virtue. Now 
shamefacedness is inconsistent with perfection, because it is the fear of 
something base, namely of that which is disgraceful. Hence Damascene says 
(De Fide Orth. ii, 15) that "shamefacedness is fear of a base action." 
Now just as hope is about a possible and difficult good, so is fear about 
a possible and arduous evil, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS041.html#FSQ41OUTP1">Question [41]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS041.html#FSQ41A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS042.html#FSQ42OUTP1">Question [42]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS042.html#FSQ42A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), when we were treating of the passions. But one 
who is  perfect as to a virtuous habit, does not apprehend that which 
would be disgraceful and base to do, as being possible and arduous, that 
is to say difficult for him to avoid; nor does he actually do anything 
base, so as to be in fear of disgrace. Therefore shamefacedness, properly 
speaking, is not a virtue, since it falls short of the perfection of 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Taken, however, in a broad sense virtue denotes whatever is good and 
praiseworthy in human acts or passions; and in this way /shamefacedness 
is sometimes called a virtue, since it is a praiseworthy passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Observing the mean is not sufficient for the notion of 
virtue, although it is one of the conditions included in virtue's 
definition: but it is requisite, in addition to this, that it be "an 
elective habit," that is to say, operating from choice. Now 
shamefacedness denotes, not a habit but a passion, nor does its movement 
result from choice, but from an impulse of passion. Hence it falls short 
of the notion of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above, shamefacedness is fear of baseness and 
disgrace. Now it has been stated (<A Href="SS142.html#SSQ142OUTP1">Question [142]</a>, <A Href="SS142.html#SSQ142A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) that the vice of 
intemperance is most base and disgraceful. Wherefore shamefacedness 
pertains more to temperance than to any other virtue, by reason of its 
motive cause, which is a base action though not according to the species 
of the passion, namely fear. Nevertheless in so far as the vices opposed 
to other virtues are base and disgraceful, shamefacedness may also 
pertain to other virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Shamefacedness fosters honesty, by removing that which is 
contrary thereto, but not so as to attain to the perfection of honesty.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Every defect causes a vice, but not every good is 
sufficient for the notion of virtue. Consequently it does not follow that 
whatever is directly opposed to vice is a virtue, although every vice is 
opposed to a virtue, as regards its origin. Hence shamelessness, in so 
far as it results from excessive love of disgraceful things, is opposed 
to temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Being frequently ashamed causes the habit of an acquired 
virtue whereby one avoids disgraceful things which are the object of 
shamefacedness, without continuing to be ashamed in their regard: 
although as a consequence of this acquired virtue, a man would be more 
ashamed, if confronted with the matter of shamefacedness.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether shamefacedness is about a disgraceful action?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that shamefacedness is not about a disgraceful 
action. For the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 9) that "shamefacedness is 
fear of disgrace." Now sometimes those who do  nothing wrong suffer 
ignominy, according to Ps. 67:8, "For thy sake I have borne reproach, 
shame hath covered my face." Therefore shamefacedness is not properly 
about a disgraceful action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing apparently is disgraceful but what is sinful. 
Yet man is ashamed of things that are not sins, for instance when he 
performs a menial occupation. Therefore it seems that shamefacedness is 
not properly about a disgraceful action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, virtuous deeds are not disgraceful but most beautiful 
according to Ethic. i, 8. Yet sometimes people are ashamed to do virtuous 
deeds, according to Lk. 9:26, "He that shall be ashamed of Me and My 
words, of him the Son of man shall be ashamed," etc. Therefore 
shamefacedness is not about a disgraceful action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if shamefacedness were properly about a disgraceful 
action, it would follow that the more disgraceful the action the more 
ashamed would one be. Yet sometimes a man is more ashamed of lesser sins, 
while he glories in those which are most grievous, according to Ps. 51:3, 
"Why dost thou glory in malice?" Therefore shamefacedness is not properly 
about a disgraceful action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 15) and Gregory of Nyssa 
[*Nemesius, (De Nat. Hom. xx)] say that "shamefacedness is fear of doing 
a disgraceful deed or of a disgraceful deed done."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS041.html#FSQ41OUTP1">Question [41]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS041.html#FSQ41A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS042.html#FSQ42OUTP1">Question [42]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS042.html#FSQ42A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), when 
we were treating of the passions, fear is properly about an arduous evil, 
one, namely, that is difficult to avoid. Now disgrace is twofold. There 
is the disgrace inherent to vice, which consists in the deformity of a 
voluntary act: and this, properly speaking, has not the character of an 
arduous evil. For that which depends on the will alone does not appear to 
be arduous and above man's ability: wherefore it is not apprehended as 
fearful, and for this reason the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 5) that such 
evils are not a matter of fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other kind of disgrace is penal so to speak, and it consists in the 
reproach that attaches to a person, just as the clarity of glory consists 
in a person being honored. And since this reproach has the character of 
an arduous evil, just as honor has the character of an arduous good, 
shamefacedness, which is fear of disgrace, regards first and foremost 
reproach or ignominy. And since reproach is properly due to vice, as 
honor is due to virtue, it follows that shamefacedness regards also the 
disgrace inherent to vice. Hence the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 5) that 
"a man is less ashamed of those defects which are not the result of any 
fault of his own."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now shamefacedness regards fault in two ways. In one way a man refrains 
from vicious acts through fear of reproach: in another way a man while 
doing a disgraceful deed avoids the public eye through  fear of reproach. 
In the former case, according to Gregory of Nyssa (Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. 
xx), we speak of a person "blushing," in the latter we say that he is 
"ashamed." Hence he says that "the man who is ashamed acts in secret, but 
he who blushes fears to be disgraced."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Shamefacedness properly regards disgrace as due to sin 
which is a voluntary defect. Hence the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 6) 
that "a man is more ashamed of those things of which he is the cause." 
Now the virtuous man despises the disgrace to which he is subject on 
account of virtue, because he does not deserve it; as the Philosopher 
says of the magnanimous (Ethic. iv, 3). Thus we find it said of the 
apostles (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+5%3A41">Acts 5:41</a>) that "they (the apostles) went from the presence of 
the council, rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach 
for the name of Jesus." It is owing to imperfection of virtue that a man 
is sometimes ashamed of the reproaches which he suffers on account of 
virtue, since the more virtuous a man is, the more he despises external 
things, whether good or evil. Wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++51%3A7">Is. 51:7</a>): "Fear 
ye not the reproach of men."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS063.html#SSQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>, <A Href="SS063.html#SSQ63A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), though honor is not really 
due save to virtue alone, yet it regards a certain excellence: and the 
same applies to reproach, for though it is properly due to sin alone, 
yet, at least in man's opinion, it regards any kind of defect. Hence a 
man is ashamed of poverty, disrepute, servitude, and the like.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Shamefacedness does not regard virtuous deeds as such. Yet 
it happens accidentally that a man is ashamed of them either because he 
looks upon them as vicious according to human opinion, or because he is 
afraid of being marked as presumptuous or hypocritical for doing virtuous 
deeds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Sometimes more grievous sins are less shameful, either 
because they are less disgraceful, as spiritual sins in comparison with 
sins of the flesh, or because they connote a certain abundance of some 
temporal good; thus a man is more ashamed of cowardice than of daring, of 
theft than of robbery, on account of a semblance of power. The same 
applies to other sins.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether man is more shamefaced of those who are more closely connected with him?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man is not more shamefaced of those who are 
more closely connected with him. For it is stated in Rhet. ii, 6 that 
"men are more shamefaced of those from whom they desire approbation." Now 
men desire this especially from people of the better sort who are 
sometimes not connected with them. Therefore man is not more shamefaced 
of those who are more closely connected with him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, seemingly those are more closely connected who  perform 
like deeds. Now man is not made ashamed of his sin by those whom he knows 
to be guilty of the same sin, because according to Rhet. ii, 6, "a man 
does not forbid his neighbor what he does himself." Therefore he is not 
more shamefaced of those who are most closely connected with him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 6) that "men take more 
shame from those who retail their information to many, such as jokers and 
fable-tellers." But those who are more closely connected with a man do 
not retail his vices. Therefore one should not take shame chiefly from 
them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 6) that "men are most 
liable to be made ashamed by those among whom they have done nothing 
amiss; by those of whom they ask something for the first time; by those 
whose friends they wish to become." Now these are less closely connected 
with us. Therefore man is not made most ashamed by those who are more 
closely united to him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is stated in Rhet. ii, 6 that "man is made most 
ashamed by those who are to be continually with him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since reproach is opposed to honor, just as honor denotes 
attestation to someone's excellence, especially the excellence which is 
according to virtue, so too reproach, the fear of which is 
shamefacedness, denotes attestation to a person's defect, especially that 
which results from sin. Hence the more weighty a person's attestation is 
considered to be, the more does he make another person ashamed. Now a 
person's attestation may be considered as being more weighty, either 
because he is certain of the truth or because of its effect. Certitude of 
the truth attaches to a person's attestations for two reasons. First on 
account of the rectitude of his judgement, as in the case of wise and 
virtuous men, by whom man is more desirous of being honored and by whom 
he is brought to a greater sense of shame. Hence children and the lower 
animals inspire no one with shame, by reason of their lack of judgment. 
Secondly, on account of his knowledge of the matter attested, because 
"everyone judges well of what is known to him" [*Ethic. i, 3]. In this 
way we are more liable to be made ashamed by persons connected with us, 
since they are better acquainted with our deeds: whereas strangers and 
persons entirely unknown to us, who are ignorant of what we do, inspire 
us with no shame at all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; An attestation receives weight from its effect by reason of some 
advantage or harm resulting therefrom; wherefore men are more desirous of 
being honored by those who can be of use to them, and are more liable to 
be made ashamed by those who are able to do them some harm. And for this 
reason again, in a certain respect, persons connected with us make us 
more ashamed, since we are to be continually in their society, as though 
this entailed a continual harm to us: whereas the harm that comes from 
strangers and passersby ceases almost at once.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> People of the better sort make us ashamed for the  same 
reason as those who are more closely connected with us; because just as 
the attestation of the better men carries more weight since they have a 
more universal knowledge of things, and in their judgments hold fast to 
the truth: so, too, the attestation of those among whom we live is more 
cogent since they know more about our concerns in detail.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> We fear not the attestation of those who are connected with 
us in the likeness of sin, because we do not think that they look upon 
our defect as disgraceful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Tale-bearers make us ashamed on account of the harm they do 
by making many think ill of us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Even those among whom we have done no wrong, make us more 
ashamed, on account of the harm that would follow, because, to wit, we 
should forfeit the good opinion they had of us: and again because when 
contraries are put in juxtaposition their opposition seems greater, so 
that when a man notices something disgraceful in one whom he esteemed 
good, he apprehends it as being the more disgraceful. The reason why we 
are made more ashamed by those of whom we ask something for the first 
time, or whose friends we wish to be, is that we fear to suffer some 
injury, by being disappointed in our request, or by failing to become 
their friends.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether even virtuous men can be ashamed?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that even virtuous men can be ashamed. For 
contraries have contrary effects. Now those who excel in wickedness are 
not ashamed, according to Jer. 3:3, "Thou hadst a harlot's forehead, thou 
wouldst not blush." Therefore those who are virtuous are more inclined to 
be ashamed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 6) that "men are ashamed 
not only of vice, but also of the signs of evil": and this happens also 
in the virtuous. Therefore virtuous men can be ashamed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, shamefacedness is "fear of disgrace" [*Ethic. iv, 9]. 
Now virtuous people may happen to be ignominious, for instance if they 
are slandered, or if they suffer reproach undeservedly. Therefore a 
virtuous man can be ashamed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, shamefacedness is a part of temperance, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS143.html#SSQ143OUTP1">Question [143]</a>). Now a part is not separated from its whole. Since then 
temperance is in a virtuous man, it means that shamefacedness is also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 9) that a "virtuous 
man is not shamefaced."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS144.html#SSQ144ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2) shamefacedness is fear of some 
disgrace. Now it may happen in two ways that an evil is not  feared: 
first, because it is not reckoned an evil; secondly because one reckons 
it impossible with regard to oneself, or as not difficult to avoid.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly shame may be lacking in a person in two ways. First, because 
the things that should make him ashamed are not deemed by him to be 
disgraceful; and in this way those who are steeped in sin are without 
shame, for instead of disapproving of their sins, they boast of them. 
Secondly, because they apprehend disgrace as impossible to themselves, or 
as easy to avoid. In this way the old and the virtuous are not 
shamefaced. Yet they are so disposed, that if there were anything 
disgraceful in them they would be ashamed of it. Wherefore the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 9) that "shame is in the virtuous 
hypothetically."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Lack of shame occurs in the best and in the worst men 
through different causes, as stated in the Article. In the average men it 
is found, in so far as they have a certain love of good, and yet are not 
altogether free from evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It belongs to the virtuous man to avoid not only vice, but 
also whatever has the semblance of vice, according to 1 Thess. 5:22, 
"From all appearance of evil refrain yourselves." The Philosopher, too, 
says (Ethic. iv, 9) that the virtuous man should avoid "not only what is 
really evil, but also those things that are regarded as evil."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS144.html#SSQ144A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1) the virtuous man despises 
ignominy and reproach, as being things he does not deserve, wherefore he 
is not much ashamed of them. Nevertheless, to a certain extent, shame, 
like the other passions, may forestall reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[144] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Shamefacedness is a part of temperance, not as though it 
entered into its essence, but as a disposition to it: wherefore Ambrose 
says (De Offic. i, 43) that "shamefacedness lays the first foundation of 
temperance," by inspiring man with the horror of whatever is disgraceful.<br>
