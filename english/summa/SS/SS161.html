  <h3 align="center">OF HUMILITY (SIX ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must consider next the species of modesty: (1) Humility, and pride which
    is opposed to it; (2) Studiousness, and its opposite, Curiosity; (3) Modesty
    as affecting words or deeds; (4) Modesty as affecting outward attire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Concerning humility there are six points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS161.html#SSQ161A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether humility is a virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS161.html#SSQ161A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it resides in the
    appetite, or in the judgment of reason?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS161.html#SSQ161A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether by humility one ought to
    subject oneself to all men?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS161.html#SSQ161A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is a part of modesty
    or temperance?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS161.html#SSQ161A5THEP1">(5)</a> Of its comparison with the other
    virtues;
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS161.html#SSQ161A6THEP1">(6)</a> Of the degrees of humility.</p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether humility is a virtue?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that humility is not a virtue. For
    virtue conveys the notion of a penal evil, according to Ps. 104:18, "They
    humbled his feet in fetters." Therefore humility is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, virtue and vice are mutually opposed.
    Now humility seemingly denotes a vice, for it is written (Ecclus. 19:23):
    "There is one that humbleth himself wickedly." Therefore humility is not a
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no virtue is opposed to another virtue.
    But humility is apparently opposed to the virtue of magnanimity, which aims
    at great things, whereas humility shuns them. Therefore it would seem that
    humility is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, virtue is "the disposition of that which
    is perfect" (Phys. vii, text. 17). But humility seemingly belongs to the
    imperfect: wherefore it becomes not God to be humble, since He can be
    subject to none. Therefore it seems that humility is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, every moral virtue is about actions and
    passions, according to Ethic. ii, 3. But humility is not reckoned by the
    Philosopher among the virtues that are about passions, nor is it comprised
    under justice which is about actions. Therefore it would seem not to be a
    virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Origen commenting on Lk. 1:48, "He hath
    regarded the humility of His handmaid," says (Hom. viii in Luc.): "One of
    the virtues, humility, is particularly commended in Holy Writ; for our
    Saviour said: 'Learn of Me, because I am meek, and humble of heart.'"<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) when we were
    treating of the passions, the difficult good has something attractive to the
    appetite, namely the aspect of good, and likewise something repulsive to the
    appetite, namely the difficulty of obtaining it. In respect of the former
    there arises the movement of hope, and in respect of the latter, the
    movement of despair. Now it has been stated above (<a href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) that for those
    appetitive movements which are a kind of impulse towards an object, there is
    need of a moderating and restraining moral virtue, while for those which are
    a kind of recoil, there is need, on the part of the appetite, of a moral
    virtue to strengthen it and urge it on. Wherefore a twofold virtue is
    necessary with regard to the difficult good: one, to temper and restrain the
    mind, lest it tend to high things immoderately; and this belongs to the
    virtue of humility: and another to strengthen the mind against despair, and
    urge it on to the pursuit of great things according to right reason; and
    this is magnanimity. Therefore it is evident that humility is a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Isidore observes (Etym. x), "a humble
    man is so called because he is, as it were, 'humo acclinis'" [*Literally,
    'bent to the ground'], i.e. inclined to the lowest place. This may happen in
    two ways. First, through an extrinsic principle, for instance when one is
    cast down by another, and thus humility is a punishment. Secondly, through
    an intrinsic principle: and this may be done sometimes well, for instance
    when a man, considering his own failings, assumes the lowest place according
    to his mode: thus Abraham said to the Lord (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++18%3A27"
      >Gn. 18:27</a
    >), "I will speak to my Lord, whereas I am dust and ashes." In this way
    humility is a virtue. Sometimes, however, this may be ill-done, for instance
    when man, "not understanding his honor, compares himself to senseless
    beasts, and becomes like to them" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++48%3A13"
      >Ps. 48:13</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated (ad 1), humility, in so far as
    it is a virtue, conveys the notion of a praiseworthy self-abasement to the
    lowest place. Now this is sometimes done merely as to outward signs and
    pretense: wherefore this is "false humility," of which Augustine says in a
    letter (Ep. cxlix) that it is "grievous pride," since to wit, it would seem
    to aim at excellence of glory. Sometimes, however, this is done by an inward
    movement of the soul, and in this way, properly speaking, humility is
    reckoned a virtue, because virtue does not consist externals, but chiefly in
    the inward choice of the mind, as the Philosopher states (Ethic. ii, 5).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Humility restrains the appetite from
    aiming at great things against right reason: while magnanimity urges the
    mind to great things in accord with right reason. Hence it is clear that
    magnanimity is not opposed to humility: indeed they concur in this, that
    each is according to right reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A thing is said to be perfect in two
    ways. First absolutely; such a thing contains no defect, neither in its
    nature nor in respect of anything else, and thus God alone is perfect. To
    Him humility is fitting, not as regards His Divine nature, but only as
    regards His assumed nature. Secondly, a thing may be said to be perfect in a
    restricted sense, for instance in respect of its nature or state or time.
    Thus a virtuous man is perfect: although in comparison with God his
    perfection is found wanting, according to the word of Is. 40:17, "All
    nations are before Him as if they had no being at all." In this way humility
    may be competent to every man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The Philosopher intended to treat of
    virtues as directed to civic life, wherein the subjection of one man to
    another is defined according to the ordinance of the law, and consequently
    is a matter of legal justice. But humility, considered as a special virtue,
    regards chiefly the subjection of man to God, for Whose sake he humbles
    himself by subjecting himself to others.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether humility has to do with the appetite?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that humility concerns, not the
    appetite but the judgment of reason. Because humility is opposed to pride.
    Now pride concerns things pertaining to knowledge: for Gregory says (Moral.
    xxxiv, 22) that "pride, when it extends outwardly to the body, is first of
    all shown in the eyes": wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++130%3A1"
      >Ps. 130:1</a
    >), "Lord, my heart is not exalted, nor are my eyes lofty." Now eyes are the
    chief aids to knowledge. Therefore it would seem that humility is chiefly
    concerned with knowledge, whereby one thinks little of oneself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Virginit. xxxi) that
    "almost the whole of Christian teaching is humility." Consequently nothing
    contained in Christian teaching is incompatible with humility. Now Christian
    teaching admonishes us to seek the better things, according to 1 Cor. 12:31,
    "Be zealous for the better gifts." Therefore it belongs to humility to
    restrain not the desire of difficult things but the estimate thereof.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it belongs to the same virtue both to
    restrain excessive movement, and to strengthen the soul against excessive
    withdrawal: thus fortitude both curbs daring and fortifies the soul against
    fear. Now it is magnanimity that strengthens the soul against the
    difficulties that occur in the pursuit of great things. Therefore if
    humility were to curb the desire of great things, it would follow that
    humility is not a distinct virtue from magnanimity, which is evidently
    false. Therefore humility is concerned, not with the desire but with the
    estimate of great things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Andronicus [*De Affectibus] assigns
    humility to outward show; for he says that humility is "the habit of
    avoiding excessive expenditure and parade." Therefore it is not concerned
    with the movement of the appetite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Poenit. [*Serm. cccli])
    that "the humble man is one who chooses to be an abject in the house of the
    Lord, rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners." But choice concerns the
    appetite. Therefore humility has to do with the appetite rather than with
    the estimative power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS161.html#SSQ161A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), it belongs properly to humility, that a man restrain himself from being
    borne towards that which is above him. For this purpose he must know his
    disproportion to that which surpasses his capacity. Hence knowledge of one's
    own deficiency belongs to humility, as a rule guiding the appetite.
    Nevertheless humility is essentially in the appetite itself; and
    consequently it must be said that humility, properly speaking, moderates the
    movement of the appetite.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Lofty eyes are a sign of pride, inasmuch
    as it excludes respect and fear: for fearing and respectful persons are
    especially wont to lower the eyes, as though not daring to compare
    themselves with others. But it does not follow from this that humility is
    essentially concerned with knowledge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is contrary to humility to aim at
    greater things through confiding in one's own powers: but to aim at greater
    things through confidence in God's help, is not contrary to humility;
    especially since the more one subjects oneself to God, the more is one
    exalted in God's sight. Hence Augustine says (De Virginit. xxxi): "It is one
    thing to raise oneself to God, and another to raise oneself up against God.
    He that abases himself before Him, him He raiseth up; he that raises himself
    up against Him, him He casteth down."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In fortitude there is the same reason
    for restraining daring and for strengthening the soul against fear: since
    the reason in both cases is that man should set the good of reason before
    dangers of death. But the reason for restraining presumptuous hope which
    pertains to humility is not the same as the reason for strengthening the
    soul against despair. Because the reason for strengthening the soul against
    despair is the acquisition of one's proper good lest man, by despair, render
    himself unworthy of a good which was competent to him; while the chief
    reason for suppressing presumptuous hope is based on divine reverence, which
    shows that man ought not to ascribe to himself more than is competent to him
    according to the position in which God has placed him. Wherefore humility
    would seem to denote in the first place man's subjection to God; and for
    this reason Augustine (De Serm. Dom. in Monte i, 4) ascribes humility, which
    he understands by poverty of spirit, to the gift of fear whereby man reveres
    God. Hence it follows that the relation of fortitude to daring differs from
    that of humility to hope. Because fortitude uses daring more than it
    suppresses it: so that excess of daring is more like fortitude than lack of
    daring is. On the other hand, humility suppresses hope or confidence in self
    more than it uses it; wherefore excessive self-confidence is more opposed to
    humility than lack of confidence is.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Excess in outward expenditure and parade
    is wont to be done with a view of boasting, which is suppressed by humility.
    Accordingly humility has to do, in a secondary way, with externals, as signs
    of the inward movement of the appetite.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether one ought, by humility, to subject oneself to all men?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one ought not, by humility, to
    subject oneself to all men. For, as stated above (<a
      href="SS161.html#SSQ161A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, ad 3), humility consists chiefly in man's subjection to God. Now one
    ought not to offer to a man that which is due to God, as is the case with
    all acts of religious worship. Therefore, by humility, one ought not to
    subject oneself to man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Nat. et Gratia
    xxxiv): "Humility should take the part of truth, not of falsehood." Now some
    men are of the highest rank, who cannot, without falsehood, subject
    themselves to their inferiors. Therefore one ought not, by humility, to
    subject oneself to all men.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further no one ought to do that which conduces to
    the detriment of another's spiritual welfare. But if a man subject himself
    to another by humility, this is detrimental to the person to whom he
    subjects himself; for the latter might wax proud, or despise the other.
    Hence Augustine says in his Rule (Ep. ccxi): "Lest through excessive
    humility the superior lose his authority." Therefore a man ought not, by
    humility, to subject himself to all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Phil++2%3A3"
      >Phil. 2:3</a
    >): "In humility, let each esteem others better than themselves."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We may consider two things in man, namely that
    which is God's, and that which is man's. Whatever pertains to defect is
    man's: but whatever pertains to man's welfare and perfection is God's,
    according to the saying of Osee 13:9, "Destruction is thy own, O Israel; thy
    help is only in Me." Now humility, as stated above (<a
      href="SS161.html#SSQ161A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 5; <a href="SS161.html#SSQ161A1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3),
    properly regards the reverence whereby man is subject to God. Wherefore
    every man, in respect of that which is his own, ought to subject himself to
    every neighbor, in respect of that which the latter has of God's: but
    humility does not require a man to subject what he has of God's to that
    which may seem to be God's in another. For those who have a share of God's
    gifts know that they have them, according to 1 Cor. 2:12: "That we may know
    the things that are given us from God." Wherefore without prejudice to
    humility they may set the gifts they have received from God above those that
    others appear to have received from Him; thus the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++3%3A5"
      >Eph. 3:5</a
    >): "(The mystery of Christ) was not known to the sons of men as it is now
    revealed to His holy apostles." In like manner. humility does not require a
    man to subject that which he has of his own to that which his neighbor has
    of man's: otherwise each one would have to esteem himself a greater sinner
    than anyone else: whereas the Apostle says without prejudice to humility (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++2%3A15"
      >Gal. 2:15</a
    >): "We by nature are Jews, and not of the Gentiles, sinners." Nevertheless
    a man may esteem his neighbor to have some good which he lacks himself, or
    himself to have some evil which another has not: by reason of which, he may
    subject himself to him with humility.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We must not only revere God in Himself,
    but also that which is His in each one, although not with the same measure
    of reverence as we revere God. Wherefore we should subject ourselves with
    humility to all our neighbors for God's sake, according to 1 Pt. 2:13, "Be
    ye subject... to every human creature for God's sake"; but to God alone do
    we owe the worship of latria.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If we set what our neighbor has of God's
    above that which we have of our own, we cannot incur falsehood. Wherefore a
    gloss [*St. Augustine, Questions. lxxxiii, qu. 71] on Phil. 2:3, "Esteem
    others better than themselves," says: "We must not esteem by pretending to
    esteem; but we should in truth think it possible for another person to have
    something that is hidden to us and whereby he is better than we are,
    although our own good whereby we are apparently better than he, be not
    hidden."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Humility, like other virtues, resides
    chiefly inwardly in the soul. Consequently a man, by an inward act of the
    soul, may subject himself to another, without giving the other man an
    occasion of detriment to his spiritual welfare. This is what Augustine means
    in his Rule (Ep. ccxi): "With fear, the superior should prostrate himself at
    your feet in the sight of God." On the other hand, due moderation must be
    observed in the outward acts of humility even as of other virtues, lest they
    conduce to the detriment of others. If, however, a man does as he ought, and
    others take therefrom an occasion of sin, this is not imputed to the man who
    acts with humility; since he does not give scandal, although others take
    it.<br />

    Whether humility is a part of modesty or temperance?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that humility is not a part of
    modesty or temperance. For humility regards chiefly the reverence whereby
    one is subject to God, as stated above (<a href="SS161.html#SSQ161A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >). Now it belongs to a theological virtue to have God for its object.
    Therefore humility should be reckoned a theological virtue rather than a
    part of temperance or modesty.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, temperance is in the concupiscible,
    whereas humility would seem to be in the irascible, just as pride which is
    opposed to it, and whose object is something difficult. Therefore apparently
    humility is not a part of temperance or modesty.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, humility and magnanimity are about the
    same object, as stated above (<a href="SS161.html#SSQ161A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, ad 3). But magnanimity is reckoned a part, not of temperance but of
    fortitude, as stated above (<a href="SS129.html#SSQ129OUTP1"
      >Question [129]</a
    >, <a href="SS129.html#SSQ129A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore it would
    seem that humility is not a part of temperance or modesty.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Origen says (Hom. viii super Luc.): "If thou
    wilt hear the name of this virtue, and what it was called by the
    philosophers, know that humility which God regards is the same as what they
    called {metriotes}, i.e. measure or moderation." Now this evidently pertains
    to modesty or temperance. Therefore humility is a part of modesty or
    temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS137.html#SSQ137OUTP1"
      >Question [137]</a
    >, <a href="SS137.html#SSQ137A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1;
    <a href="SS157.html#SSQ157OUTP1">Question [157]</a>,
    <a href="SS157.html#SSQ157A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2), in assigning
    parts to a virtue we consider chiefly the likeness that results from the
    mode of the virtue. Now the mode of temperance, whence it chiefly derives
    its praise, is the restraint or suppression of the impetuosity of a passion.
    Hence whatever virtues restrain or suppress, and the actions which moderate
    the impetuosity of the emotions, are reckoned parts of temperance. Now just
    as meekness suppresses the movement of anger, so does humility suppress the
    movement of hope, which is the movement of a spirit aiming at great things.
    Wherefore, like meekness, humility is accounted a part of temperance. For
    this reason the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 3) says that a man who aims at small
    things in proportion to his mode is not magnanimous but "temperate," and
    such a man we may call humble. Moreover, for the reason given above (<a
      href="SS160.html#SSQ160OUTP1"
      >Question [160]</a
    >, <a href="SS160.html#SSQ160A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), among the various
    parts of temperance, the one under which humility is comprised is modesty as
    understood by Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54), inasmuch as humility is
    nothing else than a moderation of spirit: wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Pt++3%3A4"
      >1 Pt. 3:4</a
    >): "In the incorruptibility of a quiet and meek spirit."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The theological virtues, whose object is
    our last end, which is the first principle in matters of appetite, are the
    causes of all the other virtues. Hence the fact that humility is caused by
    reverence for God does not prevent it from being a part of modesty or
    temperance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Parts are assigned to a principal virtue
    by reason of a sameness, not of subject or matter, but of formal mode, as
    stated above (<a href="SS137.html#SSQ137OUTP1">Question [137]</a>,
    <a href="SS137.html#SSQ137A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1;

    <a href="SS157.html#SSQ157A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2). Consequently,
    although humility is in the irascible as its subject, it is assigned as a
    part of modesty or temperance by reason of its mode.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although humility and magnanimity agree
    as to matter, they differ as to mode, by reason of which magnanimity is
    reckoned a part of fortitude, and humility a part of temperance.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether humility is the greatest of the virtues?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that humility is the greatest of
    the virtues. For Chrysostom, expounding the story of the Pharisee and the
    publican (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++18">Lk. 18</a
    >), says [*Eclog. hom. vii de Humil. Animi.] that "if humility is such a
    fleet runner even when hampered by sin that it overtakes the justice that is
    the companion of pride, whither will it not reach if you couple it with
    justice? It will stand among the angels by the judgment seat of God." Hence
    it is clear that humility is set above justice. Now justice is either the
    most exalted of all the virtues, or includes all virtues, according to the
    Philosopher (Ethic. v, 1). Therefore humility is the greatest of the
    virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Verb. Dom., Serm.
    [*S. 10, C[1]]): "Are you thinking of raising the great fabric of
    spirituality? Attend first of all to the foundation of humility." Now this
    would seem to imply that humility is the foundation of all virtue. Therefore
    apparently it is greater than the other virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the greater virtue deserves the greater
    reward. Now the greatest reward is due to humility, since "he that humbleth
    himself shall be exalted" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++14%3A11"
      >Lk. 14:11</a
    >). Therefore humility is the greatest of virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine (De Vera Relig.
    16), "Christ's whole life on earth was a lesson in moral conduct through the
    human nature which He assumed." Now He especially proposed His humility for
    our example, saying (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++11%3A29"
      >Mt. 11:29</a
    >): "Learn of Me, because I am meek and humble of heart." Moreover, Gregory
    says (Pastor. iii, 1) that the "lesson proposed to us in the mystery of our
    redemption is the humility of God." Therefore humility would seem to be the
    greatest of virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Charity is set above all the virtues,
    according to Col. 3:14, "Above all... things have charity." Therefore
    humility is not the greatest of virtues.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The good of human virtue pertains to the order
    of reason: which order is considered chiefly in reference to the end:
    wherefore the theological virtues are the greatest because they have the
    last end for their object. Secondarily, however, it is considered in
    reference to the ordering of the means to the end. This ordinance, as to its
    essence, is in the reason itself from which it issues, but by participation
    it is in the appetite ordered by the reason; and this ordinance is the
    effect of justice, especially of legal justice. Now humility makes a man a
    good subject to ordinance of all kinds and in all matters; while every other
    virtue has this effect in some special matter. Therefore after the
    theological virtues, after the intellectual virtues which regard the reason
    itself, and after justice, especially legal justice, humility stands before
    all others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Humility is not set before justice, but
    before that justice which is coupled with pride, and is no longer a virtue;
    even so, on the other hand, sin is pardoned through humility: for it is said
    of the publican (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++18%3A14"
      >Lk. 18:14</a
    >) that through the merit of his humility "he went down into his house
    justified." Hence Chrysostom says [*De incompr. Nat. Dei, Hom. v]: "Bring me
    a pair of two-horse chariots: in the one harness pride with justice, in the
    other sin with humility: and you will see that sin outrunning justice wins
    not by its own strength, but by that of humility: while you will see the
    other pair beaten, not by the weakness of justice, but by the weight and
    size of pride."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as the orderly assembly of virtues
    is, by reason of a certain likeness, compared to a building, so again that
    which is the first step in the acquisition of virtue is likened to the
    foundation, which is first laid before the rest of the building. Now the
    virtues are in truth infused by God. Wherefore the first step in the
    acquisition of virtue may be understood in two ways. First by way of
    removing obstacles: and thus humility holds the first place, inasmuch as it
    expels pride, which "God resisteth," and makes man submissive and ever open
    to receive the influx of Divine grace. Hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=James+4%3A6"
      >James 4:6</a
    >): "God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble." In this sense
    humility is said to be the foundation of the spiritual edifice. Secondly, a
    thing is first among virtues directly, because it is the first step towards
    God. Now the first step towards God is by faith, according to Heb. 11:6, "He
    that cometh to God must believe." In this sense faith is the foundation in a
    more excellent way than humility.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To him that despises earthly things,
    heavenly things are promised: thus heavenly treasures are promised to those
    who despise earthly riches, according to Mt. 6:19,20, "Lay not up to
    yourselves treasures on earth... but lay up to yourselves treasures in
    heaven." Likewise heavenly consolations are promised to those who despise
    worldly joys, according to Mt. 4:5, "Blessed are they that mourn, for they
    shall be comforted." In the same way spiritual uplifting is promised to
    humility, not that humility alone merits it, but because it is proper to it
    to despise earthly uplifting. Wherefore Augustine says (De Poenit. [*Serm.
    cccli]): "Think not that he who humbles himself remains for ever abased, for
    it is written: 'He shall be exalted.' And do not imagine that his exaltation
    in men's eyes is effected by bodily uplifting."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The reason why Christ chiefly proposed
    humility to us, was because it especially removes the obstacle to man's
    spiritual welfare consisting in man's aiming at heavenly and spiritual
    things, in which he is hindered by striving to become great in earthly
    things. Hence our Lord, in order to remove an obstacle to our spiritual
    welfare, showed by giving an example of humility, that outward exaltation is
    to be despised. Thus humility is, as it were, a disposition to man's
    untrammeled access to spiritual and divine goods. Accordingly as perfection
    is greater than disposition, so charity, and other virtues whereby man
    approaches God directly, are greater than humility.<br />

    Whether twelve degrees of humility are fittingly distinguished in the Rule
    of the Blessed Benedict?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the twelve degrees of humility
    that are set down in the Rule of the Blessed Benedict [*St. Thomas gives
    these degrees in the reverse order to that followed by St. Benedict] are
    unfittingly distinguished. The first is to be "humble not only in heart, but
    also to show it in one's very person, one's eyes fixed on the ground"; the
    second is "to speak few and sensible words, and not to be loud of voice";
    the third is "not to be easily moved, and disposed to laughter"; the fourth
    is "to maintain silence until one is asked"; the fifth is "to do nothing but
    to what one is exhorted by the common rule of the monastery"; the sixth is
    "to believe and acknowledge oneself viler than all"; the seventh is "to
    think oneself worthless and unprofitable for all purposes"; the eighth is
    "to confess one's sin"; the ninth is "to embrace patience by obeying under
    difficult and contrary circumstances"; the tenth is "to subject oneself to a
    superior"; the eleventh is "not to delight in fulfilling one's own desires";
    the twelfth is "to fear God and to be always mindful of everything that God
    has commanded." For among these there are some things pertaining to the
    other virtues, such as obedience and patience. Again there are some that
    seem to involve a false opinion---and this is inconsistent with any
    virtue---namely to declare oneself more despicable than all men, and to
    confess and believe oneself to be in all ways worthless and unprofitable.
    Therefore these are unfittingly placed among the degrees of humility.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, humility proceeds from within to
    externals, as do other virtues. Therefore in the aforesaid degrees, those
    which concern outward actions are unfittingly placed before those which
    pertain to inward actions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Anselm (De Simil. ci, seqq.) gives seven
    degrees of humility, the first of which is "to acknowledge oneself
    contemptible"; the second, "to grieve for this"; the third, "to confess it";
    the fourth, "to convince others of this, that is to wish them to believe
    it"; the fifth, "to bear patiently that this be said of us"; the sixth, "to
    suffer oneself to be treated with contempt"; the seventh, "to love being
    thus treated." Therefore the aforesaid degrees would seem to be too
    numerous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a gloss on Mt. 3:15 says: "Perfect
    humility has three degrees. The first is to subject ourselves to those who
    are above us, and not to set ourselves above our equals: this is sufficient.
    The second is to submit to our equals, and not to set ourselves before our
    inferiors; this is called abundant humility. The third degree is to subject
    ourselves to inferiors, and in this is perfect righteousness." Therefore the
    aforesaid degrees would seem to be too numerous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Virginit. xxxi): "The
    measure of humility is apportioned to each one according to his rank. It is
    imperiled by pride, for the greater a man is the more liable is he to be
    entrapped." Now the measure of a man's greatness cannot be fixed according
    to a definite number of degrees. Therefore it would seem that it is not
    possible to assign the aforesaid degrees to humility.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS161.html#SSQ161A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >) humility has essentially to do with the appetite, in so far as a man
    restrains the impetuosity of his soul, from tending inordinately to great
    things: yet its rule is in the cognitive faculty, in that we should not deem
    ourselves to be above what we are. Also, the principle and origin of both
    these things is the reverence we bear to God. Now the inward disposition of
    humility leads to certain outward signs in words, deeds, and gestures, which
    manifest that which is hidden within, as happens also with the other
    virtues. For "a man is known by his look, and a wise man, when thou meetest
    him, by his countenance" (Ecclus. 19:26). Wherefore the aforesaid degrees of
    humility include something regarding the root of humility, namely the
    twelfth degree, "that a man fear God and bear all His commandments in
    mind."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, they include certain things with regard to the appetite, lest one aim
    inordinately at one's own excellence. This is done in three ways. First, by
    not following one's own will, and this pertains to the eleventh degree;
    secondly, by regulating it according to one's superior judgment, and this
    applies to the tenth degree; thirdly, by not being deterred from this on
    account of the difficulties and hardships that come in our way, and this
    belongs to the ninth degree.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Certain things also are included referring to the estimate a man forms in
    acknowledging his own deficiency, and this in three ways. First by
    acknowledging and avowing his own shortcomings; this belongs to the eighth
    degree: secondly, by deeming oneself incapable of great things, and this
    pertains to the seventh degree: thirdly, that in this respect one should put
    others before oneself, and this belongs to the sixth degree.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, some things are included that refer to outward signs. One of these
    regards deeds, namely that in one's work one should not depart from the
    ordinary way; this applies to the fifth degree. Two others have reference to
    words, namely that one should not be in a hurry to speak, which pertains to
    the fourth degree, and that one be not immoderate in speech, which refers to
    the second. The others have to do with outward gestures, for instance in
    restraining haughty looks, which regards the first, and in outwardly
    checking laughter and other signs of senseless mirth, and this belongs to
    the third degree.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is possible, without falsehood, to
    deem and avow oneself the most despicable of men, as regards the hidden
    faults which we acknowledge in ourselves, and the hidden gifts of God which
    others have. Hence Augustine says (De Virginit. lii): "Bethink you that some
    persons are in some hidden way better than you, although outwardly you are
    better than they." Again, without falsehood one may avow and believe oneself
    in all ways unprofitable and useless in respect of one's own capability, so
    as to refer all one's sufficiency to God, according to 2 Cor. 3:5, "Not that
    we are sufficient to think anything of ourselves as of ourselves: but our
    sufficiency is from God." And there is nothing unbecoming in ascribing to
    humility those things that pertain to other virtues, since, just as one vice
    arises from another, so, by a natural sequence, the act of one virtue
    proceeds from the act of another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man arrives at humility in two ways.
    First and chiefly by a gift of grace, and in this way the inner man precedes
    the outward man. The other way is by human effort, whereby he first of all
    restrains the outward man, and afterwards succeeds in plucking out the
    inward root. It is according to this order that the degrees of humility are
    here enumerated.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All the degrees mentioned by Anselm are
    reducible to knowledge, avowal, and desire of one's own abasement. For the
    first degree belongs to the knowledge of one's own deficiency; but since it
    would be wrong for one to love one's own failings, this is excluded by the
    second degree. The third and fourth degrees regard the avowal of one's own
    deficiency; namely that not merely one simply assert one's failing, but that
    one convince another of it. The other three degrees have to do with the
    appetite, which seeks, not outward excellence, but outward abasement, or
    bears it with equanimity, whether it consist of words or deeds. For as
    Gregory says (Regist. ii, 10, Ep. 36), "there is nothing great in being
    humble towards those who treat us with regard, for even worldly people do
    this: but we should especially be humble towards those who make us suffer,"
    and this belongs to the fifth and sixth degrees: or the appetite may even go
    so far as lovingly to embrace external abasement, and this pertains to the
    seventh degree; so that all these degrees are comprised under the sixth and
    seventh mentioned above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> These degrees refer, not to the thing
    itself, namely the nature of humility, but to the degrees among men, who are
    either of higher or lower or of equal degree.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> This argument also considers the degrees
    of humility not according to the nature of the thing, in respect of which
    the aforesaid degrees are assigned, but according to the various conditions
    of men.<br />
