    OF THE VIRTUES WHICH ARE CONNECTED WITH PRUDENCE (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    In due sequence, we must consider the virtues that are connected with
    prudence, and which are its quasi-potential parts. Under this head there are
    four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS051.html#SSQ51A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether {euboulia}, is a virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS051.html#SSQ51A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is a special virtue,
    distinct from prudence?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS051.html#SSQ51A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether {synesis} is a special
    virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS051.html#SSQ51A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether {gnome} is a special
    virtue?
  </p>
  <p>
    [*These three Greek words may be rendered as the faculties of deliberating
    well {euboulia}, of judging well according to common law {synesis}, and of
    judging well according to general law {gnome}, respectively.]<br />

    Whether {euboulia} (deliberating well) is a virtue?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that {euboulia} (deliberating well)
    is not a virtue. For, according to Augustine (De Lib. Arb. ii, 18,19) "no
    man makes evil use of virtue." Now some make evil use of {euboulia}
    (deliberating well) or good counsel, either through devising crafty counsels
    in order to achieve evil ends, or through committing sin in order that they
    may achieve good ends, as those who rob that they may give alms. Therefore
    {euboulia} (deliberating well) is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, virtue is a perfection, according to
    Phys. vii. But {euboulia} (deliberating well) is concerned with counsel,
    which implies doubt and research, and these are marks of imperfection.
    Therefore {euboulia} (deliberating well) is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, virtues are connected with one another,
    as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>). Now {euboulia}
    (deliberating well) is not connected with the other virtues, since many
    sinners take good-counsel, and many godly men are slow in taking counsel.
    Therefore {euboulia} (deliberating well) is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 9)
    {euboulia} (deliberating well) "is a right counselling." Now the perfection
    of virtue consists in right reason. Therefore {euboulia} (deliberating well)
    is a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1"
      >Question [47]</a
    >, <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) the nature of a human
    virtue consists in making a human act good. Now among the acts of man, it is
    proper to him to take counsel, since this denotes a research of the reason
    about the actions he has to perform and whereof human life consists, for the
    speculative life is above man, as stated in Ethic. x. But {euboulia}
    (deliberating well) signifies goodness of counsel, for it is derived from
    the {eu}, good, and {boule}, counsel, being "a good counsel" or rather "a
    disposition to take good counsel." Hence it is evident that {euboulia}
    (deliberating well) is a human virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There is no good counsel either in
    deliberating for an evil end, or in discovering evil means for attaining a
    good end, even as in speculative matters, there is no good reasoning either
    in coming to a false conclusion, or in coming to a true conclusion from
    false premisses through employing an unsuitable middle term. Hence both the
    aforesaid processes are contrary to {euboulia} (deliberating well), as the
    Philosopher declares (Ethic. vi, 9).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although virtue is essentially a
    perfection, it does not follow that whatever is the matter of a virtue
    implies perfection. For man needs to be perfected by virtues in all his
    parts, and this not only as regards the acts of reason, of which counsel is
    one, but also as regards the passions of the sensitive appetite, which are
    still more imperfect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It may also be replied that human virtue is a perfection according to the
    mode of man, who is unable by simple insight to comprehend with certainty
    the truth of things, especially in matters of action which are
    contingent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In no sinner as such is {euboulia}
    (deliberating well) to be found: since all sin is contrary to taking good
    counsel. For good counsel requires not only the discovery or devising of fit
    means for the end, but also other circumstances. Such are suitable time, so
    that one be neither too slow nor too quick in taking counsel, and the mode
    of taking counsel, so that one be firm in the counsel taken, and other like
    due circumstances, which sinners fail to observe when they sin. On the other
    hand, every virtuous man takes good counsel in those things which are
    directed to the end of virtue, although perhaps he does not take good
    counsel in other particular matters, for instance in matters of trade, or
    warfare, or the like.<br />

    Whether {euboulia} (deliberating well) is a special virtue, distinct from
    prudence?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that {euboulia} (deliberating well)
    is not a distinct virtue from prudence. For, according to the Philosopher
    (Ethic. vi, 5), the "prudent man is, seemingly, one who takes good counsel."
    Now this belongs to {euboulia} (deliberating well) as stated above.
    Therefore {euboulia} (deliberating well) is not distinct from prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, human acts to which human virtues are
    directed, are specified chiefly by their end, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>, Question [18], Articles [4],6). Now {euboulia}
    (deliberating well) and prudence are directed to the same end, as stated in
    Ethic. vi, 9, not indeed to some particular end, but to the common end of
    all life. Therefore {euboulia} (deliberating well) is not a distinct virtue
    from prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in speculative sciences, research and
    decision belong to the same science. Therefore in like manner these belong
    to the same virtue in practical matters. Now research belongs to {euboulia}
    (deliberating well), while decision belongs to prudence. There {euboulia}
    (deliberating well) is not a distinct virtue from prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Prudence is preceptive, according to Ethic.
    vi, 10. But this does not apply to {euboulia} (deliberating well). Therefore
    {euboulia} (deliberating well) is a distinct virtue from prudence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS051.html#SSQ51A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), virtue is properly directed to an act which it renders good; and
    consequently virtues must differ according to different acts, especially
    when there is a different kind of goodness in the acts. For, if various acts
    contained the same kind of goodness, they would belong to the same virtue:
    thus the goodness of love, desire and joy depends on the same, wherefore all
    these belong to the same virtue of charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now acts of the reason that are ordained to action are diverse, nor have
    they the same kind of goodness: since it is owing to different causes that a
    man acquires good counsel, good judgment, or good command, inasmuch as these
    are sometimes separated from one another. Consequently {euboulia}
    (deliberating well) which makes man take good counsel must needs be a
    distinct virtue from prudence, which makes man command well. And since
    counsel is directed to command as to that which is principal, so {euboulia}
    (deliberating well) is directed to prudence as to a principal virtue,
    without which it would be no virtue at all, even as neither are the moral
    virtues without prudence, nor the other virtues without charity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It belongs to prudence to take good
    counsel by commanding it, to {euboulia} (deliberating well) by eliciting
    it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Different acts are directed in different
    degrees to the one end which is "a good life in general" [*Ethic. vi, 5]:
    for counsel comes first, judgment follows, and command comes last. The last
    named has an immediate relation to the last end: whereas the other two acts
    are related thereto remotely. Nevertheless these have certain proximate ends
    of their own, the end of counsel being the discovery of what has to be done,
    and the end of judgment, certainty. Hence this proves not that {euboulia}
    (deliberating well) is not a distinct virtue from prudence, but that it is
    subordinate thereto, as a secondary to a principal virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even in speculative matters the rational
    science of dialectics, which is directed to research and discovery, is
    distinct from demonstrative science, which decides the truth.<br />

    Whether {synesis} (judging well according to common law) is a virtue?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that {synesis} is not a virtue.
    Virtues are not in us by nature, according to Ethic. ii, 1. But {synesis}
    (judging well according to common law) is natural to some, as the
    Philosopher states (Ethic. vi, 11). Therefore {synesis} (judging well
    according to common law) is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated in the same book (10),
    {synesis} (judging well according to common law) is nothing but "a faculty
    of judging." But judgment without command can be even in the wicked. Since
    then virtue is only in the good, it seems that {synesis} (judging well
    according to common law) is not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there is never a defective command,
    unless there be a defective judgment, at least in a particular matter of
    action; for it is in this that every wicked man errs. If therefore {synesis}
    (judging well according to common law) be reckoned a virtue directed to good
    judgment, it seems that there is no need for any other virtue directed to
    good command: and consequently prudence would be superfluous, which is not
    reasonable. Therefore {synesis} (judging well according to common law) is
    not a virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Judgment is more perfect than counsel. But
    {euboulia}, or good counsel, is a virtue. Much more, therefore, is {synesis}
    (judging well according to common law) a virtue, as being good judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> {synesis} (judging well according to common
    law) signifies a right judgment, not indeed about speculative matters, but
    about particular practical matters, about which also is prudence. Hence in
    Greek some, in respect of {synesis} (judging well according to common law)
    are said to be {synetoi}, i.e. "persons of sense," or {eusynetoi}, i.e. "men
    of good sense," just as on the other hand, those who lack this virtue are
    called {asynetoi}, i.e. "senseless."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, different acts which cannot be ascribed to the same cause, must
    correspond to different virtues. And it is evident that goodness of counsel
    and goodness of judgment are not reducible to the same cause, for many can
    take good counsel, without having good sense so as to judge well. Even so,
    in speculative matters some are good at research, through their reason being
    quick at arguing from one thing to another (which seems to be due to a
    disposition of their power of imagination, which has a facility in forming
    phantasms), and yet such persons sometimes lack good judgment (and this is
    due to a defect in the intellect arising chiefly from a defective
    disposition of the common sense which fails to judge aright). Hence there is
    need, besides {euboulia} (deliberating well), for another virtue, which
    judges well, and this is called {synesis} (judging well according to common
    law).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Right judgment consists in the cognitive
    power apprehending a thing just as it is in reality, and this is due to the
    right disposition of the apprehensive power. Thus if a mirror be well
    disposed the forms of bodies are reflected in it just as they are, whereas
    if it be ill disposed, the images therein appear distorted and misshapen.
    Now that the cognitive power be well disposed to receive things just as they
    are in reality, is radically due to nature, but, as to its consummation, is
    due to practice or to a gift of grace, and this in two ways. First directly,
    on the part of the cognitive power itself, for instance, because it is
    imbued, not with distorted, but with true and correct ideas: this belongs to
    {synesis} (judging well according to common law) which in this respect is a
    special virtue. Secondly indirectly, through the good disposition of the
    appetitive power, the result being that one judges well of the objects of
    appetite: and thus a good judgment of virtue results from the habits of
    moral virtue; but this judgment is about the ends, whereas {synesis}
    (judging well according to common law) is rather about the means.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In wicked men there may be right
    judgment of a universal principle, but their judgment is always corrupt in
    the particular matter of action, as stated above (<a
      href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1"
      >Question [47]</a
    >, <a href="SS047.html#SSQ47A13THEP1">Article [13]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sometimes after judging aright we delay
    to execute or execute negligently or inordinately. Hence after the virtue
    which judges aright there is a further need of a final and principal virtue,
    which commands aright, and this is prudence.<br />

    Whether {gnome} (judging well according to general law) is a special
    virtue?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that {gnome} (judging well
    according to general law) is not a special virtue distinct from {synesis}
    (judging well according to common law). For a man is said, in respect of
    {synesis} (judging well according to common law), to have good judgment. Now
    no man can be said to have good judgment, unless he judge aright in all
    things. Therefore {synesis} (judging well according to common law) extends
    to all matters of judgment, and consequently there is no other virtue of
    good judgment called {gnome} (judging well according to general law).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, judgment is midway between counsel and
    precept. Now there is only one virtue of good counsel, viz. {euboulia}
    (deliberating well) and only one virtue of good command, viz. prudence.
    Therefore there is only one virtue of good judgment, viz. {synesis} (judging
    well according to common law).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, rare occurrences wherein there is need
    to depart from the common law, seem for the most part to happen by chance,
    and with such things reason is not concerned, as stated in Phys. ii, 5. Now
    all the intellectual virtues depend on right reason. Therefore there is no
    intellectual virtue about such matters.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher concludes (Ethic. vi, 11)
    that {gnome} (judging well according to general law) is a special virtue.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    I answer that cognitive habits differ according to higher and lower
    principles: thus in speculative matters wisdom considers higher principles
    than science does, and consequently is distinguished from it; and so must it
    be also in practical matters. Now it is evident that what is beside the
    order of a lower principle or cause, is sometimes reducible to the order of
    a higher principle; thus monstrous births of animals are beside the order of
    the active seminal force, and yet they come under the order of a higher
    principle, namely, of a heavenly body, or higher still, of Divine
    Providence. Hence by considering the active seminal force one could not
    pronounce a sure judgment on such monstrosities, and yet this is possible if
    we consider Divine Providence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it happens sometimes that something has to be done which is not covered
    by the common rules of actions, for instance in the case of the enemy of
    one's country, when it would be wrong to give him back his deposit, or in
    other similar cases. Hence it is necessary to judge of such matters
    according to higher principles than the common laws, according to which
    {synesis} (judging according to common law) judges: and corresponding to
    such higher principles it is necessary to have a higher virtue of judgment,
    which is called {gnome} (judging according to general law), and which
    denotes a certain discrimination in judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> {Synesis} (judging well according to
    common law) judges rightly about all actions that are covered by the common
    rules: but certain things have to be judged beside these common rules, as
    stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Judgment about a thing should be formed
    from the proper principles thereof, whereas research is made by employing
    also common principles. Wherefore also in speculative matters, dialectics
    which aims at research proceeds from common principles; while demonstration
    which tends to judgment, proceeds from proper principles. Hence {euboulia}
    (deliberating well) to which the research of counsel belongs is one for all,
    but not so {synesis} (judging well according to common law) whose act is
    judicial. Command considers in all matters the one aspect of good, wherefore
    prudence also is only one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It belongs to Divine Providence alone to
    consider all things that may happen beside the common course. On the other
    hand, among men, he who is most discerning can judge a greater number of
    such things by his reason: this belongs to {gnome} (judging well according
    to general law), which denotes a certain discrimination in judgment.<br />
