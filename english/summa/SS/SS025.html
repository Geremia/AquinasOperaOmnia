<H3 Align="Center">OF THE OBJECT OF CHARITY (TWELVE ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the object of charity; which consideration will be 
twofold: (1) The things we ought to love out of charity: (2) The order in 
which they ought to be loved. Under the first head there are twelve 
points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether we should love God alone, out of charity, or should we love 
our neighbor also?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether charity should be loved out of charity?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether irrational creatures ought to be loved out of charity?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether one may love oneself out of charity?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether one's own body? 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether sinners should be loved out of charity?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether sinners love themselves?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A8THEP1">(8)</a> Whether we should love our enemies out of charity?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A9THEP1">(9)</a> Whether we are bound to show them tokens of friendship?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A10THEP1">(10)</a> Whether we ought to love the angels out of charity?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A11THEP1">(11)</a> Whether we ought to love the demons?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A12THEP1">(12)</a> How to enumerate the things we are bound to love out of charity.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the love of charity stops at God, or extends to our neighbor?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the love of charity stops at God and does not 
extend to our neighbor. For as we owe God love, so do we owe Him fear, 
according Dt. 10:12: "And now Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require 
of thee, but that thou fear . . . and love Him?" Now the fear with which 
we fear man, and which is called human fear, is distinct from the fear 
with which we fear God, and which is either servile or filial, as is 
evident from what has been stated above (<A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a>, <A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore also the 
love with which we love God, is distinct from the love with which we love 
our neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. viii, 8) that "to be loved 
is to be honored." Now the honor due to God, which is known as "latria," 
is distinct from the honor due to a creature, and known as "dulia." 
Therefore again the love wherewith we love God, is distinct from that 
with which we love our neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, hope begets charity, as a gloss states on Mt. 1:2. Now 
hope is so due to God that it is reprehensible to hope in man, according 
to Jer. 17:5: "Cursed be the man that trusteth in man." Therefore charity 
is so due to God, as not to extend to our neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++4%3A21">1 Jn. 4:21</a>): "This commandment we have 
from God, that he, who loveth God, love also his brother."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>, <A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>; <A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="SS019.html#SSQ19A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54OUTP1">Question [54]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS054.html#FSQ54A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) habits are not differentiated except their acts be of different 
species. For every act of the one species belongs to the same habit. Now 
since the species of an act is derived from its object, considered under 
its formal aspect, it follows of necessity that it is specifically the 
same act that tends to an aspect of the object, and that tends to the 
object under that aspect: thus it is specifically the same visual act 
whereby we see the light, and whereby we see the color under the aspect 
of light.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the aspect under which our neighbor is to be loved, is God, since 
what we ought to love in our neighbor is that he may be in God. Hence it 
is clear that it is specifically the same act whereby we love God, and 
whereby we love our neighbor. Consequently the habit of charity extends 
not only to the love of God, but also to the love of our neighbor. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We may fear our neighbor, even as we may love him, in two 
ways: first, on account of something that is proper to him, as when a man 
fears a tyrant on account of his cruelty, or loves him by reason of his 
own desire to get something from him. Such like human fear is distinct 
from the fear of God, and the same applies to love. Secondly, we fear a 
man, or love him on account of what he has of God; as when we fear the 
secular power by reason of its exercising the ministry of God for the 
punishment of evildoers, and love it for its justice: such like fear of 
man is not distinct from fear of God, as neither is such like love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Love regards good in general, whereas honor regards the 
honored person's own good, for it is given to a person in recognition of 
his own virtue. Hence love is not differentiated specifically on account 
of the various degrees of goodness in various persons, so long as it is 
referred to one good common to all, whereas honor is distinguished 
according to the good belonging to individuals. Consequently we love all 
our neighbors with the same love of charity, in so far as they are 
referred to one good common to them all, which is God; whereas we give 
various honors to various people, according to each one's own virtue, and 
likewise to God we give the singular honor of latria on account of His 
singular virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is wrong to hope in man as though he were the principal 
author of salvation, but not, to hope in man as helping us ministerially 
under God. In like manner it would be wrong if a man loved his neighbor 
as though he were his last end, but not, if he loved him for God's sake; 
and this is what charity does.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity need not be loved out of charity. For 
the things to be loved out of charity are contained in the two precepts 
of charity (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++22%3A37-39">Mt. 22:37-39</a>): and neither of them includes charity, since 
charity is neither God nor our neighbor. Therefore charity need not be 
loved out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, charity is founded on the fellowship of happiness, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But charity cannot participate in happiness. 
Therefore charity need not be loved out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity is a kind of friendship, as stated above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But no man can have friendship for charity or for an accident, 
since such things cannot return love for love, which is essential to 
friendship, as stated in Ethic. viii. Therefore charity need not be loved 
out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. viii, 8): "He that loves his 
neighbor, must, in consequence, love love itself." But we love our 
neighbor out of charity. Therefore it follows that charity  also is loved 
out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Charity is love. Now love, by reason of the nature of the 
power whose act it is, is capable of reflecting on itself; for since the 
object of the will is the universal good, whatever has the aspect of 
good, can be the object of an act of the will: and since to will is 
itself a good, man can will himself to will. Even so the intellect, whose 
object is the true, understands that it understands, because this again 
is something true. Love, however, even by reason of its own species, is 
capable of reflecting on itself, because it is a spontaneous movement of 
the lover towards the beloved, wherefore from the moment a man loves, he 
loves himself to love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet charity is not love simply, but has the nature of friendship, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now by friendship a thing is loved in two 
ways: first, as the friend for whom we have friendship, and to whom we 
wish good things: secondly, as the good which we wish to a friend. It is 
in the latter and not in the former way that charity is loved out of 
charity, because charity is the good which we desire for all those whom 
we love out of charity. The same applies to happiness, and to the other 
virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God and our neighbor are those with whom we are friends, 
but love of them includes the loving of charity, since we love both God 
and our neighbor, in so far as we love ourselves and our neighbor to love 
God, and this is to love charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Charity is itself the fellowship of the spiritual life, 
whereby we arrive at happiness: hence it is loved as the good which we 
desire for all whom we love out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers friendship as referred to those 
with whom we are friends.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether irrational creatures also ought to be loved out of charity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that irrational creatures also ought to be loved 
out of charity. For it is chiefly by charity that we are conformed to 
God. Now God loves irrational creatures out of charity, for He loves "all 
things that are" (Wis. 11:25), and whatever He loves, He loves by Himself 
Who is charity. Therefore we also should love irrational creatures out of 
charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, charity is referred to God principally, and extends to 
other things as referable to God. Now just as the rational creature is 
referable to God, in as much as it bears the resemblance of image, so 
too, are the irrational creatures, in as much as they bear the 
resemblance of a trace [*Cf. FP, Question [45], Article [7]]. Therefore charity extends 
also to irrational creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the object of charity is God. so is the object 
of faith. Now faith extends to irrational creatures,  since we believe 
that heaven and earth were created by God, that the fishes and birds were 
brought forth out of the waters, and animals that walk, and plants, out 
of the earth. Therefore charity extends also to irrational creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The love of charity extends to none but God and our 
neighbor. But the word neighbor cannot be extended to irrational 
creatures, since they have no fellowship with man in the rational life. 
Therefore charity does not extend to irrational creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to what has been stated above (<A Href="SS013.html#SSQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="SS013.html#SSQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) 
charity is a kind of friendship. Now the love of friendship is twofold: 
first, there is the love for the friend to whom our friendship is given, 
secondly, the love for those good things which we desire for our friend. 
With regard to the first, no irrational creature can be loved out of 
charity; and for three reasons. Two of these reasons refer in a general 
way to friendship, which cannot have an irrational creature for its 
object: first because friendship is towards one to whom we wish good 
things, while, properly speaking, we cannot wish good things to an 
irrational creature, because it is not competent, properly speaking, to 
possess good, this being proper to the rational creature which, through 
its free-will, is the master of its disposal of the good it possesses. 
Hence the Philosopher says (Phys. ii, 6) that we do not speak of good or 
evil befalling such like things, except metaphorically. Secondly, because 
all friendship is based on some fellowship in life; since "nothing is so 
proper to friendship as to live together," as the Philosopher proves 
(Ethic. viii, 5). Now irrational creatures can have no fellowship in 
human life which is regulated by reason. Hence friendship with irrational 
creatures is impossible, except metaphorically speaking. The third reason 
is proper to charity, for charity is based on the fellowship of 
everlasting happiness, to which the irrational creature cannot attain. 
Therefore we cannot have the friendship of charity towards an irrational 
creature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless we can love irrational creatures out of charity, if we 
regard them as the good things that we desire for others, in so far, to 
wit, as we wish for their preservation, to God's honor and man's use; 
thus too does God love them out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore the Reply to the First Objection is evident.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The likeness by way of trace does not confer the capacity 
for everlasting life, whereas the likeness of image does: and so the 
comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Faith can extend to all that is in any way true, whereas 
the friendship of charity extends only to such things as have a natural 
capacity for everlasting life; wherefore the comparison fails.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man ought to love himself out of charity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man is bound to love himself out of charity. 
For Gregory says in a homily (In Evang. xvii) that there "can be no 
charity between less than two." Therefore no man has charity towards 
himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, friendship, by its very nature, implies mutual love and 
equality (Ethic. viii, 2,7), which cannot be of one man towards himself. 
But charity is a kind of friendship, as stated above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
Therefore a man cannot have charity towards himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, anything relating to charity cannot be blameworthy, 
since charity "dealeth not perversely" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++23%3A4">1 Cor. 23:4</a>). Now a man deserves 
to be blamed for loving himself, since it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Tim++3%3A1,2">2 Tim. 3:1,2</a>): "In 
the last days shall come dangerous times, men shall be lovers of 
themselves." Therefore a man cannot love himself out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Lev. 19:18): "Thou shalt love thy friend 
as thyself." Now we love our friends out of charity. Therefore we should 
love ourselves too out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since charity is a kind of friendship, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), we may consider charity from two standpoints: first, under 
the general notion of friendship, and in this way we must hold that, 
properly speaking, a man is not a friend to himself, but something more 
than a friend, since friendship implies union, for Dionysius says (Div. 
Nom. iv) that "love is a unitive force," whereas a man is one with 
himself which is more than being united to another. Hence, just as unity 
is the principle of union, so the love with which a man loves himself is 
the form and root of friendship. For if we have friendship with others it 
is because we do unto them as we do unto ourselves, hence we read in 
Ethic. ix, 4,8, that "the origin of friendly relations with others lies 
in our relations to ourselves." Thus too with regard to principles we 
have something greater than science, namely understanding.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we may speak of charity in respect of its specific nature, 
namely as denoting man's friendship with God in the first place, and, 
consequently, with the things of God, among which things is man himself 
who has charity. Hence, among these other things which he loves out of 
charity because they pertain to God, he loves also himself out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gregory speaks there of charity under the general notion of 
friendship: and the Second Objection is to be taken in the same sense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who love themselves are to be blamed, in so far as 
they love themselves as regards their sensitive nature, which they humor. 
This is not to love oneself truly according to  one's rational nature, so 
as to desire for oneself the good things which pertain to the perfection 
of reason: and in this way chiefly it is through charity that a man loves 
himself.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man ought not to love his body out of 
charity. For we do not love one with whom we are unwilling to associate. 
But those who have charity shun the society of the body, according to Rm. 
7:24: "Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" and Phil. 1:23: 
"Having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ." Therefore our 
bodies are not to be loved out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the friendship of charity is based on fellowship in the 
enjoyment of God. But the body can have no share in that enjoyment. 
Therefore the body is not to be loved out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since charity is a kind of friendship it is towards 
those who are capable of loving in return. But our body cannot love us 
out of charity. Therefore it should not be loved out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 23,26) that there 
are four things that we should love out of charity, and among them he 
reckons our own body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Our bodies can be considered in two ways: first, in 
respect of their nature, secondly, in respect of the corruption of sin 
and its punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the nature of our body was created, not by an evil principle, as the 
Manicheans pretend, but by God. Hence we can use it for God's service, 
according to Rm. 6:13: "Present . . . your members as instruments of 
justice unto God." Consequently, out of the love of charity with which we 
love God, we ought to love our bodies also, but we ought not to love the 
evil effects of sin and the corruption of punishment; we ought rather, by 
the desire of charity, to long for the removal of such things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle did not shrink from the society of his body, as 
regards the nature of the body, in fact in this respect he was loth to be 
deprived thereof, according to 2 Cor. 5:4: "We would not be unclothed, 
but clothed over." He did, however, wish to escape from the taint of 
concupiscence, which remains in the body, and from the corruption of the 
body which weighs down the soul, so as to hinder it from seeing God. 
Hence he says expressly: "From the body of this death."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although our bodies are unable to enjoy God by knowing and 
loving Him, yet by the works which we do through the body, we are able to 
attain to the perfect knowledge of God. Hence  from the enjoyment in the 
soul there overflows a certain happiness into the body, viz., "the flush 
of health and incorruption," as Augustine states (Ep. ad Dioscor. 
cxviii). Hence, since the body has, in a fashion, a share of happiness, 
it can be loved with the love of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Mutual love is found in the friendship which is for 
another, but not in that which a man has for himself, either in respect 
of his soul, or in respect of his body.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought not to love sinners out of charity. 
For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++118%3A113">Ps. 118:113</a>): "I have hated the unjust." But David had 
perfect charity. Therefore sinners should be hated rather than loved, out 
of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "love is proved by deeds" as Gregory says in a homily 
for Pentecost (In Evang. xxx). But good men do no works of the unjust: on 
the contrary, they do such as would appear to be works of hate, according 
to Ps. 100:8: "In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land": 
and God commanded (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ex++22%3A18">Ex. 22:18</a>): "Wizards thou shalt not suffer to live." 
Therefore sinners should not be loved out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is part of friendship that one should desire and wish 
good things for one's friends. Now the saints, out of charity, desire 
evil things for the wicked, according to Ps. 9:18: "May the wicked be 
turned into hell [*Douay and A. V.: 'The wicked shall be,' etc. See Reply 
to this Objection.]." Therefore sinners should not be loved out of 
charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[6] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is proper to friends to rejoice in, and will the same 
things. Now charity does not make us will what sinners will, nor to 
rejoice in what gives them joy, but rather the contrary. Therefore 
sinners should not be loved out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[6] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, it is proper to friends to associate together, according 
to Ethic. viii. But we ought not to associate with sinners, according to 
2 Cor. 6:17: "Go ye out from among them." Therefore we should not love 
sinners out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 30) that "when it 
is said: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor,' it is evident that we ought to 
look upon every man as our neighbor." Now sinners do not cease to be men, 
for sin does not destroy nature. Therefore we ought to love sinners out 
of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Two things may be considered in the sinner: his nature 
and his guilt. According to his nature, which he has from God, he has a 
capacity for happiness, on the fellowship of which charity is based, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,5), wherefore we ought to love sinners, 
out of charity, in respect of their nature. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand their guilt is opposed to God, and is an obstacle to 
happiness. Wherefore, in respect of their guilt whereby they are opposed 
to God, all sinners are to be hated, even one's father or mother or 
kindred, according to Lk. 12:26. For it is our duty to hate, in the 
sinner, his being a sinner, and to love in him, his being a man capable 
of bliss; and this is to love him truly, out of charity, for God's sake.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The prophet hated the unjust, as such, and the object of 
his hate was their injustice, which was their evil. Such hatred is 
perfect, of which he himself says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++138%3A22">Ps. 138:22</a>): "I have hated them with a 
perfect hatred." Now hatred of a person's evil is equivalent to love of 
his good. Hence also this perfect hatred belongs to charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As the Philosopher observes (Ethic. ix, 3), when our 
friends fall into sin, we ought not to deny them the amenities of 
friendship, so long as there is hope of their mending their ways, and we 
ought to help them more readily to regain virtue than to recover money, 
had they lost it, for as much as virtue is more akin than money to 
friendship. When, however, they fall into very great wickedness, and 
become incurable, we ought no longer to show them friendliness. It is for 
this reason that both Divine and human laws command such like sinners to 
be put to death, because there is greater likelihood of their harming 
others than of their mending their ways. Nevertheless the judge puts this 
into effect, not out of hatred for the sinners, but out of the love of 
charity, by reason of which he prefers the public good to the life of the 
individual. Moreover the death inflicted by the judge profits the sinner, 
if he be converted, unto the expiation of his crime; and, if he be not 
converted, it profits so as to put an end to the sin, because the sinner 
is thus deprived of the power to sin any more.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Such like imprecations which we come across in Holy Writ, 
may be understood in three ways: first, by way of prediction, not by way 
of wish, so that the sense is: "May the wicked be," that is, "The wicked 
shall be, turned into hell." Secondly, by way of wish, yet so that the 
desire of the wisher is not referred to the man's punishment, but to the 
justice of the punisher, according to Ps. 57:11: "The just shall rejoice 
when he shall see the revenge," since, according to Wis. 1:13, not even 
God "hath pleasure in the destruction of the wicked [Vulg.: 'living']" 
when He punishes them, but He rejoices in His justice, according to Ps. 
10:8: "The Lord is just and hath loved justice." Thirdly, so that this 
desire is referred to the removal of the sin, and not to the punishment 
itself, to the effect, namely, that the sin be destroyed, but that the 
man may live.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[6] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> We love sinners out of charity, not so as to will what they 
will, or to rejoice in what gives them joy, but so as to make them will 
what we will, and rejoice in what rejoices us. Hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jer++15%3A19">Jer. 15:19</a>): "They shall be turned to thee, and thou shalt not to be turned to 
them." 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[6] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The weak should avoid associating with sinners, on account 
of the danger in which they stand of being perverted by them. But it is 
commendable for the perfect, of whose perversion there is no fear, to 
associate with sinners that they may convert them. For thus did Our Lord 
eat and drink with sinners as related by Mt. 9:11-13. Yet all should 
avoid the society of sinners, as regards fellowship in sin; in this sense 
it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++6%3A17">2 Cor. 6:17</a>): "Go out from among them . . . and touch not 
the unclean thing," i.e. by consenting to sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether sinners love themselves?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sinners love themselves. For that which is the 
principle of sin, is most of all in the sinner. Now love of self is the 
principle of sin, since Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 28) that it 
"builds up the city of Babylon." Therefore sinners most of all love 
themselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sin does not destroy nature. Now it is in keeping with 
nature that every man should love himself: wherefore even irrational 
creatures naturally desire their own good, for instance, the preservation 
of their being, and so forth. Therefore sinners love themselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, good is beloved by all, as Dionysius states (Div. Nom. 
iv). Now many sinners reckon themselves to be good. Therefore many 
sinners love themselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++10%3A6">Ps. 10:6</a>): "He that loveth iniquity, 
hateth his own soul."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[7] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Love of self is common to all, in one way; in another way 
it is proper to the good; in a third way, it is proper to the wicked. For 
it is common to all for each one to love what he thinks himself to be. 
Now a man is said to be a thing, in two ways: first, in respect of his 
substance and nature, and, this way all think themselves to be what they 
are, that is, composed of a soul and body. In this way too, all men, both 
good and wicked, love themselves, in so far as they love their own 
preservation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[7] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, a man is said to be something in respect of some predominance, 
as the sovereign of a state is spoken of as being the state, and so, what 
the sovereign does, the state is said to do. In this way, all do not 
think themselves to be what they are. For the reasoning mind is the 
predominant part of man, while the sensitive and corporeal nature takes 
the second place, the former of which the Apostle calls the "inward man," 
and the latter, the "outward man" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++4%3A16">2 Cor. 4:16</a>). Now the good look upon 
their rational nature or the inward man as being the chief thing in them, 
wherefore in this way they think themselves to be what they are. On the 
other hand, the wicked reckon their sensitive and corporeal nature, or 
the outward man, to hold the first place. Wherefore, since they know  not 
themselves aright, they do not love themselves aright, but love what they 
think themselves to be. But the good know themselves truly, and therefore 
truly love themselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[7] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Philosopher proves this from five things that are proper to 
friendship. For in the first place, every friend wishes his friend to be 
and to live; secondly, he desires good things for him; thirdly, he does 
good things to him; fourthly, he takes pleasure in his company; fifthly, 
he is of one mind with him, rejoicing and sorrowing in almost the same 
things. In this way the good love themselves, as to the inward man, 
because they wish the preservation thereof in its integrity, they desire 
good things for him, namely spiritual goods, indeed they do their best to 
obtain them, and they take pleasure in entering into their own hearts, 
because they find there good thoughts in the present, the memory of past 
good, and the hope of future good, all of which are sources of pleasure. 
Likewise they experience no clashing of wills, since their whole soul 
tends to one thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[7] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the wicked have no wish to be preserved in the 
integrity of the inward man, nor do they desire spiritual goods for him, 
nor do they work for that end, nor do they take pleasure in their own 
company by entering into their own hearts, because whatever they find 
there, present, past and future, is evil and horrible; nor do they agree 
with themselves, on account of the gnawings of conscience, according to 
Ps. 49:21: "I will reprove thee and set before thy face."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[7] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same manner it may be shown that the wicked love themselves, as 
regards the corruption of the outward man, whereas the good do not love 
themselves thus.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The love of self which is the principle of sin is that 
which is proper to the wicked, and reaches "to the contempt of God," as 
stated in the passage quoted, because the wicked so desire external goods 
as to despise spiritual goods.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although natural love is not altogether forfeited by wicked 
men, yet it is perverted in them, as explained above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The wicked have some share of self-love, in so far as they 
think themselves good. Yet such love of self is not true but apparent: 
and even this is not possible in those who are very wicked.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether charity requires that we should love our enemies?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity does not require us to love our 
enemies. For Augustine says (Enchiridion lxxiii) that "this great good," 
namely, the love of our enemies, is "not so universal in its application, 
as the object of our petition when we say: Forgive us our trespasses." 
Now no one is forgiven sin without he have charity, because, according to 
Prov. 10:12, "charity covereth  all sins." Therefore charity does not 
require that we should love our enemies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, charity does not do away with nature. Now everything, 
even an irrational being, naturally hates its contrary, as a lamb hates a 
wolf, and water fire. Therefore charity does not make us love our enemies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity "doth nothing perversely" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++13%3A4">1 Cor. 13:4</a>). Now it 
seems perverse to love one's enemies, as it would be to hate one's 
friends: hence Joab upbraided David by saying (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Sam++19%3A6">2 Kgs. 19:6</a>): "Thou lovest 
them that hate thee, and thou hatest them that love thee." Therefore 
charity does not make us love our enemies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Our Lord said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++4%3A44">Mt. 4:44</a>): "Love your enemies."
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[8] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Love of one's enemies may be understood in three ways. 
First, as though we were to love our enemies as such: this is perverse, 
and contrary to charity, since it implies love of that which is evil in 
another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[8] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly love of one's enemies may mean that we love them as to their 
nature, but in general: and in this sense charity requires that we should 
love our enemies, namely, that in loving God and our neighbor, we should 
not exclude our enemies from the love given to our neighbor in general.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[8] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, love of one's enemies may be considered as specially directed 
to them, namely, that we should have a special movement of love towards 
our enemies. Charity does not require this absolutely, because it does 
not require that we should have a special movement of love to every 
individual man, since this would be impossible. Nevertheless charity does 
require this, in respect of our being prepared in mind, namely, that we 
should be ready to love our enemies individually, if the necessity were 
to occur. That man should actually do so, and love his enemy for God's 
sake, without it being necessary for him to do so, belongs to the 
perfection of charity. For since man loves his neighbor, out of charity, 
for God's sake, the more he loves God, the more does he put enmities 
aside and show love towards his neighbor: thus if we loved a certain man 
very much, we would love his children though they were unfriendly towards 
us. This is the sense in which Augustine speaks in the passage quoted in 
the First Objection, the Reply to which is therefore evident.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Everything naturally hates its contrary as such. Now our 
enemies are contrary to us, as enemies, wherefore this itself should be 
hateful to us, for their enmity should displease us. They are not, 
however, contrary to us, as men and capable of happiness: and it is as 
such that we are bound to love them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is wrong to love one's enemies as such: charity does not 
do this, as stated above.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that charity demands of a man to show his enemy the 
signs or effects of love. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Jn++3%3A18">1 Jn. 3:18</a>): "Let us not 
love in word nor in tongue, but in deed and in truth." Now a man loves in 
deed by showing the one he loves signs and effects of love. Therefore 
charity requires that a man show his enemies such signs and effects of 
love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Our Lord said in the same breath (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++5%3A44">Mt. 5:44</a>): "Love your 
enemies," and, "Do good to them that hate you." Now charity demands that 
we love our enemies. Therefore it demands also that we should "do good to 
them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, not only God but also our neighbor is the object of 
charity. Now Gregory says in a homily for Pentecost (In Evang. xxx), that 
"love of God cannot be idle for wherever it is it does great things, and 
if it ceases to work, it is no longer love." Hence charity towards our 
neighbor cannot be without producing works. But charity requires us to 
love our neighbor without exception, though he be an enemy. Therefore 
charity requires us to show the signs and effects of love towards our 
enemies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Mt. 5:44, "Do good to them that hate you," 
says: "To do good to one's enemies is the height of perfection" 
[*Augustine, Enchiridion lxxiii]. Now charity does not require us to do 
that which belongs to its perfection. Therefore charity does not require 
us to show the signs and effects of love to our enemies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[9] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The effects and signs of charity are the result of inward 
love, and are in proportion with it. Now it is absolutely necessary, for 
the fulfilment of the precept, that we should inwardly love our enemies 
in general, but not individually, except as regards the mind being 
prepared to do so, as explained above (<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[9] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must accordingly apply this to the showing of the effects and signs 
of love. For some of the signs and favors of love are shown to our 
neighbors in general, as when we pray for all the faithful, or for a 
whole people, or when anyone bestows a favor on a whole community: and 
the fulfilment of the precept requires that we should show such like 
favors or signs of love towards our enemies. For if we did not so, it 
would be a proof of vengeful spite, and contrary to what is written (Lev. 
19:18): "Seek not revenge, nor be mindful of the injury of thy citizens." 
But there are other favors or signs of love, which one shows to certain 
persons in particular: and it is not necessary for salvation that we show 
our enemies such like favors and signs of love, except as regards being 
ready in our minds, for instance to come to their assistance in a case of 
urgency, according to Prov. 25:21: "If thy enemy be hungry, give him to 
eat; if he thirst, give him . . .  drink." Outside cases of urgency, to 
show such like favors to an enemy belongs to the perfection of charity, 
whereby we not only beware, as in duty bound, of being overcome by evil, 
but also wish to overcome evil by good [*Rm. 12:21], which belongs to 
perfection: for then we not only beware of being drawn into hatred on 
account of the hurt done to us, but purpose to induce our enemy to love 
us on account of our kindliness.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we are not bound to love the angels out of 
charity. For, as Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i), charity is a 
twofold love: the love of God and of our neighbor. Now love of the angels 
is not contained in the love of God, since they are created substances; 
nor is it, seemingly, contained in the love of our neighbor, since they 
do not belong with us to a common species. Therefore we are not bound to 
love them out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[10] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, dumb animals have more in common with us than the angels 
have, since they belong to the same proximate genus as we do. But we have 
not charity towards dumb animals, as stated above (<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Neither, 
therefore, have we towards the angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing is so proper to friends as companionship with 
one another (Ethic. viii, 5). But the angels are not our companions; we 
cannot even see them. Therefore we are unable to give them the friendship 
of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 30): "If the name 
of neighbor is given either to those whom we pity, or to those who pity 
us, it is evident that the precept binding us to love our neighbor 
includes also the holy angels from whom we receive many merciful favors."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[10] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the friendship of charity 
is founded upon the fellowship of everlasting happiness, in which men 
share in common with the angels. For it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++22%3A30">Mt. 22:30</a>) that "in 
the resurrection . . . men shall be as the angels of God in heaven." It 
is therefore evident that the friendship of charity extends also to the 
angels.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Our neighbor is not only one who is united to us in a 
common species, but also one who is united to us by sharing in the 
blessings pertaining to everlasting life, and it is on the latter 
fellowship that the friendship of charity is founded.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Dumb animals are united to us in the proximate genus, by 
reason of their sensitive nature; whereas we are partakers of everlasting 
happiness, by reason not of our sensitive nature but of our rational mind 
wherein we associate with the angels. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[10] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The companionship of the angels does not consist in outward 
fellowship, which we have in respect of our sensitive nature; it consists 
in a fellowship of the mind, imperfect indeed in this life, but perfect 
in heaven, as stated above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether we are bound to love the demons out of charity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[11] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought to love the demons out of charity. 
For the angels are our neighbors by reason of their fellowship with us in 
a rational mind. But the demons also share in our fellowship thus, since 
natural gifts, such as life and understanding, remain in them unimpaired, 
as Dionysius states (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore we ought to love the demons 
out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[11] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the demons differ from the blessed angels in the matter 
of sin, even as sinners from just men. Now the just man loves the sinner 
out of charity. Therefore he ought to love the demons also out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[11] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we ought, out of charity, to love, as being our 
neighbors, those from whom we receive favors, as appears from the passage 
of Augustine quoted above (<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>). Now the demons are useful to us in many 
things, for "by tempting us they work crowns for us," as Augustine says 
(De Civ. Dei xi, 17). Therefore we ought to love the demons out of 
charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[11] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Is++28%3A18">Is. 28:18</a>): "Your league with death 
shall be abolished, and your covenant with hell shall not stand." Now the 
perfection of a peace and covenant is through charity. Therefore we ought 
not to have charity for the demons who live in hell and compass death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[11] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), in the sinner, we are bound, out 
of charity, to love his nature, but to hate his sin. But the name of 
demon is given to designate a nature deformed by sin, wherefore demons 
should not be loved out of charity. Without however laying stress on the 
word, the question as to whether the spirits called demons ought to be 
loved out of charity, must be answered in accordance with the statement 
made above (<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3), that a thing may be loved out of charity in two 
ways. First, a thing may be loved as the person who is the object of 
friendship, and thus we cannot have the friendship of charity towards the 
demons. For it is an essential part of friendship that one should be a 
well-wisher towards one's friend; and it is impossible for us, out of 
charity, to desire the good of everlasting life, to which charity is 
referred, for those spirits whom God has condemned eternally, since this 
would be in opposition to our charity towards God whereby we approve of 
His justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[11] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we love a thing as being that which we desire to be enduring 
as another's good. In this way we love irrational  creatures out of 
charity, in as much as we wish them to endure, to give glory to God and 
be useful to man, as stated above (<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): and in this way too we can love 
the nature of the demons even out of charity, in as much as we desire 
those spirits to endure, as to their natural gifts, unto God's glory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[11] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The possession of everlasting happiness is not impossible 
for the angelic mind as it is for the mind of a demon; consequently the 
friendship of charity which is based on the fellowship of everlasting 
life, rather than on the fellowship of nature, is possible towards the 
angels, but not towards the demons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[11] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In this life, men who are in sin retain the possibility of 
obtaining everlasting happiness: not so those who are lost in hell, who, 
in this respect, are in the same case as the demons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[11] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That the demons are useful to us is due not to their 
intention but to the ordering of Divine providence; hence this leads us 
to be friends, not with them, but with God, Who turns their perverse 
intention to our profit.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether four things are rightly reckoned as to be loved out of charity, viz. God, our neighbor, our body and ourselves?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[12] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that these four things are not rightly reckoned as 
to be loved out of charity, to wit: God, our neighbor, our body, and 
ourselves. For, as Augustine states (Tract. super Joan. lxxxiii), "he 
that loveth not God, loveth not himself." Hence love of oneself is 
included in the love of God. Therefore love of oneself is not distinct 
from the love of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[12] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a part ought not to be condivided with the whole. But 
our body is part of ourselves. Therefore it ought not to be condivided 
with ourselves as a distinct object of love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[12] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as a man has a body, so has his neighbor. Since 
then the love with which a man loves his neighbor, is distinct from the 
love with which a man loves himself, so the love with which a man loves 
his neighbor's body, ought to be distinct from the love with which he 
loves his own body. Therefore these four things are not rightly 
distinguished as objects to be loved out of charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[12] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 23): "There are 
four things to be loved; one which is above us," namely God, "another, 
which is ourselves, a third which is nigh to us," namely our neighbor, 
"and a fourth which is beneath us," namely our own body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[12] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,5), the friendship of 
charity is based on the fellowship of happiness. Now, in this fellowship, 
one thing is considered as the principle from which  happiness flows, 
namely God; a second is that which directly partakes of happiness, namely 
men and angels; a third is a thing to which happiness comes by a kind of 
overflow, namely the human body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[12] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the source from which happiness flows is lovable by reason of its 
being the cause of happiness: that which is a partaker of happiness, can 
be an object of love for two reasons, either through being identified 
with ourselves, or through being associated with us in partaking of 
happiness, and in this respect, there are two things to be loved out of 
charity, in as much as man loves both himself and his neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[12] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The different relations between a lover and the various 
things loved make a different kind of lovableness. Accordingly, since the 
relation between the human lover and God is different from his relation 
to himself, these two are reckoned as distinct objects of love, for the 
love of the one is the cause of the love of the other, so that the former 
love being removed the latter is taken away.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[12] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The subject of charity is the rational mind that can be 
capable of obtaining happiness, to which the body does not reach 
directly, but only by a kind of overflow. Hence, by his reasonable mind 
which holds the first place in him, man, out of charity, loves himself in 
one way, and his own body in another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[25] A[12] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man loves his neighbor, both as to his soul and as to his 
body, by reason of a certain fellowship in happiness. Wherefore, on the 
part of his neighbor, there is only one reason for loving him; and our 
neighbor's body is not reckoned as a special object of love.<br>
