    OF OTHER INJURIES COMMITTED ON THE PERSON (FOUR ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider other sinful injuries committed on the person. Under
    this head there are four points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p><a href="SS065.html#SSQ65A1THEP1">(1)</a> The mutilation of members;</p>
  <p><a href="SS065.html#SSQ65A2THEP1">(2)</a> Blows;</p>
  <p><a href="SS065.html#SSQ65A3THEP1">(3)</a> Imprisonment;</p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS065.html#SSQ65A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the sins that consist in
    inflicting such like injuries are aggravated through being perpetrated on
    persons connected with others?<br />

    Whether in some cases it may be lawful to maim anyone?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in no case can it be lawful to
    maim anyone. For Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv, 20) that "sin consists in
    departing from what is according to nature, towards that which is contrary
    to nature." Now according to nature it is appointed by God that a man's body
    should be entire in its members, and it is contrary to nature that it should
    be deprived of a member. Therefore it seems that it is always a sin to maim
    a person.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as the whole soul is to the whole body,
    so are the parts of the soul to the parts of the body (De Anima ii, 1). But
    it is unlawful to deprive a man of his soul by killing him, except by public
    authority. Therefore neither is it lawful to maim anyone, except perhaps by
    public authority.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the welfare of the soul is to be
    preferred to the welfare of the body. Now it is not lawful for a man to maim
    himself for the sake of the soul's welfare: since the council of Nicea [*P.
    I, sect. 4, can. i] punished those who castrated themselves that they might
    preserve chastity. Therefore it is not lawful for any other reason to maim a
    person.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++21%3A24"
      >Ex. 21:24</a
    >): "Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since a member is part of the whole human body,
    it is for the sake of the whole, as the imperfect for the perfect. Hence a
    member of the human body is to be disposed of according as it is expedient
    for the body. Now a member of the human body is of itself useful to the good
    of the whole body, yet, accidentally it may happen to be hurtful, as when a
    decayed member is a source of corruption to the whole body. Accordingly so
    long as a member is healthy and retains its natural disposition, it cannot
    be cut off without injury to the whole body. But as the whole of man is
    directed as to his end to the whole of the community of which he is a part,
    as stated above (<a href="SS061.html#SSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>,
    <a href="SS061.html#SSQ61A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="SS064.html#SSQ64OUTP1">Question [64]</a>,
    <a href="SS064.html#SSQ64ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,5), it may happen that
    although the removal of a member may be detrimental to the whole body, it
    may nevertheless be directed to the good of the community, in so far as it
    is applied to a person as a punishment for the purpose of restraining sin.
    Hence just as by public authority a person is lawfully deprived of life
    altogether on account of certain more heinous sins, so is he deprived of a
    member on account of certain lesser sins. But this is not lawful for a
    private individual, even with the consent of the owner of the member,
    because this would involve an injury to the community, to whom the man and
    all his parts belong. If, however, the member be decayed and therefore a
    source of corruption to the whole body, then it is lawful with the consent
    of the owner of the member, to cut away the member for the welfare of the
    whole body, since each one is entrusted with the care of his own welfare.
    The same applies if it be done with the consent of the person whose business
    it is to care for the welfare of the person who has a decayed member:
    otherwise it is altogether unlawful to maim anyone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Nothing prevents that which is contrary
    to a particular nature from being in harmony with universal nature: thus
    death and corruption, in the physical order, are contrary to the particular
    nature of the thing corrupted, although they are in keeping with universal
    nature. In like manner to maim anyone, though contrary to the particular
    nature of the body of the person maimed, is nevertheless in keeping with
    natural reason in relation to the common good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The life of the entire man is not
    directed to something belonging to man; on the contrary whatever belongs to
    man is directed to his life. Hence in no case does it pertain to a person to
    take anyone's life, except to the public authority to whom is entrusted the
    procuring of the common good. But the removal of a member can be directed to
    the good of one man, and consequently in certain cases can pertain to
    him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A member should not be removed for the
    sake of the bodily health of the whole, unless otherwise nothing can be done
    to further the good of the whole. Now it is always possible to further one's
    spiritual welfare otherwise than by cutting off a member, because sin is
    always subject to the will: and consequently in no case is it allowable to
    maim oneself, even to avoid any sin whatever. Hence Chrysostom, in his
    exposition on Mt. 19:12 (Hom. lxii in Matth.), "There are eunuchs who have
    made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven," says: "Not by maiming
    themselves, but by destroying evil thoughts, for a man is accursed who maims
    himself, since they are murderers who do such things." And further on he
    says: "Nor is lust tamed thereby, on the contrary it becomes more
    importunate, for the seed springs in us from other sources, and chiefly from
    an incontinent purpose and a careless mind: and temptation is curbed not so
    much by cutting off a member as by curbing one's thoughts."<br />

    Whether it is lawful for parents to strike their children, or masters their
    slaves?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful for parents to strike
    their children, or masters their slaves. For the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++6%3A4"
      >Eph. 6:4</a
    >): "You, fathers, provoke not your children to anger"; and further on (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++9%3A6"
      >Eph. 9:6</a
    >): "And you, masters, do the same thing to your slaves [Vulg.: 'to them']
    forbearing threatenings." Now some are provoked to anger by blows, and
    become more troublesome when threatened. Therefore neither should parents
    strike their children, nor masters their slaves.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 9) that
    "a father's words are admonitory and not coercive." Now blows are a kind of
    coercion. Therefore it is unlawful for parents to strike their children.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, everyone is allowed to impart
    correction, for this belongs to the spiritual almsdeeds, as stated above (<a
      href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/summa/SS/SS032.html#SSQ32OUTP1"
      >Question [32]</a
    >,
    <a
      href="https://isidore.co/aquinas/english/summa/SS/SS032.html#SSQ32A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). If, therefore, it is lawful for parents to strike their children for the
    sake of correction, for the same reason it will be lawful for any person to
    strike anyone, which is clearly false. Therefore the same conclusion
    follows.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++13%3A24"
      >Prov. 13:24</a
    >): "He that spareth the rod hateth his son," and further on (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++23%3A13"
      >Prov. 23:13</a
    >): "Withhold not correction from a child, for if thou strike him with the
    rod, he shall not die. Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and deliver his
    soul from hell." Again it is written (Ecclus. 33:28): "Torture and fetters
    are for a malicious slave."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Harm is done a body by striking it, yet not so
    as when it is maimed: since maiming destroys the body's integrity, while a
    blow merely affects the sense with pain, wherefore it causes much less harm
    than cutting off a member. Now it is unlawful to do a person a harm, except
    by way of punishment in the cause of justice. Again, no man justly punishes
    another, except one who is subject to his jurisdiction. Therefore it is not
    lawful for a man to strike another, unless he have some power over the one
    whom he strikes. And since the child is subject to the power of the parent,
    and the slave to the power of his master, a parent can lawfully strike his
    child, and a master his slave that instruction may be enforced by
    correction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since anger is a desire for vengeance,
    it is aroused chiefly when a man deems himself unjustly injured, as the
    Philosopher states (Rhet. ii). Hence when parents are forbidden to provoke
    their children to anger, they are not prohibited from striking their
    children for the purpose of correction, but from inflicting blows on them
    without moderation. The command that masters should forbear from threatening
    their slaves may be understood in two ways. First that they should be slow
    to threaten, and this pertains to the moderation of correction; secondly,
    that they should not always carry out their threats, that is that they
    should sometimes by a merciful forgiveness temper the judgment whereby they
    threatened punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The greater power should exercise the
    greater coercion. Now just as a city is a perfect community, so the governor
    of a city has perfect coercive power: wherefore he can inflict irreparable
    punishments such as death and mutilation. On the other hand the father and
    the master who preside over the family household, which is an imperfect
    community, have imperfect coercive power, which is exercised by inflicting
    lesser punishments, for instance by blows, which do not inflict irreparable
    harm.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is lawful for anyone to impart
    correction to a willing subject. But to impart it to an unwilling subject
    belongs to those only who have charge over him. To this pertains
    chastisement by blows.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether it is lawful to imprison a man?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful to imprison a man. An act
    which deals with undue matter is evil in its genus, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now man, having a
    free-will, is undue matter for imprisonment which is inconsistent with
    free-will. Therefore it is unlawful to imprison a man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, human justice should be ruled by Divine
    justice. Now according to Ecclus. 15:14, "God left man in the hand of his
    own counsel." Therefore it seems that a man ought not to be coerced by
    chains or prisons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no man should be forcibly prevented
    except from doing an evil deed; and any man can lawfully prevent another
    from doing this. If, therefore, it were lawful to imprison a man, in order
    to restrain him from evil deeds, it would be lawful for anyone to put a man
    in prison; and this is clearly false. Therefore the same conclusion
    follows.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> We read in Lev. 24 that a man was imprisoned
    for the sin of blasphemy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the goods three things may be considered in
    due order. First, the substantial integrity of the body, and this is injured
    by death or maiming. Secondly, pleasure or rest of the senses, and to this
    striking or anything causing a sense of pain is opposed. Thirdly, the
    movement or use of the members, and this is hindered by binding or
    imprisoning or any kind of detention.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore it is unlawful to imprison or in any way detain a man, unless it
    be done according to the order of justice, either in punishment, or as a
    measure of precaution against some evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A man who abuses the power entrusted to
    him deserves to lose it, and therefore when a man by sinning abuses the free
    use of his members, he becomes a fitting matter for imprisonment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to the order of His wisdom God
    sometimes restrains a sinner from accomplishing a sin, according to Job
    5:12: "Who bringeth to nought the designs of the malignant, so that their
    hand cannot accomplish what they had begun, while sometimes He allows them
    to do what they will." In like manner, according to human justice, men are
    imprisoned, not for every sin but for certain ones.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is lawful for anyone to restrain a
    man for a time from doing some unlawful deed there and then: as when a man
    prevents another from throwing himself over a precipice, or from striking
    another. But to him alone who has the right of disposing in general of the
    actions and of the life of another does it belong primarily to imprison or
    fetter, because by so doing he hinders him from doing not only evil but also
    good deeds.<br />

    Whether the sin is aggravated by the fact that the aforesaid injuries are
    perpetrated on those who are connected with others?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the sin is not aggravated by
    the fact that the aforesaid injuries are perpetrated on those who are
    connected with others. Such like injuries take their sinful character from
    inflicting an injury on another against his will. Now the evil inflicted on
    a man's own person is more against his will than that which is inflicted on
    a person connected with him. Therefore an injury inflicted on a person
    connected with another is less grievous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Holy Writ reproves those especially who
    do injuries to orphans and widows: hence it is written (Ecclus. 35:17): "He
    will not despise the prayers of the fatherless, nor the widow when she
    poureth out her complaint." Now the widow and the orphan are not connected
    with other persons. Therefore the sin is not aggravated through an injury
    being inflicted on one who is connected with others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the person who is connected has a will
    of his own just as the principal person has, so that something may be
    voluntary for him and yet against the will of the principal person, as in
    the case of adultery which pleases the woman but not the husband. Now these
    injuries are sinful in so far as they consist in an involuntary commutation.
    Therefore such like injuries are of a less sinful nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++28%3A32"
      >Dt. 28:32</a
    >) as though indicating an aggravating circumstance: "Thy sons and thy
    daughters shall be given to another people, thy eyes looking on [*Vulg.:
    'May thy sons and thy daughters be given,' etc.]."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Other things being equal, an injury is a more
    grievous sin according as it affects more persons; and hence it is that it
    is a more grievous sin to strike or injure a person in authority than a
    private individual, because it conduces to the injury of the whole
    community, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>). Now when an injury
    is inflicted on one who is connected in any way with another, that injury
    affects two persons, so that, other things being equal, the sin is
    aggravated by this very fact. It may happen, however, that in view of
    certain circumstances, a sin committed against one who is not connected with
    any other person, is more grievous, on account of either the dignity of the
    person, or the greatness of the injury.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> An injury inflicted on a person
    connected with others is less harmful to the persons with whom he is
    connected, than if it were perpetrated immediately on them, and from this
    point of view it is a less grievous sin. But all that belongs to the injury
    of the person with whom he is connected, is added to the sin of which a man
    is guilty through injuring the other one in himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Injuries done to widows and orphans are
    more insisted upon both through being more opposed to mercy, and because the
    same injury done to such persons is more grievous to them since they have no
    one to turn to for relief.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The fact that the wife voluntarily
    consents to the adultery, lessens the sin and injury, so far as the woman is
    concerned, for it would be more grievous, if the adulterer oppressed her by
    violence. But this does not remove the injury as affecting her husband,
    since "the wife hath not power of her own body; but the husband" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7%3A4"
      >1 Cor. 7:4</a
    >). The same applies to similar cases. of adultery, however, as it is
