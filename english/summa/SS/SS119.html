    We must now consider prodigality, under which head there are three points of
    inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS119.html#SSQ119A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether prodigality is opposite
    to covetousness?

  <h3 align="left">Whether prodigality is opposite to covetousness?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that prodigality is not opposite to
    covetousness. For opposites cannot be together in the same subject. But some
    are at the same time prodigal and covetous. Therefore prodigality is not
    opposite to covetousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, opposites relate to one same thing. But
    covetousness, as opposed to liberality, relates to certain passions whereby
    man is affected towards money: whereas prodigality does not seem to relate
    to any passions of the soul, since it is not affected towards money, or to
    anything else of the kind. Therefore prodigality is not opposite to
    covetousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sin takes its species chiefly from its
    end, as stated above (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Now prodigality
    seems always to be directed to some unlawful end, for the sake of which the
    prodigal squanders his goods. Especially is it directed to pleasures,
    wherefore it is stated (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++15%3A13"
      >Lk. 15:13</a
    >) of the prodigal son that he "wasted his substance living riotously."
    Therefore it seems that prodigality is opposed to temperance and
    insensibility rather than to covetousness and liberality.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 1)
    that prodigality is opposed to liberality, and illiberality, to which we
    give here the name of covetousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In morals vices are opposed to one another and
    to virtue in respect of excess and deficiency. Now covetousness and
    prodigality differ variously in respect of excess and deficiency. Thus, as
    regards affection for riches, the covetous man exceeds by loving them more
    than he ought, while the prodigal is deficient, by being less careful of
    them than he ought: and as regards external action, prodigality implies
    excess in giving, but deficiency in retaining and acquiring, while
    covetousness, on the contrary, denotes deficiency in giving, but excess in
    acquiring and retaining. Hence it is evident that prodigality is opposed to
    covetousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Nothing prevents opposites from being in
    the same subject in different respects. For a thing is denominated more from
    what is in it principally. Now just as in liberality, which observes the
    mean, the principal thing is giving, to which receiving and retaining are
    subordinate, so, too, covetousness and prodigality regard principally
    giving. Wherefore he who exceeds in giving is said to be "prodigal," while
    he who is deficient in giving is said to be "covetous." Now it happens
    sometimes that a man is deficient in giving, without exceeding in receiving,
    as the Philosopher observes (Ethic. iv, 1). And in like manner it happens
    sometimes that a man exceeds in giving, and therefore is prodigal, and yet
    at the same time exceeds in receiving. This may be due either to some kind
    of necessity, since while exceeding in giving he is lacking in goods of his
    own, so that he is driven to acquire unduly, and this pertains to
    covetousness; or it may be due to inordinateness of the mind, for he gives
    not for a good purpose, but, as though despising virtue, cares not whence or
    how he receives. Wherefore he is prodigal and covetous in different
    respects.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Prodigality regards passions in respect
    of money, not as exceeding, but as deficient in them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The prodigal does not always exceed in
    giving for the sake of pleasures which are the matter of temperance, but
    sometimes through being so disposed as not to care about riches, and
    sometimes on account of something else. More frequently, however, he
    inclines to intemperance, both because through spending too much on other
    things he becomes fearless of spending on objects of pleasure, to which the
    concupiscence of the flesh is more prone; and because through taking no
    pleasure in virtuous goods, he seeks for himself pleasures of the body.
    Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) "that many a prodigal ends in
    becoming intemperate."<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether prodigality is a sin?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that prodigality is not a sin. For the
    Apostle says (1 Tim. 6:10): "Covetousness [Douay: 'desire of money'] is the
    root of all evils." But it is not the root of prodigality, since this is
    opposed to it. Therefore prodigality is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++6%3A17,18"
      >1 Tim. 6:17,18</a
    >): "Charge the rich of this world... to give easily, to communicate to
    others." Now this is especially what prodigal persons do. Therefore
    prodigality is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it belongs to prodigality to exceed in
    giving and to be deficient in solicitude about riches. But this is most
    becoming to the perfect, who fulfil the words of Our Lord (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A34"
      >Mt. 6:34</a
    >), "Be not... solicitous for tomorrow," and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++19%3A21"
      >Mt. 19:21</a
    >), "Sell all [Vulg.: 'what'] thou hast, and give to the poor." Therefore
    prodigality is not a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The prodigal son is held to blame for his
    prodigality.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS119.html#SSQ119A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), the opposition between prodigality and covetousness is one of excess and
    deficiency; either of which destroys the mean of virtue. Now a thing is
    vicious and sinful through corrupting the good of virtue. Hence it follows
    that prodigality is a sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some expound this saying of the Apostle
    as referring, not to actual covetousness, but to a kind of habitual
    covetousness, which is the concupiscence of the "fomes" [*Cf. FS, Question
    [81], Article [3], ad 2], whence all sins arise. Others say that he is
    speaking of a general covetousness with regard to any kind of good: and in
    this sense also it is evident that prodigality arises from covetousness;
    since the prodigal seeks to acquire some temporal good inordinately, namely,
    to give pleasure to others, or at least to satisfy his own will in giving.
    But to one that reviews the passage correctly, it is evident that the
    Apostle is speaking literally of the desire of riches, for he had said
    previously (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++6%3A9"
      >1 Tim. 6:9</a
    >): "They that will become rich," etc. In this sense covetousness is said to
    be "the root of all evils," not that all evils always arise from
    covetousness, but because there is no evil that does not at some time arise
    from covetousness. Wherefore prodigality sometimes is born of covetousness,
    as when a man is prodigal in going to great expense in order to curry favor
    with certain persons from whom he may receive riches.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Apostle bids the rich to be ready to
    give and communicate their riches, according as they ought. The prodigal
    does not do this: since, as the Philosopher remarks (Ethic. iv, 1), "his
    giving is neither good, nor for a good end, nor according as it ought to be.
    For sometimes they give much to those who ought to be poor, namely, to
    buffoons and flatterers, whereas to the good they give nothing."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The excess in prodigality consists
    chiefly, not in the total amount given, but in the amount over and above
    what ought to be given. Hence sometimes the liberal man gives more than the
    prodigal man, if it be necessary. Accordingly we must reply that those who
    give all their possessions with the intention of following Christ, and
    banish from their minds all solicitude for temporal things, are not prodigal
    but perfectly liberal.<br />

    Whether prodigality is a more grievous sin than covetousness?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that prodigality is a more grievous sin
    than covetousness. For by covetousness a man injures his neighbor by not
    communicating his goods to him, whereas by prodigality a man injures
    himself, because the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "the wasting of
    riches, which are the means whereby a man lives, is an undoing of his very
    being." Now he that injures himself sins more grievously, according to
    Ecclus. 14:5, "He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good?"
    Therefore prodigality is a more grievous sin than covetousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a disorder that is accompanied by a
    laudable circumstance is less sinful. Now the disorder of covetousness is
    sometimes accompanied by a laudable circumstance, as in the case of those
    who are unwilling to spend their own, lest they be driven to accept from
    others: whereas the disorder of prodigality is accompanied by a circumstance
    that calls for blame, inasmuch as we ascribe prodigality to those who are
    intemperate, as the Philosopher observes (Ethic. iv, 1). Therefore
    prodigality is a more grievous sin than covetousness.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, prudence is chief among the moral
    virtues, as stated above (<a href="SS056.html#SSQ56OUTP1">Question [56]</a>,
    <a href="SS056.html#SSQ56A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1). Now
    prodigality is more opposed to prudence than covetousness is: for it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++21%3A20"
      >Prov. 21:20</a
    >): "There is a treasure to be desired, and oil in the dwelling of the just;
    and the foolish man shall spend it": and the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 6)
    that "it is the mark of a fool to give too much and receive nothing."
    Therefore prodigality is a more grievous sin than covetousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 6) that "the
    prodigal seems to be much better than the illiberal man."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Prodigality considered in itself is a less
    grievous sin than covetousness, and this for three reasons. First, because
    covetousness differs more from the opposite virtue: since giving, wherein
    the prodigal exceeds, belongs to liberality more than receiving or
    retaining, wherein the covetous man exceeds. Secondly, because the prodigal
    man is of use to the many to whom he gives, while the covetous man is of use
    to no one, not even to himself, as stated in Ethic. iv, 6. Thirdly, because
    prodigality is easily cured. For not only is the prodigal on the way to old
    age, which is opposed to prodigality, but he is easily reduced to a state of
    want, since much useless spending impoverishes him and makes him unable to
    exceed in giving. Moreover, prodigality is easily turned into virtue on
    account of its likeness thereto. On the other hand, the covetous man is not
    easily cured, for the reason given above (<a href="SS118.html#SSQ118OUTP1"
      >Question [118]</a
    >, <a href="SS118.html#SSQ118A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 3).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The difference between the prodigal and
    the covetous man is not that the former sins against himself and the latter
    against another. For the prodigal sins against himself by spending that
    which is his, and his means of support, and against others by spending the
    wherewithal to help others. This applies chiefly to the clergy, who are the
    dispensers of the Church's goods, that belong to the poor whom they defraud
    by their prodigal expenditure. In like manner the covetous man sins against
    others, by being deficient in giving; and he sins against himself, through
    deficiency in spending: wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++6%3A2"
      >Eccles. 6:2</a
    >): "A man to whom God hath given riches... yet doth not give him the power
    to eat thereof." Nevertheless the prodigal man exceeds in this, that he
    injures both himself and others yet so as to profit some; whereas the
    covetous man profits neither others nor himself, since he does not even use
    his own goods for his own profit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In speaking of vices in general, we
    judge of them according to their respective natures: thus, with regard to
    prodigality we note that it consumes riches to excess, and with regard to
    covetousness that it retains them to excess. That one spend too much for the
    sake of intemperance points already to several additional sins, wherefore
    the prodigal of this kind is worse, as stated in Ethic. iv, 1. That an
    illiberal or covetous man refrain from taking what belongs to others,
    although this appears in itself to call for praise, yet on account of the
    motive for which he does so it calls for blame, since he is unwilling to
    accept from others lest he be forced to give to others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All vices are opposed to prudence, even
    as all virtues are directed by prudence: wherefore if a vice be opposed to
    prudence alone, for this very reason it is deemed less grievous.<br />
