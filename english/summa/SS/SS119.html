<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that prodigality is not opposite to covetousness. For 
opposites cannot be together in the same subject. But some are at the 
same time prodigal and covetous. Therefore prodigality is not opposite to 
covetousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, opposites relate to one same thing. But covetousness, as 
opposed to liberality, relates to certain passions whereby man is 
affected towards money: whereas prodigality does not seem to relate to 
any passions of the soul, since it is not affected towards money, or to 
anything else of the kind. Therefore prodigality is not opposite to 
covetousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sin takes its species chiefly from its end, as stated 
above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Now prodigality seems always to be directed to 
some unlawful end, for the sake of which the prodigal squanders his 
goods. Especially is it directed to pleasures, wherefore it is stated 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++15%3A13">Lk. 15:13</a>) of the prodigal son that he "wasted his substance living 
riotously." Therefore it seems that prodigality is opposed to temperance 
and insensibility rather than to covetousness and liberality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 1) that 
prodigality is opposed to liberality, and illiberality, to which we give 
here the name of covetousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In morals vices are opposed to one another and to virtue 
in respect of excess and deficiency. Now covetousness and prodigality 
differ variously in respect of excess and deficiency. Thus, as regards 
affection for riches, the covetous man exceeds by loving them more than 
he ought, while the prodigal is deficient, by being less careful of them 
than he ought: and as regards external action, prodigality implies excess 
in giving, but deficiency in retaining and acquiring, while covetousness, 
on the contrary, denotes deficiency in giving, but excess in acquiring 
and retaining. Hence it is evident that prodigality is opposed to 
covetousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Nothing prevents opposites from being in the same subject 
in different respects. For a thing is denominated more from what is in it 
principally. Now just as in liberality, which observes the mean, the 
principal thing is giving, to which receiving and retaining are 
subordinate, so, too, covetousness and prodigality regard principally 
giving. Wherefore he who exceeds in giving is said to be "prodigal," 
while he who is deficient in giving is said to be "covetous." Now it 
happens sometimes that a man is deficient in giving, without exceeding in 
receiving, as the Philosopher observes (Ethic. iv, 1). And in like manner 
it happens sometimes that a man exceeds in giving, and therefore is 
prodigal, and yet at the same time exceeds in receiving. This may be due  
either to some kind of necessity, since while exceeding in giving he is 
lacking in goods of his own, so that he is driven to acquire unduly, and 
this pertains to covetousness; or it may be due to inordinateness of the 
mind, for he gives not for a good purpose, but, as though despising 
virtue, cares not whence or how he receives. Wherefore he is prodigal and 
covetous in different respects.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Prodigality regards passions in respect of money, not as 
exceeding, but as deficient in them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The prodigal does not always exceed in giving for the sake 
of pleasures which are the matter of temperance, but sometimes through 
being so disposed as not to care about riches, and sometimes on account 
of something else. More frequently, however, he inclines to intemperance, 
both because through spending too much on other things he becomes 
fearless of spending on objects of pleasure, to which the concupiscence 
of the flesh is more prone; and because through taking no pleasure in 
virtuous goods, he seeks for himself pleasures of the body. Hence the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) "that many a prodigal ends in becoming 
intemperate."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether prodigality is a sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that prodigality is not a sin. For the Apostle says (1 
Tim. 6:10): "Covetousness [Douay: 'desire of money'] is the root of all 
evils." But it is not the root of prodigality, since this is opposed to 
it. Therefore prodigality is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++6%3A17,18">1 Tim. 6:17,18</a>): "Charge the rich of 
this world . . . to give easily, to communicate to others." Now this is 
especially what prodigal persons do. Therefore prodigality is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it belongs to prodigality to exceed in giving and to be 
deficient in solicitude about riches. But this is most becoming to the 
perfect, who fulfil the words of Our Lord (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++6%3A34">Mt. 6:34</a>), "Be not . . . 
solicitous for tomorrow," and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++19%3A21">Mt. 19:21</a>), "Sell all [Vulg.: 'what'] thou 
hast, and give to the poor." Therefore prodigality is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The prodigal son is held to blame for his prodigality.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS119.html#SSQ119A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the opposition between 
prodigality and covetousness is one of excess and deficiency; either of 
which destroys the mean of virtue. Now a thing is vicious and sinful 
through corrupting the good of virtue. Hence it follows that prodigality 
is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some expound this saying of the Apostle as referring, not 
to actual covetousness, but to a kind of habitual covetousness, which is 
the concupiscence of the "fomes" [*Cf. FS,  Question [81], Article [3], ad 2], whence 
all sins arise. Others say that he is speaking of a general covetousness 
with regard to any kind of good: and in this sense also it is evident 
that prodigality arises from covetousness; since the prodigal seeks to 
acquire some temporal good inordinately, namely, to give pleasure to 
others, or at least to satisfy his own will in giving. But to one that 
reviews the passage correctly, it is evident that the Apostle is speaking 
literally of the desire of riches, for he had said previously (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Tim++6%3A9">1 Tim. 6:9</a>): "They that will become rich," etc. In this sense covetousness is 
said to be "the root of all evils," not that all evils always arise from 
covetousness, but because there is no evil that does not at some time 
arise from covetousness. Wherefore prodigality sometimes is born of 
covetousness, as when a man is prodigal in going to great expense in 
order to curry favor with certain persons from whom he may receive riches.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Apostle bids the rich to be ready to give and 
communicate their riches, according as they ought. The prodigal does not 
do this: since, as the Philosopher remarks (Ethic. iv, 1), "his giving is 
neither good, nor for a good end, nor according as it ought to be. For 
sometimes they give much to those who ought to be poor, namely, to 
buffoons and flatterers, whereas to the good they give nothing."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The excess in prodigality consists chiefly, not in the 
total amount given, but in the amount over and above what ought to be 
given. Hence sometimes the liberal man gives more than the prodigal man, 
if it be necessary. Accordingly we must reply that those who give all 
their possessions with the intention of following Christ, and banish from 
their minds all solicitude for temporal things, are not prodigal but 
perfectly liberal.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether prodigality is a more grievous sin than covetousness?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that prodigality is a more grievous sin than 
covetousness. For by covetousness a man injures his neighbor by not 
communicating his goods to him, whereas by prodigality a man injures 
himself, because the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "the wasting of 
riches, which are the means whereby a man lives, is an undoing of his 
very being." Now he that injures himself sins more grievously, according 
to Ecclus. 14:5, "He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good?" 
Therefore prodigality is a more grievous sin than covetousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a disorder that is accompanied by a laudable 
circumstance is less sinful. Now the disorder of covetousness is 
sometimes accompanied by a laudable circumstance, as in the case of those 
who are unwilling to spend their own, lest they be driven to accept from 
others: whereas the disorder of prodigality is accompanied by a 
circumstance that calls for blame, inasmuch as we ascribe prodigality to 
those who are intemperate, as the Philosopher observes (Ethic. iv, 1). 
Therefore prodigality is a more grievous sin than covetousness. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, prudence is chief among the moral virtues, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS056.html#SSQ56OUTP1">Question [56]</a>, <A Href="SS056.html#SSQ56A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS061.html#FSQ61A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1). Now prodigality is more 
opposed to prudence than covetousness is: for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Prov++21%3A20">Prov. 21:20</a>): "There is a treasure to be desired, and oil in the dwelling of 
the just; and the foolish man shall spend it": and the Philosopher says 
(Ethic. iv, 6) that "it is the mark of a fool to give too much and 
receive nothing." Therefore prodigality is a more grievous sin than 
covetousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 6) that "the prodigal 
seems to be much better than the illiberal man."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Prodigality considered in itself is a less grievous sin 
than covetousness, and this for three reasons. First, because 
covetousness differs more from the opposite virtue: since giving, wherein 
the prodigal exceeds, belongs to liberality more than receiving or 
retaining, wherein the covetous man exceeds. Secondly, because the 
prodigal man is of use to the many to whom he gives, while the covetous 
man is of use to no one, not even to himself, as stated in Ethic. iv, 6. 
Thirdly, because prodigality is easily cured. For not only is the 
prodigal on the way to old age, which is opposed to prodigality, but he 
is easily reduced to a state of want, since much useless spending 
impoverishes him and makes him unable to exceed in giving. Moreover, 
prodigality is easily turned into virtue on account of its likeness 
thereto. On the other hand, the covetous man is not easily cured, for the 
reason given above (<A Href="SS118.html#SSQ118OUTP1">Question [118]</a>, <A Href="SS118.html#SSQ118A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The difference between the prodigal and the covetous man is 
not that the former sins against himself and the latter against another. 
For the prodigal sins against himself by spending that which is his, and 
his means of support, and against others by spending the wherewithal to 
help others. This applies chiefly to the clergy, who are the dispensers 
of the Church's goods, that belong to the poor whom they defraud by their 
prodigal expenditure. In like manner the covetous man sins against 
others, by being deficient in giving; and he sins against himself, 
through deficiency in spending: wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eccles++6%3A2">Eccles. 6:2</a>): "A 
man to whom God hath given riches . . . yet doth not give him the power 
to eat thereof." Nevertheless the prodigal man exceeds in this, that he 
injures both himself and others yet so as to profit some; whereas the 
covetous man profits neither others nor himself, since he does not even 
use his own goods for his own profit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In speaking of vices in general, we judge of them according 
to their respective natures: thus, with regard to prodigality we note 
that it consumes riches to excess, and with regard to covetousness that 
it retains them to excess. That one spend too much for the sake of 
intemperance points already to several additional sins, wherefore the 
prodigal of this kind is worse, as stated in Ethic. iv, 1. That an 
illiberal or covetous man refrain from taking what belongs to others, 
although this appears in itself to call for praise, yet on account of the 
motive for  which he does so it calls for blame, since he is unwilling to 
accept from others lest he be forced to give to others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[119] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All vices are opposed to prudence, even as all virtues are 
directed by prudence: wherefore if a vice be opposed to prudence alone, 
for this very reason it is deemed less grievous.<br>
