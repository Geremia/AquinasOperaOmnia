    Since virtue is concerned with passions and actions, and since praise and
    censures are apportioned for what is voluntary but pardon—or at times even
    pity—for what is involuntary, the study of the voluntary and the involuntary
    is required of those who intend to treat of virtue.

    The “compulsory action” (<i>violentum</i>) is one whose principle is from
    outside and to which the person involved or the recipient contributes
    nothing, for example, if he is driven somewhere by the wind, or if he is in
    the power other men.

    Some things are done because of the fear of greater evils or because of the
    hope of some good. Thus a tyrant, having in his power the parents or
    children of a certain man commands him to do a disgraceful deed on condition
    that they will be spared if he does it but killed if he does not do it. Here
    a doubt arises whether his actions are voluntary or involuntary. A similar
    case is found in the decision to throw goods overboard during storms at sea.
    Absolutely speaking, no man would do so voluntarily, but if it means that
    his life and that of others are saved as a result, a sensible man will do
    it.

    Operations of this kind are mixed. However, they approach more closely to
    voluntary actions for they are voluntary at the time they are done, and the
    end of the action conforms to this particular time. An action then must be
    called voluntary or involuntary by reference to the time at which it was
    done. In our case he acts voluntarily because the principle moving his
    bodily members in these operations is within te man himself. Actions whose
    source is within man are in his power to do or not to do, and this belongs
    to the nature of the voluntary. But the actions may be called involuntary in
    the abstract (<i>simp1iciter</i>), for no one would choose to do such a
    thing in itself.

    <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OP ST. THOMAS</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    382. After the Philosopher has treated virtue in general, he treats here
    certain principles of virtuous acts. In defining virtue, he said (305) that
    virtue is a habit of correct choosing because virtue works by means of
    choice. Now he logically discusses choice together with the voluntary and
    “willing.” The voluntary is common to these three: for the voluntary is
    anything that is freely done, choice however concerns the things that are
    for the end, and willing considers the end itself. Hence this section falls
    into two parts. In the first part [I] he deals with the three previously
    mentioned principles of virtuous actions. In the second part, at “Since
    willing regards the end etc.” (B. 1113 b 3), he compares these principles
    with the acts of the virtues [Lect. 11]. His initial point calls for a
    threefold procedure. First [A] he determines the voluntary and the
    involuntary. Next [Lect. 5; B], at “After the treatise etc.” (B. 1111 b 4),
    he deals with choice. Last [Lect. 10; C], at “As was stated before etc.”
    (B.1113 a 15), he treats the act of willing. In regard to the first of these
    he does two things. Initially [A’] he shows that it pertains to the present
    discussion to consider the voluntary and the involuntary. Then [B’] at
    “Involuntary actions seem etc..” he actually treats them. Two reasons are
    advanced in proof of the first point.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    383. The first of these reasons [1] is taken from what is peculiar to our
    present study which concerns the virtues. He concludes from his previous
    remarks that moral virtue, our present concern, deals with passions and
    actions in such a way that in the things which are voluntary in regard to
    actions and passions, praise is due anyone acting virtuously and blame for
    anyone acting viciously. But when someone involuntarily performs an action
    in accordance with virtue, he does not merit praise, On the other hand, if
    his action is contrary to virtue he deserves pardon because he acted
    involuntarily, and so is less blameworthy. Sometimes he even deserves pity,
    and should be entirely freed from blame.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    384. Pardon can also be distinguished from pity in this way: we speak of
    pardon when censure, i.e., a penalty is lessened or entirely absolved as a
    consequence of the judgment of reason. Pity, on the other hand, arises as a
    consequence of an emotion. But praise and blame are peculiarly due to virtue
    and vice. Therefore, the voluntary and the involuntary, according to which
    the reason for praise and blame is diversified, ought to be treated by those
    who intend to study virtue.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    385. At “It is useful” [2] he gives the second reason. This is taken from
    the viewpoint of political science to which the present study is ordered. It
    is useful for legislators, he says, to consider the voluntary and the
    involuntary that they may decree honors for the law-abiding and punishments
    for the law-breakers, for in regard to these the distinction of voluntary
    and involuntary is of importance.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    386. Then [B’], at “Involuntary actions seem,” he deals with the voluntary
    and the involuntary. First [B’, I] he treats the involuntary, and second
    [Lect. 4], at “Since the involuntary etc.” (B. 1111 a 22), he treats the
    voluntary. The reason for this order is that the involuntary proceeds from a
    simple cause, as ignorance alone, or violence alone, but the voluntary has
    to take place by the concurrence of many factors. The explanation of the
    involuntary [B’, 1] is achieved in three stages. First [a] he divides the
    involuntary. Second [b], at “The ‘compulsory action’ is etc.,” he treats one
    member of the division. Third [Lect. 3; c], at “Every action done etc.” (B.
    1110 b 18), he treats the other member. He says first that some involuntary
    actions seem to be of two kinds: those arising from violence, or those
    arising from ignorance. This division is made in order to indicate that the
    involuntary is a privation of the voluntary. But the voluntary implies a
    movement of the appetitive power presupposing a knowledge via sense or
    reason because a good perceived moves the appetitive power. A thing is
    involuntary on two accounts: one, because the movement of the appetitive
    power is excluded—this is the involuntary resulting from violence—the other,
    because a mental awareness is excluded-this is the involuntary resulting
    from ignorance.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    387. Next [b], at “The compulsory action,” he deals with the involuntary
    resulting from violence. Here he proceeds in two ways: first [i] he
    discloses what the “compulsory action” (<i>violentum</i>) is. Next [Lect. 2;
    ii], at “If someone should say etc.” (B. 1110 b 9), he rejects an error
    about this. His initial point requires a triple consideration. First [i, x]
    he makes known what the “physically forced action” (<i
      >simpliciter violentum</i
    >) is, and second [i, y], at “Some things are done because of the fear,”
    what the “morally forced action” (<i>violentum secundum quid</i>) is. Third
    [Lect. 2; z], at “What sort of actions etc.” (B. 1110 b), he concludes with
    a summary. He says first that the forced action is one whose principle is
    from outside. It was just noted (385) that violence excludes the appetitive
    movement. Hence, since the appetitive faculty is an intrinsic principle, it
    is appropriate that the forced action arise from an extrinsic principle.
    However, not every action whose principle is from the outside is a forced
    action but only that action which is derived from an extrinsic principle in
    such a way that the interior appetitive faculty does not concur in it. This
    is what he means by his statement that a forced action must be such that a
    man contributes nothing to it by means of his own appetitive faculty. A man
    is here said to be an agent (<i>operans</i>) inasmuch as he does something
    because of violence and a patient inasmuch as he suffers something because
    of violence. Aristotle gives an example: if the air or wind drives a thing
    to some place by its violence, or if rulers having dominion and power exile
    someone against his will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    388. At “Some things” [i, y], he explains what a morally forced action is.
    Three steps clarify this conclusion. First [aa] he raises a doubt. Next
    [bb], at “Operations of this kind etc.,” he solves the doubt. Third [Lect.
    2; cc], at “People doing such actions etc.” (B. 1110 a 19), he clarifies the
    solution. He says first that a man sometimes performs an action because he
    fears to incur greater evils or because he is afraid to lose some good. A
    tyrant, for instance, has under his dominion and power the parents or
    children of a certain man. This tyrant commands the man to do a disgraceful
    deed on condition that if he does it his relatives will be spared; if he
    refuses they will be killed.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    389. There is then a doubt whether things done because of such fear should
    be called voluntary or involuntary. He gives another example of sailors who
    during storms at sea throw merchandise overboard. Absolutely speaking, no
    man does this voluntarily but what he and his shipmates do in order to save
    their lives, any sensible man in a similar situation does.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    390. Then [bb], at “Operations of this kind,” he solves this doubt by
    concluding from his previous remarks (387) that the afore-mentioned actions
    done out of fear are mixed, i.e., have something both of the involuntary
    (inasmuch as no one absolutely wishes to throw his goods overboard) and of
    the voluntary (inasmuch as a sensible man wishes this for the safety of
    himself and others). However, these actions approach more closely to the
    voluntary than to the involuntary. The reason is that throwing merchandise
    overboard, or any action of this kind, can be considered in two ways: one,
    absolutely and in general (involuntary); the other, in the particular
    circumstances occurring at the time the action is to be done (voluntary).
    But, since actions are concerned with particulars, the nature of the action
    must be judged rather according to the considerations of particulars than
    according to the consideration of what is general. This is what he means in
    his statement that these actions were done voluntarily at the time they were
    performed (i.e., after having considered all the particular circumstances
    then occurring), and the end and completion of the action conform to this
    particular time.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    391. Therefore, an action must be properly called voluntary or involuntary
    in view of the time at which the agent performed it. It is obvious that he
    acts voluntarily at the time. This is evident because in these actions the
    principle moving the bodily members to act is within the man himself. It
    would be different, however, if his members were not moved by himself but by
    a more powerful agent. The things done by an intrinsic principle are in the
    power of man to do or not to do, and this belongs to the nature of the
    voluntary. Obviously then actions of this kind are properly and truly
    voluntary. They are, however, involuntary simply, that is considering them
    in general, because no one as far as in him lies would choose to do a thing
    of this kind except out of fear, as was just stated (390).

        What sort of actions then are to be called compulsory? Those actions are
        entirely (<i>simpliciter</i>) compulsory that have their cause from the
        outside, the person involved contributing nothing. Some actions that in
        themselves are involuntary become voluntary in particular circumstances.
        Although of themselves involuntary, if their principle is in the agent
        who seeks them at this time and in these circumstances, they are
        voluntary. They are then more like the voluntary because actions take
        place in particular cases that are voluntary. It is not easy to assign
        the sort of things we must choose in such circumstances, for particular
        cases admit of many differences.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        392. After the Philosopher has solved the doubt raised about the actions
        done because of fear, showing that such actions are voluntary, he now
        clarifies the solution [cc] by explaining that praise and blame, honor
        and punishment are due to voluntary actions of this kind. On this point
        he does two things. First [a’] he discloses in what way these actions
        merit praise and blame, honor and punishment. Next [b’], at “Sometimes
        it is difficult etc.,” he makes known the pending difficulties about
        this. In regard to the first he distinguishes three grades of these
        actions performed by reason of fear, as far as they merit praise or
        blame.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        393. Considering now the first grade [a’, A], he shows that regarding
        such actions, which he says are a mixture of the voluntary and the
        involuntary, some persons are praised for suffering something
        dishonorable—not indeed of a sinful nature but a kind of ignominy —or
        even saddening or grievous in order to persevere in certain great and
        good things, or example, virtuous actions. When the opposite happens
        they are blamed since it seems that only a perverse man suffers very
        dishonorable things, i.e., great disorders in exchange for little or no
        good. No one suffers any evil to preserve a good unless that good is of
        greater value in his estimation than the other goods to which the evil
        he suffers are opposed. It belongs to a disordered desire to prefer
        small goods to great ones that are destroyed by greater evils.
        Therefore, he says this pertains to a perverse man, i.e., one who has a
        disordered desire.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        394. At “Some actions” [a’, B], he sets down the second grade, stating
        that some actions performed because of fear do not deserve praise but
        only pardon. A person should not be blamed very much for doing certain
        things he ought not do, such as actions unbefitting his state. These
        actions should not be considered seriously binding on account of the
        fear of evils beyond human endurance. No one would undergo such evils
        especially for the reason alleged, for example, if some one is
        threatened with punishment by fire unless he tells a jocose lie, or he
        performs some lowly menial tasks unbecoming his dignity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        395. At “Yet it is probable” [a’, c], he treats the third grade. He
        states that other actions are so evil that no amount of force can compel
        them to be done but a man ought to undergo death of the cruelest kind
        rather than do such things, as St. Lawrence endured the roasting on the
        gridiron to avoid sacrificing to idols. The Philosopher affirms this
        either because glory remains after death for one dying for the sake of
        virtue or because courageous perseverance in virtue is so great a good
        that continuance of life—which a man loses by death—cannot equal it. He
        says, therefore, that <i>Alcmaeona</i> or the poems about Alcmaeon
        written by Euripides seem to be satirical. These poems narrate the story
        of Alcmaeon who was forced to kill his mother by the command of his
        father. The father had ordered this when dying in the Theban war to
        which be had gone by the advice of his wife.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        396. Then [b’], at “Sometimes it is,” he brings forward two difficulties
        which threaten the above-mentioned activities. The first of these
        pertains to the judgment of reason [b’, A]. Sometimes it is difficult,
        he says, to judge what is to be chosen so that one may avoid evil and
        what evil is to be endured so that one may not be lacking in some good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        397. The second difficulty [b, B], which he gives at “It is still more,”
        pertains to the stability of the affection. He says that it is even more
        difficult to be steadfast in a reasonable decision that has been made
        than to make a right judgment. He assigns the reason for the difficulty
        saying that—as often happens—the things that are expected are painful,
        i.e., afflicting or sorrowful, but those to which men are forced because
        of fear are disgraceful. It is difficult, however, for a man’s
        affections not to be moved by fear of pain. Since those actions to which
        one is forced by a motive of this kind are disgraceful, it is fitting
        that for those who are forced to do such things by fear of painful
        effects, blame should be forthcoming. Put those who cannot be forced to
        do them are worthy of praise.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        398. Next [i], at “What sort of actions then,” he sums up in conclusion
        the things that have been said and assigns a reason for them. First he
        reviews the principal question, what sort of actions are to be called
        compulsory (<i>violenta</i>). Then, he sums up the answer so far as
        concerns the entirely (absolute) compulsory actions, the cause of which
        is from the outside so that the person involved contributes nothing
        because of violence. Third he gives a resumé of mixed actions. He says
        that those acttions that in themselves, i.e., abstractly
        (<i>absolute</i>) and universally considered, are involuntary become
        voluntary at a definite time and by reason of certain events. Although
        they are involuntary in themselves, their principle is in the agent.
        Therefore, they should be called voluntary at this time and for these
        reasons. Thus it is evident that these actions are more like the
        voluntary than the involuntary because they are voluntary when we
        consider the particular circumstances in which the actions are
        performed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        399. Last, he recapitulates what he had stated about the difficulty
        occurring in things of this kind. He says that it is not easy to assign
        the sort of thing we must choose in such circumstances. He assigns as
        the reason that many differences are found in singulars. Hence the
        judgment of them cannot be comprised under an exact rule but they are to
        be left to the evaluation of a prudent man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        400. At “If someone” [ii], he rejects an error of certain philosophers
        concerning actions done as a result of violence. Because man is what he
        is by reason, it seemed to some that man of himself, and as it were
        voluntarily, does only that which he performs according to reason. But
        when it happens that man acts contrary to reason either on account of
        the desire of some pleasure or greed for some external good, he acts in
        a violent manner. They say, therefore, that pleasurable and external
        goods like riches cause forced actions inasmuch as being external things
        they force man to act against his reason. Aristotle shows this to be
        false for five reasons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        401. The first reason is this [ii, v]. If external things, precisely as
        they are pleasurable and seemingly good, cause violence, it would follow
        that all actions we perform in human affairs are forced actions and none
        is voluntary. (All men do what they do for the sake of these things,
        i.e., for something that is pleasurable or good under a certain aspect.)
        But this is unreasonable. Therefore, the first (that these external
        things cause violence) is also untenable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        402. He sets down the second reason at “Those who act” [ii, w]. All who
        act as a result of violence, act involuntarily and with sadness. Hence
        in the fifth book of the <i>Metaphysics</i> (Ch. 5,1015 a 26 sq.; St.
        Th. Lect. 6, 829-831), it is well said that necessitation is saddening
        because it is opposed to the will. But those who act to acquire
        something enjoyable act with pleasure. They do not then act by violence
        and involuntarily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        403. He gives the third reason at “It is ridiculous” [ii, x]. He says it
        is ridiculous that a man plead as an excuse or blame external goods and
        not accuse himself that he was spared, i.e., permitted himself to be
        overcome by such pleasures. Our will is not of necessity moved by these
        desirable things but it can cling to them or desert them. None possesses
        the nature of a universal and perfect good, as happiness (which everyone
        necessarily wishes) does.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        404. He assigns the fourth reason at “while he takes” [ii, y]. It is
        ridiculous, he says, that a person should call himself the cause of his
        good and virtuous works, and pleasurable things the cause of his
        shameful deeds inasmuch as they induce desire. Aristotle says it is
        ridiculous because directly opposed operations are referred back to the
        same power as a cause. Consequently it is necessary that as reason
        operating according to itself is the cause of virtuous action so also in
        following the passions it should be the cause of vicious action.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        405. He gives the fifth reason at “It seems that” [ii, z], saying that
        the forced action is one whose source is from the outside in such a way
        that he who suffers by reason of it contributes nothing to the action.
        But the man who acts on account of external goods does contribute
        something to the action. Accordingly, although the principle inclining
        his will is from outside, his action is forced neither wholly
        (<i>simpliciter</i>) because he contributes something to the action, nor
        by some mixture because in mixed actions a thing is not rendered simply
        voluntary, as happens here. Therefore, a man acts in that case with
        sadness but not with pleasure, as has been stated (402).

        can he be said to have acted involuntarily if he is not sorry. A man who
        has acted from ignorance and regrets his action seems to have acted
        involuntarily. But if he does not regret it, his case is different; let

        There seems to be a difference between acting on account of and acting
        in ignorance. A drunken or angry person does not act because of
        ignorance but because of one of the things mentioned (drunkenness or
        anger). Such a one however does not act knowingly but in ignorance.
        Therefore, every wicked person acts in ignorance of the things he ought

        is not the cause of an involuntary but of sin. The same may be said of
        ignorance that is of a general nature because a person is blamed for
        such ignorance. But a person who is ignorant of particular conditions

        No one but a madman will be ignorant of all these circumstances. It is
        obvious that no one can be ignorant of the agent. How can he be ignorant

        instance, those speaking out of turn say it escaped them unawares or
        they did not know that certain things were not to be disclosed, like
        Aeschylus when he revealed the sacred mysteries; or someone wishing to

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        406. After the Philosopher has determined the involuntary resulting from
        violence, he now turns his attention to the involuntary resulting from
        ignorance [c]. Concerning it he does two things. First [i] he shows how’
        there is an involuntary resulting from ignorance. Second [ii], at
        “Perhaps it is etc.,” he explains some of his statements. In regard to
        the initial point he sets down three differences concerning ignorance.
        The first of these [i, x] is considered insofar as what is done on
        account of ignorance is rclated to the will in different ways. Sometimes
        it is opposed to the will, and then it is properly called an
        involuntary. But other times it is not opposed to the will but is over
        and above the will precisely as it is unknown. In this sense it is not
        called involuntary but non-voluntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        407. He says then that what is done on account of ignorance in such a
        way that ignorance is the cause, is not voluntary in any case because
        the act of the will is not moved to it. The act of the will cannot be
        moved to what is entirely unknown since the will’s object is the known
        good. But only then is that which is done out of ignorance called
        involuntary—as it were opposed to the will—when on becoming known,
        sorrow and repentance (which is sorrow over one’s past actions) follow.
        A thing is sorrowful because it is opposed to the will, as is stated in
        the fifth book of the Metaphysics (Ch. 5, 1015 a 26 sq.; St. Th. Lect.
        6, 829-830).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        408. One who does something on account of ignorance and is not sorry
        about what he did after he knows it, for instance, if he takes silver
        thinking he took tin, cannot be said to have voluntarily (willingly)
        taken silver since he did not know that it was silver. It cannot be said
        that he involuntarily (unwillingly), i.e., against his will, took silver
        since he is not sorry that he did take silver by reason of ignorance. He
        seems to have acted involuntarily who has sorrow or repents for the fact
        that he took silver by reason of ignorance, just as if someone had, on
        the contrary, taken in thinking he has taken silver. But because he who
        does not repent is different from the man who does repent (he is said to
        be unwilling) let the first be called non-willing. Since he really
        differs from the one who is unwilling, it is better that he have a
        proper and separate name.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        409. He sets down the second difference at “There seems to be” [i, y].
        This is taken according to the difference of what is done in ignorance;
        for ignorance sometimes is the cause of an action, but sometimes the act
        proceeds from another cause. He says that a person acting on account of
        ignorance seems to be different from a person acting in ignorance.
        Sometimes one acts in ignorance but not on account of ignorance. A
        drunken or angry person does not act on account of ignorance but on
        account of drunkenness or anger. Neither of these, however, acts
        knowingly because ignorance is caused at the same time as the action by
        drunkenness and anger. Thus ignorance is concomitant with the action and
        is not its cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        410. From this he concludes that as an angry person acts in ignorance
        and not on account of ignorance but on account of anger, so every wicked
        person acts not indeed on account of ignorance but partly in ignorance
        of the good he ought to do and of the evil he ought to avoid, inasmuch
        as he thinks that at this moment he should do this evil and refrain from
        this good. For this reason he sins because he does what he ought not to
        do. Men who act in ignorance universally become unjust with respect to
        others and wicked with respect to themselves. From this it is evident
        that when someone acts in ignorance, and not on account of ignorance, he
        does not cause an involuntary. The reason is that no one, by reason of
        what he does involuntarily, is unjust or wicked.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        411. He assigns the third difference at “When we speak” [i, z]. This is
        taken from the object of the person’s ignorance. Here we must consider
        that ignorance can be of two kinds. According to one, a person is
        ignorant of what he ought to do or avoid. He says this is ignorance of
        what is fitting—of what he ought to be doing. This ignorance does not
        cause an involuntary because ignorance of this kind cannot happen to a
        man with the use of reason except from negligence. The reason is that
        everyone is bound to be solicitous about knowing what he is obliged to
        do and to avoid. Hence if a man does not wish to avoid (as he is bound)
        ignorance that is considered voluntary, it follows that what is done
        through this ignorance should not be judged involuntary. This is the
        meaning of the saying that one does not wish an involuntary (i.e., what
        is by nature an involuntary) if he is ignorant of what he does, that is,
        of what is suitable under the circumstances. Of this someone can be
        ignorant in two ways:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        412. One is in a particular choice. For instance, because of sensual
        desire a person thinks he should commit fornication at this time. The
        other way is in general, as is evident in one who is of the opinion that
        fornication is always lawful. Both kinds of ignorance concern what is
        done. Hence neither causes an involuntary. This is what is meant by
        saying that that ignorance accompanying choice (by which a person thinks
        he should do this evil at this time) is not the cause of an involuntary
        but is rather the cause of vice or sin. Neither is the ignorance that is
        of a general nature the cause of an involuntary since a person is blamed
        on account of ignorance of this kind. But no one is censured because of
        an involuntary, as was said previously (410).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        413. The other ignorance (the first is in 411) is of singular
        conditions, for instance, that this woman is married, that this man is a
        parent, that this place is holy. It is about these conditions and on
        them that human activity is exercised; by reason of a justifiable
        ignorance of such conditions that a person deserves mercy and pardon
        because he who is ignorant of one of these conditions acts
        involuntarily. Therefore, it is obvious that ignorance of particular
        circumstances of this kind—not however ignorance of what one should
        do—is the cause of an involuntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        414. Then [ii], at “Perhaps it is not,” he explains what he had referred
        to: those circumstances the ignorance of which is a cause of an
        involuntary. In regard to this he does three things. First [ii, x] he
        points out what these circumstances are. Next [ii, y], at “No one but
        etc.,” he shows in what way ignorance of them may be present. Last [ii,
        z], at “Since ignorance can be etc.,” he explains how ignorance of these
        circumstances is the cause of an involuntary. On the first point we must
        consider that circumstances are nothing else but certain particular
        conditions of a human act. These can be taken either on the part of the
        causes of the act or on the part of the act itself. The cause of the act
        is efficient or final. The efficient cause is either the principal or
        the instrumental agent. On the part of the act three things can be
        understood: the genus of the act, the matter or the object itself, and
        the mode of acting. In agreement with this the Philosopher here places
        six circumstances. He says that it is not out of place-indeed it is very
        appropriate-to determine what and how many are these particular
        circumstances, the ignorance of which is the cause of an involuntary. He
        uses an adverb (<i>forsitan</i>) indicating doubt, as in many other
        places of this book because of the uncertainty in moral matters.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        415. Enumerating then these particular things he names “who,” which
        refers to the person of the principal agent; “what is done,” which
        refers to the genus of the act; and “concerning what,” which refers to
        the matter or the object. But he adds also “concerning this”—which
        refers to the measure of the act—as belonging to the agent, i.e., place
        or time, since he says “or in what he operates.” The reason is that all
        external things seem to have relation to the human act. Cicero includes
        what we call “concerning what” under “what.” What is here called “in
        what” he divides into two circumstances: time and place.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        416. So far as concerns the instrumental agent Aristotle adds: sometimes
        also “by what” (<i>quo</i>), for instance an instrument, since not every
        action is performed through an instrument, for example, understanding
        and willing. In place of this some put “by what means” (helps), for one
        to whom help is given uses help as an instrument. Referring to the end
        he says “for the sake of which,” for instance, a doctor cuts for the
        sake of health. Referring to the mode of acting he says “and in what
        manner,” for example, quietly, or violently, that is, strongly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        417. Next [ii, y], at “No one but,” he shows in what way there may be
        ignorance about the preceding circumstances. He says that only a totally
        insane person is ignorant of all these circumstances. Among the other
        circumstances it is obvious that a man cannot be ignorant of what is
        meant by the one acting, because in this case he would be ignorant about
        himself (which is impossible). But someone can be ignorant of what he
        does, as those who disclose things that should not be disclosed say in
        excusing themselves that it slipped their mind or they never knew that
        such things were secret, i.e., were not to be spoken. Thus were revealed
        the sacred mysteries or secrets by Aeschylus, a certain poet. He who
        speaks such things is ignorant of what he does because he does not know
        this is a revelation of secrets.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        418. He gives another example so far as concerns what is done, for
        instance, an archer wishing to teach a pupil how archery is practised
        shoots an arrow into something. Such a one does not know what he does
        because he does not know he is shooting an arrow. Then he exemplifies
        ignorance “concerning what” (<i>circa quid</i>), thus if a man should
        mistake his son for an enemy besieging his home, and kill him, just as a
        certain woman named Merope killed her son. So it is obvious that in a
        case of this kind a man knows what he does because he knows he kills,
        but he does not know the “concerning what” of his act because he does
        not know he kills his son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        419. Then he gives an example of ignorance of the instrument, thus if a
        lancer should use a piked lance that he thought was blunted or if a
        thrower of rocks thinks what he throws are pumice stones.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        420. Farther on he gives an example of ignorance of the end. He says
        that a doctor or a blood-letter lancing a patient to make him better, or
        a teacher striking a pupil to correct him, may take a life. These have
        ignorance of the end, not indeed of what they intended but of what
        followed from their action. They were ignorant that their action would
        lead to such an end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        421. Last, he illustrates ignorance of the manner of the action, for
        instance, a man thinks he is tapping with his fist to show how to hit
        like boxers do but he strikes with force. Such a man strikes with force
        in ignorance or unknowingly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        422. At “Since ignorance can be” [ii, z], he shows how ignorance of the
        previously named things is a cause of the voluntary. First [aa] he says
        that since ignorance can be concerned with any one of the five
        afore-mentioned that concur with the action, that man seems to act
        unwillingly or involuntarily who is ignorant of one of the preceding.
        This does not apply in equal measure to all but it does apply especially
        if the ignorance concerns the most important circumstances.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        423. Next [bb], at “These seem to be,” he shows what he considers the
        most important circumstances. He says that the principal circumstances
        seem to be those on which the act takes place, i.e., the object or the
        matter of the act, and that “for the sake of which” or the end, because
        acts are specified by their objects. just as the matter is the object of
        the external act so the end is the object of the internal act of the
        will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        424. Last [cc], at “For an action,” he says that ignorance of these very
        things is not enough for an involuntary. He states that although an
        action may be called involuntary according to the preceding ignorance, a
        further requirement is that the action be connected with sadness and
        repentance, as was pointed out before (408).

        (5) The irrational passions seem to be truly human. So too then are the

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        425. After the Philosopher has considered the involuntary, he next turns
        his attention to the voluntary. First [I] he shows what the voluntary
        is. Then [II], at “Perhaps it is not accurate etc.,” he dismisses an
        erroneous view of it. On the first point we must consider that although
        the term involuntary seems to indicate the removal of the voluntary,
        nevertheless the causes lead us to understand that a thing is called
        voluntary by reason of the removal of the things causing an involuntary,
        such as violence and ignorance. Because every single thing is known
        through its cause, he gives the definition of the voluntary by taking
        away the cause of the involuntary. He says that since the involuntary
        comes about through physical compulsion and ignorance, as has been
        determined previously (386), the voluntary seems to be: that which the
        agent himself originates (thus violence is excluded) in such a way that
        the agent knows the individual circumstances that concur with the
        action. Thus ignorance as the cause of the involuntary is excluded.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        426. Then [II], at “Perhaps it is,” he rejects an error. First [A] he
        explains it. Certain people were of the opinion that not everything,
        which the agent originates through a knowledge of circumstances, is a
        voluntary. It can happen that that principle which is from within is not
        the rational appetitive faculty called the will (<i>voluntas</i>),
        whence the voluntary receives its name, but a passion of the sensitive
        appetitive faculty, for instance, anger, sensual desire, or something
        else of this kind. This, the Philosopher says, is not an accurate
        statement. It should be noted that because the passions of the sensitive
        appetitive faculty are aroused by external things grasped by means of an
        external sense, this error seems to be of the same nature as the one he
        discarded previously (400-405), according to which it was indicated that
        external things bring about violence. It was imperative to state that in
        that context it was a question of violence, whose origin is external.
        But this must be treated here where it is a question of the voluntary,
        the principle of which is intrinsic, for the passions are within us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        427. Second [B], at “The main reason is,” he rejects this opinion for
        five reasons. Here is his primary reason [a]. Whatever irrational
        animals and children do, they do in conformity with the affections of
        the sensitive faculty, and not in conformity with the rational faculty
        because they lack the use of reason. If then the things that are done
        through anger, sensual desire, and the other affections of the sensitive
        faculty were involuntary it would follow that neither animals nor
        children would act voluntarily. But agents are said to act voluntarily,
        not because they operate under the impulse of the will, but because they
        operate of their own accord by their proper movement in such a way that
        they are not moved by any external thing. It follows then that things
        done by reason of anger or sensual desire are voluntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        428. He gives the second reason at “Are none” [b]. If the things that
        are done because of anger or sensual desire are not voluntary, either
        this is universally true or it is true of evil actions, not of good
        actions, so that the good actions that a person does by reason of
        passion he does voluntarily but the evil actions involuntarily. The
        proponents of this view were probably influenced by the fact that good
        actions conform to and evil actions are opposed to reason. But this
        second supposition seems unacceptable since the one cause of all human
        actions, both good and bad, is the will. A man does not rush to do
        whatsoever is rendered desirable by anger or sensual desire without the
        consent of the rational appetitive faculty. Likewise, the first
        supposition seems unreasonable, namely, that someone should call
        not-voluntary the good things that he ought to seek even according to
        passion, for the reason by means of the will incites to the things we
        ought to seek. We ought to be angry under certain conditions, for
        instance, to curb sin. Likewise we ought to desire certain things, for
        example, health and learning. It remains false then to hold that the
        things done on account of passion are not voluntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        429. He assigns the third reason at “Involuntary things” [c]. It is
        this. Actions resulting from violence are accompanied by sadness, but
        those which are done in agreement with sensual desire are done with
        pleasure. Consequently they are not involuntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        430. The fourth reason given at “Further, what” [d], is this. As has
        been pointed out before (383, 393), voluntary faults are to be censured
        and avoided. This cannot be said of the involuntary because a man is
        neither able to avoid these nor is he censured on account of them. But
        as sins that are committed after reflection, that is, with deliberation,
        are to be avoided and are blameworthy so also sins that are committed on
        account of anger or another passion. A man can, by means of his will,
        resist passion. Hence if he does a disgraceful act because of passion he
        is blamed. Therefore, they do not differ from things done by
        deliberation so far as they are voluntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        431. He assigns the fifth reason at “The irrational passions” [e].
        Irrational passions, i.e., of the sensitive appetitive faculty, seem to
        be human insofar as the sensitive appetitive faculty can obey reason, as
        was stated before (272). Therefore, the actions proceeding from anger,
        sensual desire, and the other passions are human. But no involuntary
        operation is human, for neither praise nor blame are imputed to a man
        who acts involuntarily. Therefore, it is unreasonable to say that things
        done out of passion are involuntary.

        Wishing can be concerned with things not done by oneself, for instance,
        that a man pretending to be an athlete may win, or even that a man who

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        432. After the Philosopher has treated the voluntary and the
        involuntary, he here makes a study of choice. First he gives an
        explanation of choice itself [I], and then [Lect. 7, II] of counsel
        (which is placed in the definition of choice) at “Should men take
        counsel about all things etc.” (B. 1112 a 19). Regarding the initial
        point he does two things. First [A] he shows that it belongs to our
        present study to consider choice. Next [B], at “Choice certainly is
        something,” he investigates the nature of choice. He says first that,
        after the treatise (382-431) on the voluntary and the involuntary, he
        will undertake a passing consideration of choice. Here then he proposes
        briefly the things necessary to study choice. He proves here that it
        belongs to our science to consider choice because choice seems
        especially proper to virtue, which is our principal concern at present.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        433. Its appropriateness is clearly shown by the fact that although both
        inner choice and outward action flow from the habit of virtue, virtuous
        or vicious practices are judged rather by choice than by outward works.
        Every virtuous man chooses good but sometimes he does not do it because
        of some external hindrances. On the other hand the vicious man sometimes
        performs a virtuous deed not out of virtuous choice but out of fear or
        for some unbecoming motive, for instance, vainglory or something else of
        this kind. Hence it obviously pertains to our present purpose to
        consider choice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        434. Then [B], at “Choice certainly” he shows what choice is. First [A’]
        he investigates its genus, and next [B’] its different aspects, at
        “Those who say that choice etc.” Last [Lect. 6, C’], at “What, then, is
        its genus etc.” (B. 1112 a 13), he concludes the definition. The
        voluntary is the genus of choice because it is universally predicated of
        choice and of other things besides. Hence first he says that every
        choice is voluntary, but choice and the voluntary are not identical, for
        the voluntary is more extensive. He proves this in twofold fashion:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        435. The first proof he gives by the words “... participate in
        voluntariety etc.” It is this. Children and the various brutes
        participate in voluntariety inasmuch as of their own accord they do
        things by their own movement, as has been noted above (427). But they do
        not communicate in choice because they do not act with deliberation,
        which is required for choice. Therefore, the voluntary is more extensive
        than choice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        436. He assigns a second reason by the words “Then too the things done
        on the spur of the moment etc.” It is this. The things we do on the spur
        of the moment are called voluntary because their origin is within us.
        However, they are not said to be according to choice because they are
        not done with deliberation. Therefore, the voluntary is more extensive
        than choice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        437. Next [B’], at “Those who say,” he investigates the different
        aspects of choice, proving that choice differs from things with which it
        appears to agree. On this question he does two things. First [1] he
        explains his intent. Then [2], at “Choice does not belong etc.,” he
        proves it. He says first that some philosophers have held that choice is
        sensual desire because both imply a movement of the appetitive faculty
        toward good. Others maintained that choice is anger, perhaps because in
        both there is a certain use of reason. The angry person uses reason
        inasmuch as he judges that an injury received deserves punishment. Still
        others who consider that choice is without passion ascribe choice to the
        rational part, either so far as concerns the appetitive faculty (saying
        it is wishing) or so far as it concerns perception (saying it is
        opinion). In these four states all the principles of human actions are
        included in a simple way: reason to which opinion belongs; the rational
        appetitive faculty that is the will; the sensitive appetitive faculty
        divided into irascible to which belong anger, and concupiscible to which
        belong sensual desire. The Philosopher says, however, that those who
        hold that choice is one of these do not speak accurately.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        438. At “Choice does not” [2], he proves his proposition. He shows first
        [a] that choice is not sensual desire; next [b], at “There is less
        argument etc.,” that it is not anger; third [c], at “Choice is not
        identical etc.,” that it is not wishing; last [Lect. 6, d], that it is
        not opinion, at “Choice is not opinion etc.” (B. 1111 b 31). Regarding
        the first he gives four reasons. The first of these [a, i], common to
        sensual desire and anger, is this. Sensual desire and anger are found
        both among men and brutes. But choice is not met with among the brutes
        as has been said (435). Therefore, choice is neither sensual desire nor
        anger.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        439. He gives the second reason at “The incontinent man” [a, ii]. It is
        this. If choice were sensual desire, whoever acts with choice would act
        with sensual desire. This, however, is false because the incontinent man
        acts in conformity with sensual desire but not in conformity with
        choice, for he does not reasonably direct his choice because of his
        sensual desire. But the continent man on the contrary acts from choice
        and not from sensual desire, which he resists by choice, as will be made
        evident in the seventh book (1143)Therefore, choice is not the same as
        sensual desire.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        440. He assigns the third reason at “Sensual desire is opposed” [a,
        iii]. It is this. Sensual desire is opposed to choice in one who is
        continent or incontinent. One chooses according to reason the opposite
        of that which the other desires according to the sensitive appetitive
        faculty. But the sensual desire in the one is not opposed to the sensual
        desire in the other, because the whole sensual desire of each one tends
        to the same thing, the pleasure of the senses. But this must not be
        understood in the sense that one desire may not be opposed to another.
        We do find desires of contraries, for instance, one man desires to move
        and another to remain in repose. Therefore it is evident that choice is
        not identical with sensual desire.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        441. The fourth reason, given at “Sensual desire is accompanied” [a,
        iv], is this. Sensual desire is always accompanied by pleasure because
        of the presence of the thing desired, or by sorrow because of the
        absence of that thing. Every passion is followed by pleasure or sorrow,
        as has been pointed out in the second book (296). But choice is not
        necessarily associated with pleasure or sorrow, for it can occur without
        any passion by the judgment of reason alone. Therefore, choice is not
        sensual desire.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        442. Then [b], at “There is less argument,” he shows that choice is not
        the same as anger. As to this, he says that there is less argument in
        favor of choice being anger than sensual desire. The reason is that even
        according to appearances the things done from anger do not seem to be
        done by choice because, by reason of the swiftness of the movement of
        wrath, the actions done through anger are very sudden. Although in anger
        there is some use of reason, insofar as the angry person begins to
        attend to his reason as it judges that an injury ought to be avenged,
        nevertheless he does not perfectly heed reason in determining the manner
        and the order of the vengeance. Hence anger especially excludes
        deliberation, which is necessary for choice. But sensual desire does not
        act so suddenly. Hence things done in conformity with sensual desire do
        not seem to be remote from choice as the things done out of anger.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        443. Next [c], at “Choice is not identical,” he explains the difference
        between choice and wish. First [c’ I] he sets forth his proposition.
        Then [c, ii], at “Choice is not concerned etc.,” he proves it. Last [c,
        iii], at “In general, choice,” he deduces the origin of the difference
        between choice and wishing. He says first that choice is not even
        wishing although it seems to be closely connected with wishing. Both
        belong to the one power, the rational appetitive faculty or the will.
        Wishing designates an act of this power related to good absolutely. But
        choice designates an act of the same power related to good according as
        it belongs to an act by which we are ordered to some good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        444. At “Choice is not concerned” [c, ii], he proves the statement by
        three reasons, of which the first is this [x]. Because choice refers to
        our activity, it is said that choice is not concerned with impossible
        things. If a person should say that he chooses something impossible he
        will appear foolish. But wishing can be directed to any good even the
        impossible because it regards good absolutely. Thus a man can wish to be
        immortal, an impossible thing according to the condition of this
        perishable life. Therefore, choice and wish are not the same.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        445. He gives the second reason at “Wishing can be” [y]. The wishing of
        someone can be concerned with things not done by himself. Thus he who is
        a spectator at a duel can wish that a pretender playing an assumed role
        may win (for example, a man who comes into the ring as a boxer when he
        is not a boxer) or even that one who is really an athlete may win. No
        one, however, chooses these things that are done by another but only
        those that he thinks he can do himself. Therefore, choice differs from
        wishing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        446. He assigns the third reason at “Moreover, wishing.” He says that
        wishing is directed rather to the end than to the means because we wish
        the means on account of the end. But that for the sake of which
        something exists is itself greater. But choice concerns only the means
        and not the end itself because the end as already predetermined is
        presupposed. The means, however, are sought by us as things to be
        ordered to the end. Thus we wish health principally since it is the end
        of healing. But we choose the remedies by which we are restored to
        health. Likewise we wish to be happy—happiness is our ultimate end—and
        we say we wish this. Yet it is not suitable to say that we elect or
        choose to be happy. Therefore, choice is not the same as wish.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        447. Then [c, iii], at “In general, choice,” he gives the root of the
        whole difference to which all the previous differences in general are
        referred. He says that choice seems to be directed to the things that
        are within our power. This is the reason why it does not concern
        impossibles, things done by others, nor the end that, for the most part,
        is prearranged for us by nature.

        What then is its genus, what its specific difference, since it is none
        of the things previously mentioned? Seemingly it is a voluntary.
        However, not every voluntary—but certainly the deliberately intentional
        voluntary—is a thing chosen, for choice must be accompanied by reason
        and intellect. Even the name seems to imply that one thing be preferred
        to others.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        448. After the Philosopher has shown that choice is not the same as
        sensual desire; nor anger, which belongs to the sensitive appetitive
        faculty; nor wishing, which belongs to the rational appetitive faculty,
        he here shows [d] that choice is not the same as opinion, which pertains
        to reason itself. He illustrates this point by a threefold
        consideration. First [i] he shows that choice is not the same as opinion
        in general. Next [ii], at “Nor is choice etc.,” he shows that choice is
        not the same as that particular opinion that concerns itself with the
        things we do. Last [iii], at “Whether opinion should be,” he raises a
        doubt (which he leaves unsolved). He says first—this is apparent from
        the premises—that choice is not the same as opinion in general. He
        proves the statement by two reasons, the first of which is this [i, y].
        Opinion can concern everything—no less eternal and impossible things
        than things lying within our power. But choice concerns these things
        only within our capacity, as was just noted (447). Therefore, choice is
        not the same as opinion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        449. He gives the second reason at “Then, too, opinion is divided etc.”
        [i, z]. It is this. The things that are distinguished by various reasons
        are said to differ and not to be the same. Opinion, however, is divided
        into true and false since it pertains to the faculty of knowledge, the
        object of which is the truth. Opinion is not divided into good and bad
        as is the case with choice which belongs to the appetitive faculty, the
        object of which is the good. He concludes from this that choice is not
        the same as opinion in general. This is so obvious that no one affirms
        the contrary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        450. Then [ii], at “Nor is choice,” he shows that choice is not
        identical with that opinion which deals with the things we do. He proves
        this by (five) reasons, the first of which is this [ii, v]. From the
        fact that we choose good or bad things we are said to be such, that is,
        good or bad. But from the fact that we have an opinion about good or bad
        things, or about true or false things, we are not said to be good or
        bad. Therefore choice is not identical with opinion, which refers to
        eligible things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        451. The reason for this difference is that a man is not called good or
        bad on account of his capabilities but on account of his actions (as
        noted in the ninth book of the <i>Metaphysics</i>: Ch. 9, 1051 a 4-15;
        St. Th. Lect. 10, 1883-1885), that is, not because he is able to act
        well but because he does in fact act well. When a man understands
        perfectly he becomes able to act well but he does not yet act well. Thus
        one who has the habit of grammar is able by that very fact to speak
        correctly, but that he actually speak correctly he must will it. The
        reason is that a habit is that quality by which a person acts when he
        wishes, as the Commentator says on the third book <i>De Anima</i>. It is
        obvious then that good will makes a man act well according to every
        capability or habit obedient to reason. Therefore a man is called good
        simply because he has a good will. However, from the fact that he has a
        good intellect he is not called good simply but relatively good, for
        example, a good grammarian or a good musician. Therefore, since choice
        pertains to the will but opinion to the intellect, we are called good or
        bad by reason of choice but not by reason of opinion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        452. He gives the second reason at “We choose to accept” [ii, w]. Choice
        has to do especially with our actions. We choose to accept or reject
        this thing, or whatever else there is that pertains to our actions. But
        opinion principally refers to things. We have an opinion as to what this
        thing is (for instance, what bread is) or what effect it has or how one
        must use it. Opinion, however, does not principally concern our actions,
        for example, that we are of an opinion about accepting or rejecting
        something. The reason is that our actions are particular contingent
        things and quickly passing. Hence a knowledge or opinion of them is not
        often sought for the sake of the truth in them but only because of
        something done. Therefore choice is not identical with opinion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        453. He assigns a third reason at “Choice is” [ii, x]. It is this. The
        good of choice consists in a kind of rectitude, that is, the appetitive
        faculty rightly orders something to an end. This is what he means saying
        that choice is rather praised because it chooses what it ought, as it
        were in the right way, while opinion is praised because it has the truth
        about something. Thus the good and perfection of choice is rectitude but
        the perfection of opinion consists in truth. Things which have different
        perfections are themselves different. Therefore choice is not opinion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        454. The fourth reason, given at “We choose those things” [ii, y], is
        this. Choice is accompanied by certitude, for we choose those things
        which we especially know are good. But opinion lacks certitude, for we
        have an opinion about the things we are not sure are true. Therefore
        choice and opinion are not identical.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        455. He assigns the fifth reason at “And it is not necessarily” [ii, z].
        if opinion and choice were identical, those who make the best choices
        and those who have true opinions about them would necessarily be
        identified. This is obviously false, however, for some men form a true
        opinion in general of what is better but on account of bad will they do
        not choose what is better but what is worse. Therefore choice and
        opinion are not identical.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        456. At “Whether opinion” [iii] he raises a doubt whether opinion should
        be said to precede choice or follow it. He states that it does not
        matter for the present because we do not intend to determine the order
        of these things but only whether choice is identical with a particular
        opinion. Nevertheless, we must know that opinion, since it pertains to
        the faculty of knowledge, strictly speaking, precedes choice pertaining
        to the appetitive faculty, which is moved by the cognoscitive power.
        However, it sometimes happens accidentally that opinion follows choice,
        for instance, when a person on account of the affection for things he
        loves changes the opinion he formerly held.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        457. Then [C’], at “What then,” he shows what choice is. He says that,
        since it is none of the four things previously mentioned, we must
        consider what it is according to its genus and what according to its
        specific difference. As to its genus, seemingly it is a voluntary.
        However, not every voluntary is a thing chosen (as has been pointed out
        before, 434-436), but only the deliberately intentional voluntary. That
        this difference should be given attention is clear from the fact that
        counsel is an act of the reason, and choice itself must be accompanied
        by an act of reason and intellect. The very name—meaning that one be
        accepted rather than another—seems to imply or signify this in a hidden
        way. It pertains to deliberative reason to prefer one to others.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        458. After the Philosopher has finished the treatise on choice, he here
        [II] takes up the question of counsel. First [A] he treats counsel in
        itself; and then [Lect. 9; B], at “The objects of counsel etc.” (B. 1113
        a 3), he treats it in comparison with choice. On the initial point he
        does two things. First [A’] he shows the things about which counsel
        ought to be taken. Next [Lect. 8; B’], at “We do not take counsel about
        ends etc.” (B.1112 b 13), he treats the method and order of taking
        counsel. He handles the first consideration in two steps. First [1] he
        puts forward his proposition; and then [2], he executes it at “...
        about: (1) eternal things etc.” In regard to this first he also does two
        things. Initially [1, a] he proposes the question he intends to treat.
        The question is: should men take counsel about all things in such a way
        that everything is worthy of deliberation, or are some things not
        objects of counsel?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        459. Next [1, b], at “A thing must not,” he explains the proposed
        question with the observation that a thing is not said to be worthy of
        deliberation from the fact that sometimes counsel is taken in the matter
        by some foolish person who perversely uses his reason, or by an insane
        person entirely lacking the use of reason. But something is deemed
        worthy of deliberation inasmuch as men with good sense do deliberate
        about it. Men of this type take counsel only about things that of their
        nature require careful consideration and that are properly said to be
        worthy of deliberation. Foolish people sometimes deliberate even about
        things wherein no counsel is required.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        460. Then [2], at “... about: (1) eternal things,” he shows where
        counsel should function, first [2, a] by distinguishing things according
        to their own causes; next [2, b], at “About certain etc.,” by
        distinguishing things according to every cause; and last [2, c], at
        “Counsel has to concern etc.,” by distinguishing things according to the
        qualities of the things themselves. On the first point he does (three)
        things. First [a, i] he shows where counsel is unnecessary. Then [a,
        ii], at “But we do take counsel etc.,” he infers the areas with which
        counsel does deal. Last [a, iii], at “There is actually etc.,” he shows
        that the conclusion follows from the premises. In regard to the first,
        five considerations require his attention. First [i, v] he says that no
        one takes counsel about eternal things, that is, about things existing
        always and without motion. Examples of this sort are either those, the
        substances of which are not subject to motion (as separated substances
        and the whole universe itself), or those which, even though they exist
        in movable matter, nevertheless according to reason are separated from
        such matter, as mathematical entities. Hence he gives the example of the
        diagonal of a square and its rib or side—no one takes counsel about the
        commensurability of such things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        461. Next [i, w], at “things that are in motion,” he says that no one
        takes counsel even about things that are in action provided their motion
        is always uniform. This uniformity of motion may be either of necessity
        and not by reason of any other cause (as are those things which are of
        themselves necessary) or from the nature of movable bodies or through
        the agency of some separated cause as immaterial substances, movers of
        the heavenly bodies, about which he speaks here. Hence he takes an
        example from the revolutions or circular motions of the sun and its
        risings, and so forth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        462. Third [i, x], at “things that sometimes,” he says that deliberation
        is unnecessary about things in motion and usually following the same
        pattern, even though sometimes in a minor number of cases they happen
        otherwise. Such are the droughts that generally occur in summer and the
        rains that commonly fall in, winter; although this may at times vary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        463. Fourth [i, y], at “things that happen,” he says that counsel is not
        taken about things that happen by chance as the finding of a treasure.
        just as the things spoken of above (461-462) do not depend on our
        action, so things happening by chance cannot depend upon our forethought
        because they are unforeseen and beyond our control.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        464. Fifth [i, z], at “all human things,” he says, as men do not take
        counsel about necessary, natural, and fortuitous things, so neither do
        they take counsel about all human things. Thus the Spartans do not take
        counsel about how the Scythians—who dwell a long way from them—ought
        best to live their lives. He then subjoins a common reason valid in all
        the afore-mentioned cases when he says “None of these things will take
        place etc.,” because none of these things that are necessary or natural
        or fortuitous or done by other men take place by reason of our efforts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        465. Then [a, ii], at “But we do take counsel,” he concludes as it were
        from the premises about the Proper field for counsel. He says that men
        take counsel about practicable things within us, that is, in our power.
        Counsel is ordered to action.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        466. Next [a, iii], at “There is actually,” he shows that this follows
        from the premises because, besides the things just mentioned about which
        it has been indicated that counsel does not apply, there remain these
        situations within us on whose behalf counsel is required. He proves his
        contention by separating the causes. Seemingly there are four causes of
        things: nature, which is the principle of motion either in the case of
        things always moved in the same way or of things for the most part
        preserving uniform motion; necessity, which is the cause of things
        existing always in the same way without motion; fortune, an accidental
        cause outside the intention of the agent, under which is also included
        chance. Besides these causes there is the intellect and whatever else is
        man’s agent, as the will, the senses, and other principles of this kind.
        This cause is different in different men so that each takes counsel
        about those practicable matters which can be done by him. From this it
        follows that counsel is not taken about things done by other causes, as
        already noted (464).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        467. At “About certain” [2, b] he shows about what subjects counsel can
        be taken in the creative arts according to which we do what is within
        our power. On this point he does (three) things. First [b, i] he shows
        in the arts where counsel is taken and where it is unnecessary. He says
        that those creative arts which have a fixed mode of procedure and are
        self-sufficient to the extent that what is done rests on nothing,
        extrinsic do not require counsel, as writing the letters of the
        alphabet. The reason for this is that we deliberate only about doubtful
        matters. And there is no doubt about how a letter should be formed
        because there is a fixed method of writing which is not doubtful and the
        written work depends only on the art and hand of the scribe. But counsel
        is taken about those situations in which we must fix for ourselves in
        advance how to proceed since they are not certain and determined in
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        468. Next [b, ii], at “In these matters,” he shows that in these matters
        counsel is not taken in the same way but that some cases require more
        deliberation and others less. First he explains this difference among
        the creative arts themselves. He states that in those cases in which we
        have the final say, we do not always take counsel in the same way, that
        is, with equal deliberation. We deliberate more about some things which
        are less certain and in which we must take into consideration more
        external things: in the art of medicine we must be mindful of the
        natural strength of the sick person; in business we must assess the
        needs of men and the supply of goods; and in navigation we must take
        into account the winds. In all these, we take more counsel than in
        gymnastics, i.e., the arts of wrestling and exercising that have more
        fixed and determined methods. According as the previously mentioned arts
        are less settled, by so much must we take more counsel in them. The same
        must be understood of other arts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        469. Last [b, iii], at “It is more necessary,” he shows the difference
        relative to the necessity of counsel in the creative arts and in the
        speculative sciences. He indicates that counsel is more necessary in the
        arts (the practicable) than in the sciences (the speculative). In the
        latter, deliberation occurs not in regard to their subject matter, for
        these exist necessarily or by nature, but as regards the use of these
        things, for example, how and in what order we are to proceed in the
        sciences. In this, however, counsel is less mandatory than in the
        practical sciences about which we have more doubts because of the great
        variety occurring in these skills.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        470. Then [2, c], at “Counsel has to,” he shows about which things
        counsel ought to be taken, by considering the qualities of the things
        themselves. On this point he puts forward three qualities of things with
        which counsel deals. First [c, i] he says that counsel has to do with
        things which occur more frequently. However, because they can happen
        otherwise it is uncertain in what way they may take place. If a man
        should wish to deliberate about things that rarely happen, for instance,
        about the possible collapse of a stone bridge over which he must pass,
        he will never get anything done.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        471. Second [c, ii], at “It must concern,” he says that counsel must
        attend to those situations in which no determination has yet been made
        of their outcome. A judge does not take counsel about how he ought to
        pass sentence on the cases stated in the law but rather about cases in
        which something is not determined in the law.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        472. Third [c, iii], at “We invite counsellors,” he says that we take
        others into our confidence for advice in things of importance, as if we
        did not acknowledge our own capability of deciding what we ought to do.
        Thus it is obvious that counsel ought not to be taken about trifling
        things of every kind but only about things of importance.

        give up the project, for instance, if they need money which cannot be
        provided. But if the thing to be done seems practicable, they begin to
        act. Things are called possible that can be done by us; what our friends
        do is done in some way by us, for the origin of their action lies in
        ourselves.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        473. After the Philosopher has shown about what things counsel is taken,
        he here he treats the method and order of taking counsel. Because
        counsel is a kind of inquiry, he does three things concerning it. First
        [1] he shows the method of deliberative inquiry; next [2], at “if those
        taking counsel etc.,” he shows its effect; last [3], at “As has been
        previously stated etc.,” he determines the limit of this inquiry. On the
        initial point he does two things. First [i, a] he proposes a method of
        deliberation. Second [i, b], at “One who takes counsel etc.,” he
        explains his statement. Counsel is a practical deliberation about things
        to be done. Hence as in a speculative inquiry, where principles are
        necessarily taken for granted and certain other things are sought, so
        also should it be with counsel. Therefore, he shows first [a, i] what is
        taken for granted regarding counsel. Second [a, ii], at “But having
        taken etc.,” he shows what is the objective in taking counsel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        474. We must consider that in practicable things the end holds the place
        of the principle because the necessity of practicable things depends on
        the end, as has been mentioned in the second book of the
        <i>Physics</i> (Ch. 9, 200 a 15 sq.; St. Th. Lect. 15, 273-274). On this
        account we must take the end for granted. This is what he means when he
        says that we do not take counsel about ends but about the means to the
        end. Thus in speculative matters we do not inquire about the principles
        but about the conclusions. He clarifies what he has said by examples: a
        doctor does not deliberate whether he ought to cure a patient but this
        is taken for granted as an end; an orator does not deliberate whether he
        ought to persuade people, for he intends this as an end; a statesman or
        a ruler of the state does not deliberate whether he ought to achieve
        peace which is compared to the state as health to the human body (health
        consists in the harmony of the humors as peace consists in the harmony
        of wills). Neither does any other agent take counsel about the end in
        this way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        475. Then [a, ii], at “But having take, the end for granted,” he shows
        about what and how deliberative inquiry should be made. He introduces
        three things concerning this. The first of these is that, having taken
        the end for granted, the primary intention of the one taking counsel is
        how (i.e., by what motion or action) he can attain that end, and by what
        means he must move or work toward the end, as by horse or ship. His next
        intention is—when he can attain some end by several things, either
        instruments or actions—to know by which of these he can better and more
        easily achieve his goal. This pertains to judgment in finding ways to
        the end in which some men are at times deficient. His last intention
        is—if it should happen that the end can be attained by one means or
        motion alone, or most aptly by a particular means—that the end be
        procured in such a way that it is reached through this means. For this,
        perseverance and care are necessary. If the means for attaining the end
        should not be at hand, we must inquire how it can be gained and so on
        until we arrive at a cause which holds first place in operating (this
        will be last in the order of discovery).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        476. Next [i, b], at “One who,” he further clarifies his statement by
        its likeness to speculative inquiry. He says that the cause that is
        first in operation is the last in the order of discovery because one who
        deliberates seems to inquire (as was just pointed out in 473) by some
        analytic method, just as he who wishes to prove a conclusion by a
        diagram or a geometrical explanation must resolve the conclusion into
        principles until he reaches the first indemonstrable principles. All
        counsel is an investigation, i.e., a kind of inquiry, although not every
        investigation or inquiry is counsel, for example, an inquiry in
        mathematics. Only an inquiry about practicable things is counsel.
        Because the man who takes counsel inquires in an analytic manner, his
        inquiry must lead to that which is the principle in operation. The
        reason is that what is last in analysis is first in production or
        activity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        477. At “If those taking counsel” [2] he shows the effect of counsel.
        First [2, a] he exposes his proposition. Second [2, b] he explains
        certain things that were said by the words “At times we inquire etc.” He
        says first that if those taking counsel, on reaching the point in the
        deliberative inquiry where the first operation must be done, find this
        impossible they give up, i.e., dismiss the whole matter as if without
        hope of success. For example, if in order to carry out a business
        venture, a man needs money to pay certain persons and he cannot pay it,
        he must abandon the project. But if it is apparent that what was
        discovered by means of counsel is possible, operation begins immediately
        because, as was just mentioned (476), the point at which the analytic
        inquiry of counsel ends must be the beginning of operation. A thing is
        said to be possible to an agent not only through his own power but also
        through the power of others. Hence things done by friends are enumerated
        by him among possibles because what our friends do is done in some way
        by us, inasmuch as the principle of the work is found in us, for they
        themselves do this in consideration of us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        478. Then [2, b], when he says “At times we inquire,” he explains his
        previous statement, namely, the kinds of things that upon investigation
        we sometimes find possible and sometimes impossible. At times, he says,
        by counsel we inquire about instruments, for instance, a horse or a
        sword, and at times we inquire about the need or suitability of the
        instruments, that is, how we ought to use them. It is the same in the
        other arts: sometimes we seek the means of doing a thing, sometimes we
        inquire how or why (these belong to the end just mentioned).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        479. Next [3], at “As has been previously stated,” he determines the
        limit or status of the deliberative inquiry. He does this under three
        headings. First [3, a] on the part of the agent himself. Hence he says,
        as has been previously stated (292), that man is the principle of his
        activity. Every individual takes counsel about the things which can be
        done by him. For this reason when he arrives, in the deliberative
        inquiry, at what he himself can achieve, at that point counsel ceases.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        480. Second [3, b], at “Actions are,” he shows that counsel has a limit
        or condition on the part of the end. All operations, he says, are
        performed for the sake of other things, that is, ends. Hence counsel is
        not taken about the end but about the means to the end. Evidently then
        there is a limit in deliberative inquiry (both on the part of the end
        and on the part of the agent) as in demonstrations (both from above and
        below) as it were on the part of either extreme.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        481. Third [3, c], at “We do not,” he shows the status of deliberative
        inquiry on the part of particular instruments which we use in our
        operations as available means for arriving at the end. He says that we
        do not deliberate about particular things, such as whether what is set
        before us is bread, whether it is properly prepared, i.e., baked or made
        as it should be. This belongs to sense perception.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        482. That the status of counsel-as also of demonstration-is according to
        these three considerations is proved by an argument leading to an
        impossible conclusion. If a man would always be taking counsel, he would
        be reaching to infinity, which does not fall under the consideration of
        the reason and consequently not under counsel, which is a kind of
        inquiry belonging to reason, as has been pointed out (476).

        Since the object of choice is one of the things considered by counsel as
        desirable and within our power, choice will be a desire (arising by
        reason of counsel) for the things which are in our power. When we have
        formed a judgment by taking counsel we desire a thing in accordance with
        our deliberation.

        Choice has now been defined according to type and in a general way and

        of what nature the things are with which choice deals and that choice is
        concerned with things which are ordered to end.

        483. After the Philosopher has considered counsel in itself, he now [B]
        treats counsel in comparison with choice. A twofold procedure clarifies
        this point. First [1] he compares counsel with choice. Second [2], at
        “Since the object of choice” [2], he concludes from this what choice is.
        In regard to the initial point he does two things. First [a] he
        introduces his proposition; second [b], at “What was previously judged
        etc.,” he proves it. First he compares counsel with choice in two ways.
        In one way relative to the object or matter of each where they are in
        agreement. Touching on this he says that an object of counsel and an
        object of choice are the same because both counsel and choice deal with
        things that act for an end. The other way is relative to the order of
        each. Touching on this he says that when something has already been
        decided by means of counsel then it is first chosen, counsel preceding
        choice as it were.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        484. Then [b], at “What was,” he explains what he has said, by a reason
        [b, i] taken from his previous observations (473-484) about counsel. The
        decision of counsel, he says, precedes choice because after the inquiry
        of counsel a judgment concerning the things discovered must follow. Then
        what was previously judged is first chosen. He shows clearly that the
        judgment of the reason should follow the investigation of counsel, by
        the fact that every individual who inquires by taking counsel how he
        ought to act ceases from deliberation when, by analysing his
        investigation, he is led to what he himself can do. If he can do several
        things, then, when he reduces them to the preceding, that is, to what he
        considers should be done first, this is what is chosen, namely, what
        presents itself to be done first. Hence it remains that choice
        presupposes the decision of counsel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        485. Second [b, ii], at “Our point is also brought out,” he proves his
        view by an example. That choice ought to follow the decision of counsel
        is brought out by the regal procedure of old, i.e., by the custom of
        ancient states according to which kings did not possess dictatorial
        power over the multitude so that they could do whatever they wished but
        were guides of the citizens to whom it belonged to choose the things
        decided by the kings in counsel. For that reason he says that the kings
        of old declared to the people the things they themselves had chosen by
        the decision of their counsel so that the people might choose what had
        been determined. Homer followed this by presenting the Greek rulers as
        proclaiming to the people what they had decided in counsel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        486. Next [2], at “Since the object,” he shows from the premises what
        choice is. He says that, since an object of choice is simply one of the
        number of the things within our power and which is considered by means
        of counsel, it follows that choice is only a desire (arising by reason
        of counsel) for things in our power. Choice is an act of the rational
        appetitive faculty called the will. On this account he said that choice
        is a deliberating desire inasmuch as, via counsel, a man arrives at a
        judgment regarding the things which were discovered by means of counsel.
        This desire is choice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        487. Last [2], at “Choice has now,” he shows of what nature this
        definition of choice is. He says that choice has now been defined by
        type, that is, in outline, and not as he customarily determines a thing
        through a full explanation, i.e., giving a definition and then
        investigating each element of it. But the definition of choice has been
        given in a general way. It has been stated (486) of what nature the
        things are with which choice deals, i.e., things in our power. Also it
        has been said that choice is concerned with things that are ordered to
        ends—about these, too, counsel treats.

        The virtuous person correctly passes judgment on each individual thing

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        488. After the Philosopher has finished the treatise on the voluntary
        and on choice, he here begins the study of willing [C]. He initiates his
        discussion by three stages. First [1] he takes notes of what is obvious
        about willing. Next [2], at “To some it seems etc.,” he raises a doubt.
        Last [3], at “If these conclusions etc.,” he solves the doubt. First he
        restates what he has previously insisted on (466) that willing is
        concerned with the end itself. He speaks here of willing
        (<i>voluntas</i>) as it denotes the act of the faculty of the will. The
        act of any faculty is named from the faculty itself and regards that to
        which the faculty primarily and of itself tends. Thus the act of the
        visive faculty is called vision in relation to visible things. In this
        manner understanding (<i>intellectus</i>) is named in relation to first
        principles that of themselves are referred primarily to the intellective
        faculty. Hence also willing is properly said to concern ends themselves
        which, as certain principles, the faculty of the will primarily and of
        itself regards.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        489. Then [2], at “To some it seems,” he raises a doubt. Regarding it he
        does three things. First [2, a] he sets forth contrary opinions about
        willing. He says that to some it seems that willing has for its object
        what is of itself good, but to others what is apparently good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        490. Next [2, b], at “For those who say,” he disproves the first opinion
        stating that for those who say that only the good in itself is the
        object of willing (i.e., to which the will tends), it follows that that
        thing which a person does not rightly will is not an object of willing.
        The reason is that, according to their opinion, it would follow that if
        something were an object of willing, it would be good, but it happens
        sometimes that it is evil. Therefore willing does not always have real
        good as its object.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        491. Last [2, c], at “On the other hand,” he disproves the second
        opinion, stating that for those who say the object of willing is
        apparent good, it follows that there is no natural object of willing but
        for each one the object of willing is what seems so to him. But for
        different men different and sometimes contrary things seem to be the
        object of willing. Thus if color were not visible but only what seemed
        to be color were visible, it would follow that nothing would be by
        nature visible. This, however, would not be fitting for every natural
        faculty has some object determined by its nature. Therefore it is not
        true that the object of willing is apparent good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        492. At “If these conclusions” [3], he solves the afore-mentioned doubt.
        First [3, a] he gives a solution according to a certain distinction. He
        says that if these disagreeable conclusions following from both these
        opinions are unacceptable, we must answer with a distinction that what
        seems good to a man is desirable either without qualification or under
        some aspect, i.e., in relation to this or that.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        493. Second [3, b], at “For the good man,” he shows with whom both parts
        of this distinction agree. He says that for the good man that thing is
        an object of willing which is truly worthy of being willed, i.e., good
        in itself. But for the wicked or vicious man that thing is the object of
        willing which attracts him, i.e., whatever seems pleasing to himself. He
        exemplifies this in things of the body. We see that for men whose bodies
        are in good health those things are healthful that are really so. But
        for the sick, certain other things are healthful, namely, those that
        moderate their diseased condition. Likewise things really bitter and
        sweet seem bitter and sweet to those who have a healthy taste, things
        really warm seem warm to those who have a normal sense of touch. Those
        who have normal bodily strength properly estimate the weight of objects;
        those who are weak think light objects heavy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        494. Third [3, c], at “The virtuous person,” he explains what he said,
        first 1c, i] as it affects virtuous men. He says that the virtuous
        person correctly passes judgment on individual things that pertain to
        human activity. In each case that which is really good seems to him to
        be good. This happens because things seem naturally pleasurable to each
        habit that are proper to it, that is, agree with it. Those things are
        agreeable to the habit of virtue that are in fact good because the habit
        of moral virtue is defined by what is in accord with right reason. Thus
        the things in accord with right reason, things of themselves good, seem
        good to it. Here the good man differs very much indeed from others, for
        he sees what is truly good in individual practicable matters, being as
        it were the norm and measure of all that is to be done because in these
        cases a thing must be judged good or bad according as it seems to him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        495. Next [c, ii], at “Many men,” he explains what he said as it affects
        vicious men. He says that for many, the vicious, deception in the
        distinction between good and evil occurs especially because of pleasure.
        As a consequence of this it happens that they desire as good the
        pleasurable, which is not good, and seek to avoid as evil what is for
        them painful but in itself good. The explanation is that they do not
        follow reason but the senses.

        Since willing regards the end but counsel and choice the means to the
        end, the actions concerning these means will be in accordance with
        choice and voluntary. But virtuous actions deal with the means. Virtue
        then is within our power.

        For a similar reason vice is voluntary. If it is in our power to act, it
        is also in our power not to act; and contrariwise. Therefore if to do
        good is in our power, then not to do evil will also be in our power. If
        not to do good is in our power, then to do evil will also be in our
        power.

        This view seems to be supported by the testimony of private individuals
        and of legislators themselves for legislators punish and chastise
        evildoers, unless these do evil by compulsion or on account of ignorance
        of which they themselves were not the cause. Likewise legislators decree
        honors for those who do good, thus encouraging them as it were but
        restraining the others. No one persuades a man to do whatever things are
        not in his power and not voluntary because before it takes place it is
        of no use to persuade a man not to become hot, or afflicted, or hungry,
        or anything whatsoever of this kind. We will suffer these things
        nonetheless.

        A man who is ignorant will be punished if he is the cause of his
        ignorance. A drunken man, for instance, is worthy of double punishment.
        The beginning is within him because he has it in his power not to get
        drunk. And his intoxication is the cause of his ignorance. Legislators
        punish those who are ignorant of things stated in the law that they
        should have known, but not those who are ignorant of the difficult
        things. Likewise in other cases we punish people whenever it seems that
        their ignorance was due to negligence because it is in their power not
        to be ignorant. They have it in their power to inform themselves.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        496. After the Philosopher has treated the voluntary, choice, counsel,
        and willing that are principles of human acts, he here applies what has
        been said to vices and virtues. Concerning this question he does three
        things. First [I] he determines the truth. Then [II], at “It is said
        that no one etc.,” he rejects an error. Last [Lect. 13; III], at “We
        have discussed virtues etc.” (B. 1114 b 26), he concludes with a summary
        of what has been said about virtue. On the first point he does three
        things. First [I, A], on the basis of his previous discussion, he shows
        that virtue is within us, i.e., in our power. Next [I, B], at “For a
        similar reason etc.,” he shows the same about vice. Last [I, C], at “If
        it is in our power etc.,” he shows the reason for this necessary
        consequence. He says first that since willing regards the end but
        counsel and choice the means to the end, it follows that actions
        concerning this (i.e., the means to the end) are in accordance with
        choice and are consequently voluntary. The reason is that choice is a
        voluntary as was indicated before (434-436, 457). But virtuous actions
        deal with the afore-mentioned (means) and are voluntary. Consequently,
        virtue itself must be voluntary and within us, that is, in our power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        497. Then [I, B], at “For a similar reason,” he shows the same thing
        about badness, i.e., about vice as opposed to virtue. He says that
        badness is likewise voluntary and within us because its operations are
        of this kind. He proves this in the following way: if the capacity to
        act is within us, the capacity not to act must also be in our power. If
        the capacity not to act were not in our power, it would be impossible
        that we would not act. Therefore, it would be necessary that we act, and
        so the capacity to act would not come from us but from necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        498. As a consequence we must conclude that wherever affirmation is
        within our power, negation is also; and conversely. Virtuous and vicious
        actions differ according to affirmation and negation. For instance, if
        honoring parents is good and an act of virtue, then not to honor one’s
        parents is evil and pertains to vice. If not to steal pertains to
        virtue, to steal pertains to vice. Hence it follows that if the
        operation of virtue is within us, as has been proved (496), then the
        operation of vice also is within us. So consequently vice itself is
        within us, that is, in our power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        499. Next [I, C], at “If it is,” he assigns the reason for this
        necessary inference: if the operations are within us, the habits too are
        within us. He says that if it is in our power to do or not to do good or
        evil actions, as has now been shown (497-498), while by reason of the
        fact that man works or does not work good or evil he becomes good or
        evil as was pointed out in the second book (250-253), it follows that it
        is within our power to be virtuous, i.e., good in conformity with the
        habit of virtue, and vicious in conformity with the habit of vice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        500. At “It is said” [II], he rejects an error about the afore-mentioned
        teaching. First [II, A] he removes the error itself. Second [Lect. 12;
        II, B], at “Perhaps such a person etc.” (B. 1114 a 3], he removes its
        roots. On the first point his division is threefold. First [A’] he
        explains his rejection of the error. Next [B’], at “Must we dispute even
        about what etc.,” he raises a doubt over this. Last [C’], at “If these
        things etc.,” he determines the truth. In regard to the first we must
        consider that some have held that no one is voluntarily evil, nor is
        anyone unwillingly happy or good. They say this because the will of
        itself tends to good. Good is what all desire and consequently the will
        of itself seeks to avoid evil. He says, therefore, that one of these
        statements is in all likelihood false, namely, that no one is willingly
        evil since vice is something voluntary. The other seems to be true, that
        no one is unwillingly good and happy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        501. Then [B’], at “Must we dispute,” he raises a doubt about things
        said before. If it is true that virtuous and vicious actions (and
        consequently virtue and vice) are voluntary, obviously what has
        presently been said is true. But is there anyone who believes there
        should be a doubt about what has been said, so that he might say that a
        man is not the principle and begetter of his actions as a father is the
        principle of his children? He as much as says: that anyone would say
        this, is to be wondered at.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        502. Next [C’], at “If these things,” he confirms the truth first [i] by
        reason; and then [2], at “This view seems etc.,” by signs. He says first
        that if counsel, choice, and willing—which are in our power—are seen as
        principles of our actions and we cannot reduce our actions to principles
        other than those that are in our power (i.e., counsel and choice) it
        follows that our good and bad actions are within our power. Because
        their principles are in our power, they themselves are in our power and
        hence are voluntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        503. At “This view seems” [2], he explains his proposition by means of
        signs: first [2, a] in the things that are clearly voluntary; and then
        [2, b], at “A man who is ignorant etc.,” in the things that seem to have
        something of the involuntary. He says first that the particular things
        that are done by individual private persons seem to bear witness to what
        has been said, i.e., that virtuous and vicious actions are within our
        power. Any father of a family punishes a child or a servant who does
        wrong. Likewise the things that are done by legislators, who care for
        the welfare of the state, bear witness. They give sometimes a light,
        other times a heavy sentence to criminals, provided however the
        wrongdoers do not act under coercion or through ignorance (of which they
        are not the cause); if they acted by compulsion or ignorance, their acts
        would not be voluntary, as is evident from what was said before
        (400-405). Hence it is clear that they were punished as acting
        voluntarily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        504. Likewise legislators decree honors for those who voluntarily do
        good: as it were encouraging the virtuous to good deeds by means of
        honors, and restraining the vicious from evil by means of punishments.
        No one encourages a man to do the things that are not in his power and
        not voluntary because in such matters encouragement before the act is
        entirely useless. It is useless, for instance, to urge a man in summer
        not to be hot, or in sickness not to be afflicted or not to be hungry
        when there is no food. or to do anything beyond his power. The reason is
        that he would suffer these things notwithstanding encouragement. If,
        therefore, we are not urged to do the things that are not within our
        power, but are urged to do good and avoid evil, such things are in our
        power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        505. Then [2, b], at “A man who is,” he manifests the same truth in
        those things which seem to have something of the involuntary. Ignorance
        causes an involuntary, as was explained before (4o6-424). If, however,
        we are the cause of the ignorance, the ignorance will be voluntary and
        we will be punished for it. A man can be the cause of his own ignorance
        in two ways. in one way directly, by doing something, as is evident in
        those who get drunk and for this reason are rendered ignorant. These
        should be doubly blamed. First because they drank too much, and next
        because they committed a sinful deed in their drunkenness. The principle
        of drunkenness is in the man himself because he has the power to remain
        sober and his drunkenness is the cause of his ignorance. Accordingly in
        this way a man is the cause of ignorance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        506. In the other way a man is the cause of ignorance indirectly by
        reason of the fact that he does not do what he ought to do. On account
        of this, ignorance of the things a man can and is bound to know is
        considered voluntary and therefore he is punished for it. This is why he
        says that legislators punish those who are ignorant of laws everyone
        ought to know (as that which forbids stealing), but not those who are
        ignorant of laws which are difficult to know and which not all are bound
        to know (because it is not possible). The same is true of those things
        which men do not know apparently by reason of negligence, because they
        could have learned. They are masters of themselves and they can be
        diligent and not negligent.

        sick does not become well in this way. So too it is with a man who
        voluntarily becomes sick by living immoderately and disregarding the
        doctor’s advice. Before, it was within his power not to become sick, but
        having placed the cause the effect is no longer within his power, just
        as one who throws a stone has not the power to take back the throwing.
        Nevertheless it is within a man’s power to cast or throw a stone because
        the original act was under his control. So it is also with the unjust
        and the incontinent who in the beginning had the power not to be come
        like this. For this reason they are voluntarily unjust and incontinent
        although after they have become such it is no longer within their power
        not to be such.

        Not only vices of the soul are voluntary but also defects of the body in
        certain men whom we justly reproach. No one reproaches those who are
        born ugly but only those who are so because of slothfulness and
        carelessness. The same is true with weakness, disgrace, and blindness.
        No one justly taunts a man who is blind from birth or disease or a wound
        but he is rather shown sympathy. But everyone does reproach a man blind
        because of excessive drinking of wine or other incontinence. Men are
        reproached for those vices and bodily defects that are within our power;
        but not for those beyond our control. This being so, in other things
        (pertaining to the soul) the vices we are blamed for must be within our
        power.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        507. After the Philosopher has rejected the error of those who hold that
        no one is voluntarily evil, he now [B] removes the roots of this error:
        first [A’] in regard to the internal disposition by reason of which
        (contrary to his own will) someone can tend to evil. Then [Lect. 13;
        B’], at “Someone may say” (B.1114 a 32), in the matter of the faculty of
        knowledge by which a thing is judged good or bad. He handles the first
        point in two steps. First [1] he proposes that which one can depend on
        in support of the preceding error. Then [2], at “But men make
        themselves,” he disproves this. The Philosopher has stated (506) that it
        is in the power of man to be diligent or negligent about something. But
        someone could deny this, saying that some person is naturally not
        diligent. Thus we see that men with phlegmatic temperaments are
        naturally lazy, men with choleric temperaments are naturally irascible,
        men with melancholic temperaments are naturally sad and men with
        sanguine temperaments are naturally joyful. According to this, it is not
        within man’s power to be diligent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        508. Then [2], at “But men make,” he rules out what was just said. To
        understand this we must consider that a man can be said to be of a
        particular bent in two ways. In one way according to bodily disposition
        following either the temperament of the body or the influence of the
        heavenly bodies. By reason of this disposition there can be no direct
        change of the intellect or will, which are faculties altogether
        incorporeal not using a bodily organ, as is made clear by the
        Philosopher in the third book <i>De Anima</i> (Ch. 4, 429 a 29-429 b 4;
        St. Th. Lect. 7, 687-699). But by this type of disposition some change
        can follow in the sensitive appetitive faculty, which does use a bodily
        organ, the movements of which are the passions of the soul. Accordingly,
        from such a disposition there is no more movement of the reason and will
        (which are principles of human acts) than is had from the passions of
        the soul, and concerning these it was likewise pointed out in the first
        book (241) that they are susceptible of persuasion by the reason. The
        other disposition is on the part of the soul. This is a habit by means
        of which the will or reason is inclined in operation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        509. On this account the Philosopher, having passed over the
        dispositions or qualities of the body, treats only the disposition of
        habits. On this point he does two things. First [2, a] he shows that
        habits of the soul according to which a man is negligent or unjust are
        voluntary from the fact that he is censured on account of them. Second
        [2, b], at “Not only vices of the soul etc.,” he indicates that even
        bodily defects which are blameworthy are voluntary. Regarding the first
        he does two things. First [a, i] he indicates that habits of the soul
        are voluntary with respect to their formation. Then [a, ii] he shows
        that they are not voluntary after their formation has already been
        completed. Touching on the first he does two things. First [i, x] he
        brings forward his proposition; and next [i, y], at “A man’s outlook
        etc.,” he proves it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        510. We must consider that evil habits differ as evil acts do. Some
        habits are evil from the fact that they withdraw a man from doing good.
        With respect to habits of this kind he says that men are the cause of
        their own evil lives for they are not diligent in doing good; they live
        carelessly without attempting good works. Other habits are evil because
        through them a man is inclined to do evil, whether this brings about the
        injury of others or one’s own disordered condition. With respect to
        these he says men by their own volition are the reason why they are
        unjust inasmuch as they do evil to others, and incontinent inasmuch as
        they live their lives in unnecessary drinking and in other things of
        this kind which pertain to the pleasures of touch.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        511. Next [i, y], at “A man’s outlook,” he proves the proposition first
        [y, aa] by means of a likeness in other things. We see that things done
        in individual actions make men of that particular stamp, i.e., disposed
        to do similar things. This is clearly manifest in the case of those who
        are diligent in and take pains with an exercise (like wrestling or
        soldiering) or any activity whatsoever. Everyone, from the fact that he
        does the action many times, becomes so adept that he can do similar
        things perfectly. Since then we see this happen in all cases, it seems
        that only a man lacking understanding would be ignorant that habits are
        produced by operations.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        512. Then [y, bb], at “Moreover, it is,” he shows the same thing by a
        reason taken from the relation of an act to a habit. If a man wills some
        cause from which he knows a particular effect results, it follows that
        he wills that effect. Although perhaps he does not intend that effect in
        itself, nevertheless he rather wishes that the effect exist than that
        the cause not exist. Thus if someone wishes to walk when it is hot,
        knowing beforehand he will work up a sweat, it follows that he wishes to
        perspire. Although he does not wish this in itself, nevertheless he
        wishes rather to perspire than to forego the walk. Nothing hinders a
        thing from being non-voluntary in itself, although it may be voluntary
        on account of something else, as a bitter potion taken for health. It
        would be otherwise if a man were ignorant that such an effect would
        follow from such a cause, e.g., a voluntary is not effected when a man
        who walks along the road falls among robbers because he did not know
        this beforehand. Obviously then men who do unjust actions become unjust
        and those committing seduction become incontinent. Therefore, it is
        unreasonable for a man to will to do unjust actions and nevertheless not
        intend to be unjust or to will to perpetrate seductions and not will to
        be incontinent. Thus obviously if a man who is aware of his action does
        voluntarily those things which make him unjust, he will be voluntarily
        unjust.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        513. At “Because a person becomes unjust” [a, ii], he shows that evil
        habits are not subject to the will after they have been formed. He says
        that because a person becomes unjust voluntarily, it does not follow
        that he ceases to be unjust and becomes just whenever he may will. He
        proves this by means of a likeness in the dispositions of the body. A
        man who in good health willingly falls into sickness by living
        incontinently i.e., by eating and drinking to excess and not following
        the doctor’s advice, had it in his power in the beginning not to become
        sick. But after he has performed the act, having eaten unnecessary or
        harmful food, it is no longer in his power not to be sick. Thus he who
        throws a stone is able not to throw it; however once he has thrown the
        stone he has not the power to take back the throwing. Nevertheless we do
        say that it is within a man’s power to cast or throw a stone because it
        was from a principle under his control. So it is also with the habits of
        vice; that a man not become unjust or incontinent arises from a
        principle under his control. Hence we say that men are voluntarily
        unjust and incontinent, although, after they have become such, it is no
        longer within their power to cease being unjust or incontinent
        immediately, but great effort and practice are required.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        514. Then [2, b], at “Not only,” he shows by means of a likeness to
        bodily defects that vicious habits are voluntary. He says that not only
        vices of the soul are voluntary but also defects of the body in certain
        men. Such men we justly reproach. No one reproaches those who are born
        ugly but only those who are ugly by reason of some negligence in proper
        care. The same is true with weaknesses and blindness. No one justly
        taunts a man who is blind from birth or disease or a wound which is not
        voluntary. But on account of those things sympathy rather is shown to
        the victim. Thus it is evident that we are reproached for those vices
        and bodily defects which are within our power. Hence obviously in other
        things, i.e., those things which pertain to the soul, the vices or
        vicious habits are in our power.

        If this is true how is virtue more voluntary than vice? For both alike,
        i.e., the good and the wicked, the end appears and is fixed by nature or
        howsoever it may be. In referring everything else to this end, men do
        whatever they do. Whether the end then, whatever it may be, does not so
        present itself by nature, but also depends on him, or whether the end is
        natural, and the good man using the means is voluntarily virtuous, in
        either case virtue as well as vice will be voluntary. For voluntariety
        exists in the evil man also since it influences him both in his actions
        and in his view of the end. If then, as is affirmed, virtues are
        voluntary (for indeed we ourselves are partly responsible for the way
        our habits dispose us and by living in a certain way we fix our end
        accordingly) it follows that vices also are voluntary because a similar

        We have discussed virtues in general and the outline of their genus. We
        have shown that each is a mean and a habit. We have explained that
        habits produce the same actions by which the habits themselves are
        caused. We have said that habits are in our power and voluntary, that
        they follow right reason and that voluntary operations are otherwise
        than habits because we have control over our operations from the
        beginning to the end when we know the particular circumstances. We are
        masters only of the beginning of our habits, but the individual steps by
        which they grow are not known to us, as in sicknesses. But because it
        was in our power to act or not to act in this way, the habits are called
        voluntary.

        Taking up again the consideration of virtues, we will discuss what each
        virtue is with what matter it deals and in what way it operates. At the
        same time we will clearly see also how many virtues there are. First we
        will treat the virtue of fortitude.

        95. After the Philosopher has overthrown the fundamental principle of
        those who hold that vice is not voluntary on the part of the disposition
        inclining the appetitive faculty, he here [B’] excludes another
        fundamental principle on the part of the cognoscitive power. On this
        point he does two things. First [1] he explains this fundamental
        principle; and second [2], at “Since, therefore, etc.,” he rejects it.
        In regard to the first we must consider that good precisely as it is
        perceived moves the desire. As the natural desire or inclination follows
        the form naturally inherent, so the animal desire follows the perceived
        form. In order then that a thing be desired,.it is first required that
        it be perceived as good. Hence everyone desires what appears good to
        him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        96. Therefore someone can say it is not in our power that this thing
        should seem or appear good to us. The reason is that we are not in
        command of our imagination, i.e., over the way things appear or seem to
        us. But in accord with the disposition of a man, so does his end seem to
        him, that is, such as a thing seems to a person, it must be desired as
        good and an end. A thing is agreeable to each according to its proper
        form: as fire tends upward, and things of earth tend to the center. So
        also we see that among the animals each one strives after something as
        good and an end according to its own natural disposition. Hence
        different animals have different activities and operations, although all
        animals of one species have similar movements and operations. But in the
        human species individuals are found having different movements and
        operations. Hence some were of the opinion that this arose from a
        natural disposition on account of which this thing seems good to one
        person and that to another in such a way that the procedure was not
        subject to a man’s control.

        517. Then [2], at “Since, therefore,” he excludes the afore-mentioned
        principle, and concerning it he does three things. First [a] he gives
        the reason repudiating these allegations (516). Next [b], at “Perhaps no
        one etc.,” he adds an answer which seems to counter this. Last [c], at
        “If this is true,” he disproves the counter-argument. On the first point
        we must consider that a thing can appear good to someone in two ways.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        518. In one way in general, it is so by a kind of speculative
        consideration. Such a judgment about good follows not any particular
        disposition but the universal power of reason syllogizing about actions,
        as it does in the case of natural things. Since practicable things are
        contingent, reason is not forced to assent to this or that as it does
        when demonstration occurs. But man has the power to give assent to one
        or the other part of a contradiction, as happens in all practicable
        things especially when we have under consideration many objects, any one
        of which can be judged good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        519. In the other way a thing can appear good to someone, as it were by
        a practical knowledge, by reason of a comparison with what is to be
        done. The Philosopher here speaks of this type of judgment that can be
        made in two ways about some good. In one way, a thing may appear good to
        someone absolutely and in itself. This seems to be a good in conformity
        with the nature of the end. In the other way, a thing may appear to
        someone not absolutely in itself but judged by present considerations.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        520. The appetitive faculty is inclined to an object on two accounts:
        one, by reason of a passion of the soul, the other by reason of habit.
        Under the impulse of passion it happens that a thing is judged good as
        it is at present. Thus to one who is afraid of drowning it appears good
        at the moment to throw his merchandise overboard; as does fornication to
        one filled with lust. But the judgment, by which a man accounts a thing
        good in itself and absolutely, arises from the inclination of habit.
        This we will discuss now. He, therefore, says that since a man in some
        measure is the. cause of his own evil habit by reason of his continual
        sinning—as has been pointed out (509-92)—it follows that he himself is
        also the cause of the imaginative reaction that follows such a habit,
        i.e., of the appearance by which this thing seems to be good in itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        521. Next [b], at “Perhaps no one,” he gives the counter-argument of the
        adversary against the point that has just been made (518-520). He says
        that perhaps someone will maintain that nobody is himself the cause of
        his own evil acts but each individual does evil because of ignorance of
        the end, inasmuch as he thinks that something very good is to follow
        from what he does wrongly. That a person desires a proper end does not
        arise from his own free will but must belong to him from birth. As from
        birth a man has external sight by which he correctly distinguishes
        colors, so also from birth he should have a well-disposed internal
        vision by which he may judge well and desire what is really good. Thus
        he must be said to be of good birth in whom the previously mentioned
        judgment has been implanted from birth. When a man innately has in good
        and perfect fashion what is greatest and best for him, this is a perfect
        and truly good birth. For man cannot gain this through the help or
        guidance of another; rather it is proper for him to possess it in the
        manner that nature has endowed him with it. Therefore, that a man should
        have this from birth renders his birth doubly praiseworthy: in one way
        through the excellence of the good, in the other because of the
        impossibility of otherwise acquiring it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        522. We must consider that this seems to be the opinion of certain
        mathematicians who hold that man is disposed at his birth by the power
        of the heavenly bodies to do this or that. This opinion is attributed by
        Aristotle in his work <i>De Anima</i> (Bk. III, Ch. 3, 426 a 21 sq.; St.
        Th. Lect. 4, 616-623) to those who did not hold the distinction between
        sense and intellect. If anyone should say, as in fact it is said in that
        place (ibid.), that the human will is impelled by the father of men and
        gods, i.e., the heavens or the sun, it will follow that the will (and
        the reason in which the will resides) is something corporeal as the
        senses are. It is not possible that what is in itself incorporeal should
        be moved by a body. Thus the will and intellect will contain a bodily
        organ and they will differ in no way from the senses and the sensitive
        appetitive faculty. Wherefore he draws a comparison between the sense of
        sight and intellectual vision by which we judge a thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        523. It must be said then that the heavenly bodies can cause in the
        human body a disposition inclining the sensitive appetitive faculty, the
        motion of which is a passion of the soul. Hence by reason of the
        influence of the heavenly bodies, a man does not have the inclination to
        judge that a thing is good absolutely and in itself (as through the
        habit of choice in virtue and vice) but to judge that a thing is good as
        it is at the moment, for example, in accordance with passion. The same
        observation must be made about the inclination that occurs from bodily
        temperament. In the present context, however, there is no question of a
        judgment by which we judge something good in accordance with passion,
        for the will is able to reject this—as was stated in (516)—but of a
        judgment by which we judge that something is good by means of habit.
        Therefore, this answer.,does not destroy the reason of Aristotle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        524. At “If this is” [c] he rejects this answer on the basis of the
        presuppositions of the adversary who took for granted that virtue is a
        voluntary but denied this of vice. Then returning to his earlier
        discussion (516)—which he had interrupted—he says that if this is true,
        namely, that the desire of the end exists in man by nature, there is no
        greater reason why virtue more than vice is voluntary. Reasoning in a
        similar fashion we say that, for both the virtuous and the vicious man,
        the goal must be innate no matter in what way it may seem to be
        perceived and actually desired. Although virtuous and vicious operation
        is concerned not only with the end but also with the means to the end,
        nevertheless men act by referring the remaining things (i.e., means to
        the end) to an end not from nature but howsoever it seems to them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        525. Therefore either it should be said that the end for every man does
        not seem to be such by nature but that it is relative to each man as it
        is in his power to cling to such or such an end, or even that the end is
        natural and by working on the means, man becomes voluntarily virtuous.
        Then virtue nonetheless will be voluntary. The same is true about vice
        because what is for the sake of the end in operations is attributable to
        the vicious man not less than to the virtuous, just as they are alike in
        regard to the end—as has been pointed out before (358-362). Therefore,
        if virtues are voluntary because of the fact that we are the causes of
        the habits by which we are disposed to fix an end of such a kind, it
        follows that vices also are voluntary because a similar reason holds for
        one as well as the other.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        526. Then [III], at “We have discussed,” he sums up in conclusion the
        material previously discussed (224525). First [A] he shows what has
        already been said about virtues, and then [B] what remains to be
        treated. He states first that virtues in general have been treated
        (<i>ibid.</i>) and their genus has been clearly manifested in type,
        i.e., according to their general characteristics. Then it has been said
        (324-331) what the mean is (this belongs to the proximate genus) and
        what the habits are (this belongs to the remote genus under which the
        vices are also contained). It has been affirmed also (255-279) that
        habits produce the same actions by which the habits themselves were
        caused. It has been stated too (496-525) that habits are in our power,
        that they follow right reason and that voluntary operations are
        otherwise than habits because we have control over operations from the
        beginning to the end, provided we know the particular circumstances.
        Although we do have control of habits from the beginning, afterwards,
        when we are inattentive, something is added in the generation of habits
        by means of particular operations. Thus it happens in sicknesses brought
        on by voluntary actions, as has been noted (513). But because it was in
        our power from the beginning to act or not to act in this way, the
        habits themselves are called voluntary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        527. Next [B], at “Taking up again,” he shows what remains to be
        treated. He says we must take up again the consideration of the virtues
        in order to determine what each virtue is, its subject matter, and its
        mode of operation. Thus we will clearly see also how many virtues there
        are. First we will treat the virtue of fortitude.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        528. After Aristotle has finished the treatise on virtues in general, he
        begins here a particularized study of the individual virtues. First he
        treats the virtues concerned with the interior passions. Next, he treats
        justice and injustice (concerned with external actions) in the fifth
        book (Lect. 1) at “We must give our attention to justice and injustice
        etc.” (B. 1129). The first section falls into two parts. In the first
        part [I] he treats the moral virtues dealing with the principal passions
        touching the very life of man. Next, he treats the moral virtues that
        are concerned with the secondary passions touching the external goods of
        man, in the fourth book (Lect. 1) at “Let us next discuss etc.” (1119 b
        21). Concerning the first part he does two things. First [A] he studies
        fortitude, which deals with the passions touching things destructive of
        human life. Then [Lect. 19] he studies temperance, which deals with the
        passions touching things preservative of human life, i e., food and sex,
        at “Following this treatise (on fortitude) we must etc.” (B.1117 b 22).
        On the first point he does three things. First [A’] he investigates the
        matter of fortitude. Next, “The same thing is not terrifying etc,”
        [Lect. 15], he treats the method of its operation (B. 1115 b 7). Last,
        at “Although fortitude is concerned etc.” [Lect. 18], he determines
        certain properties of the virtue (B.1117 a 29). In regard to the first
        he does two things. First [1] he reviews what was clearly evident from
        the premises about the matter of fortitude, i.e., with what passions it
        deals. Next [2], at “Terrifying things are what etc.,” he investigates
        the objects of these passions as fortitude is concerned with them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        529. He says, as has already been explained in the second book (267,
        341), that fortitude is a kind of mean dealing with fear and rashness.
        Fortitude denotes a firmness of soul by which it remains unmoved by the
        fear of dangers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        530. Then [2], at “Terrifying things,” he investigates the objects of
        the previously mentioned passions according as fortitude treats them,
        especially on the part of fear about which fortitude is principally
        concerned, as will be pointed out later (536). The objects of fear and
        rashness are identical, for what one man flees because of fear, another
        attacks in his rashness. On this point three considerations demand his
        attention. First [2, a] he shows what the objects of fear are. Next [2,
        b], at “But fortitude does not etc.,” he explains with what class of
        these objects fortitude deals, Since it is concerned with fear of death.
        Finally [2, c], at “It does not seem etc.,” he shows in particular what
        kind of death fortitude envisages.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        531. He says first that terrifying things are those we are afraid of,
        objects of fear, so to speak. All evil things are universally of this
        kind. Hence philosophers in giving a definition of fear say that it is
        the expectation of evil. Expectation is here taken generally for any
        movement of the appetitive faculty toward some future things, although
        expectation properly speaking is directed only to good, as is hope. It
        is evident then that we all fear some evils, like a bad reputation and
        disgrace (which are contrary to respectability), destitution and poverty
        (which are contrary to the goods of external fortune), sickness, enmity,
        and death (which are contrary to personal goods).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        532. Next [2, b], at “But fortitude does not,” he shows that fortitude
        deals with the fear of some particular evils. First [b, i] he shows
        about what evils it is not concerned. Second [b, ii], at “About what
        kind of terrifying things etc.,” he concludes about what evils it is
        concerned. on the first point he does two things. First [b, i, x] he
        sets forth his proposition that fortitude does not seem to deal with the
        fear of all evils.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        533. Second [b, i, y], at “For, to fear some things,” he proves his
        proposition, the first part of which is that fortitude does not deal
        with the fear of a bad reputation [b, i, y, aa]. The brave man is
        praised because he does not fear. But there are certain things which we
        ought to fear in order to live a good life. It is good to fear these
        things inasmuch as fear is not only necessary for the preservation of
        respectability, but even fear itself is something honorable. There is a
        kind of disgrace attached to the person who does not fear evils of this
        sort. This is obvious from the fact that one who fears a bad reputation
        is praised as decent, i.e., morally good and modest. But one who does
        not fear evil of this kind is blamed as shameless. It is evident,
        therefore, that fortitude is not concerned with fear of these evils.
        Sometimes, it is true, a man who does not fear a bad reputation is
        called by some brave, in a metaphorical sense, because he has a likeness
        to a brave man inasmuch as he is without fear.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        534. In the second part (of his proposition) at “Poverty is not to be
        feared” [b, i, y, bb], he shows that fortitude does not deal with the
        fear of poverty. He says that poverty is not to be feared in the way
        that a bad reputation is to be feared (533). Neither is sickness to be
        feared, nor indeed any of those things that do not pertain to wickedness
        of which man himself is the cause. It is useless for man to fear what he
        is unable to avoid. In regard to such things, therefore, a man ought to
        fear lest he fall into any of them by his own wickedness. The reason is
        that fear is useful to avoid these very things, but not otherwise.
        Although it is not necessary to fear things of this sort, nevertheless
        one who has no fear of them is not called brave except perhaps in a
        metaphorical sense. The reason is that not to fear poverty seems to
        belong to another virtue, liberality. Some are praised for the act of
        this virtue, inasmuch as they spend money freely. Yet they are called
        complete cowards in the greater dangers of war. Therefore, fortitude is
        not concerned with the fear of poverty.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        535. In the third part, at “No one is” [b, i, y, cc], he shows that
        fortitude does not deal with any fear whatsoever of personal evils. He
        says that a man is not called cowardly because he fears injury or envy
        of himself, his children or his wife, or any other thing of this kind. A
        person is not said to be brave because he does not fear the lash but
        boldly endures it, since these things are not especially terrifying. But
        a person is brave without qualification from the fact that he is brave
        in the face of the most terrifying dangers. One who is undaunted in some
        other circumstances is not called absolutely brave, but brave in that
        particular category.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        536. At “About what kind of” [b, ii] he shows that fortitude is
        concerned with the fear of certain evils, saying that man is called
        absolutely brave from the fact that he is fearless in the face of
        dangers which are most terrifying. Virtue is determined according to the
        maximum of the faculty, as is pointed out in the first book of
        <i>De Coelo</i> (Ch. II, 281 a 8; St. Th. Lect. 25, 249)Therefore, the
        virtue of fortitude must deal with the things that are most terrifying,
        so that no one endures greater dangers than the brave man. Among all
        dangers the most frightening is death. The reason is that death is the
        end of all present life, and after death there does not seem to be any
        good or evil equal to those things of this life that inflict death on
        us. Things belonging to the state of the soul after death are not
        visible to us, but that by which a man loses all his goods is
        appallingly frightening. Hence it seems that fortitude is properly
        concerned with fear of the dangers of death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        537. Then [2, c], at “It does not seem,” he shows that fortitude is
        concerned with the fear of a particular kind of death. On this point he
        does two things. First [c, i] he shows with what kind of death fortitude
        deals. Next [c, ii], at “A man is called brave etc.,” he explains the
        relation of fortitude to all the kinds of death. In regard to the first
        he does two things. First [c, i, x] he sets forth his proposition. Then
        [c, i, y I, at “Such men lose their lives etc.,” he proves his
        proposition. He says first that fortitude is not even concerned with
        death that a man suffers in some kind of accident or employment, as at
        sea or in sickness, but with death that he suffers from the best of
        causes, as happens when a man dies fighting in defense of his country.
        The same reason holds in the case of any other death that a person
        undergoes for the good of virtue. But he makes a special mention of
        death in battle because in that undertaking men more frequently suffer
        death for the sake of good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        538. Then [c, i, y], at “Such men lose,” he proves his proposition by
        two reasons. The first [c, i, y, aa] is that death in battle happens in
        the greatest danger since a man easily loses his life there. It happens
        also in the most noble of dangers since a man undergoes the danger in
        that case on account of the common good that is the greatest good, as
        has been noted in the beginning (30). But virtue is concerned with what
        is greatest and best. Therefore, the virtue of fortitude especially
        deals with death that takes place in battle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        539. Next [c, i, y, bb], at “Honors are given,” he proves the same thing
        from the fact that honors are given to those who die such a death or
        bravely expose themselves to the danger of a death of this kind. (This
        is the practice both in city-states that exist by association and in
        monarchies where kings alone rule.) The reason is that those who fight
        bravely in battle are honored both while they live and after death. But
        honor is the reward of virtue. Therefore, the virtue of fortitude is
        considered as dealing with death of this kind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        540. At “A man is called brave” [c, ii] he shows how fortitude has a
        relation to all the kinds of death. First [c, ii, x] he shows the way
        fortitude is related to the fear of death. Next [c, ii, y], at
        “Likewise, brave men etc.,” he shows its relation to boldness which is a
        reaction to dangers of this kind. On the first point he does two things.
        First [c, ii, x, aa] he explains the death about which fortitude is
        principally concerned. A man is called brave, he says, mainly because he
        is not afraid of death for a good cause, nor is he afraid of the
        threats—especially sudden threats—of death. The reason is that every
        virtue is ordered to good. Actions that must be done on the spur of the
        moment show in a special way that a person acts from habit. In other
        situations a man after careful deliberations can perform actions like
        those that proceed from the habit. Actions pertaining to good and the
        unexpected dangers in battle are especially of this kind. Hence the
        brave man who is not afraid is concerned principally with these actions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        541. Next [c, ii, x, bb], at “Moreover, brave men,” he shows how the
        brave man himself is without fear of other kinds of death. He says that
        as a consequence brave men are unafraid both in storms at sea and in
        sickness because they do not lose their heads and become upset because
        of fear of, such dangers. In storms, however, they differ from sailors.
        Even if the brave have no hope of rescue, they nevertheless despise
        death and are without fear. But sailors are unafraid of dangers from the
        sea by reason of their experience, for they have hope of being easily
        able to escape them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        542. Then [c, ii, y], at “Likewise, brave men,” he shows that fortitude
        is principally concerned not only with fear of death but also with
        boldness in dangers of this kind. He says that brave men likewise act
        manfully by meeting dangers in those circumstances where fortitude is
        praiseworthy and where it is noble to die, as in battle. It is good that
        a man endanger his life for the common welfare. But in the aforesaid
        modes of death, by shipwreck or by sickness, fortitude is not honorable
        nor does any good follow from death. Hence it does not belong to the
        virtue of fortitude to meet such dangers boldly.

        fore, fear such things, and he will undergo them as he ought, and as

        As has been pointed out, fortitude is a mean concerned with situations
        that inspire confidence or terror about which we have spoken; it desires
        or, endures things because it is good to do so, or because it is base
        not to do so. But to suffer death in order to avoid poverty or a
        disappointed love or something painful is not characteristic of a brave
        man but rather of a coward. It is a kind of effeminacy not to endure
        these misfortunes, and besides, such a one suffers a death not for an
        honorable good but to escape evil. Such then is the nature of fortitude.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        543. After the Philosopher has investigated the matter of fortitude, he
        now treats its act. First [I] he distinguishes the act of fortitude from
        the acts of the opposite vices. Next [Lect. 16; II], at “Other kinds of
        fortitude are enumerated etc.,” he treats certain things that have an
        act similar to fortitude (B.1116 a 16). He discusses the first point
        under two aspects. First [A] he determines how acts can be
        differentiated in the matter presently investigated. Then [B], at “One
        who endures etc.,” he shows what the proper act of fortitude is by
        comparison with the acts of the opposite vices. He handles the first
        point in a twofold manner. First [A, A’] he assigns the reason for
        differentiating acts in this matter. Second [A, B’], at “The brave man
        does not lose etc.,” he shows how they are differentiated. He observes
        first that the same thing is not terrifying to all.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        544. Since fear is in the irascible part-the object of which is the
        difficult-fear is concerned only with an evil which is in some way above
        the power of the one fearing. Hence a thing is terrifying to a child
        which is not terrifying to a mature man. There are evils that exceed
        human power to overcome, such as earthquakes, tidal waves, and other
        disasters of this sort. Hence evils of this kind are terrifying to every
        sensible man endowed with good judgment. But that terrifying thing which
        does not seem to exceed man’s power to resist may be viewed in a twofold
        way. One, according to the different magnitude of the thing, for
        example, it is more terrifying to have many enemies come together than
        to have only a few. The other, according to degree, for instance, that
        enemies have greater or less hatred, or that they are closer or farther
        away. What has been said about terrifying things must be said likewise
        about things inspiring courage because fear and boldness have the same
        object, as has been said previously (530).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        545. Then [A, B’], at “The brave man,” he shows by the reason just given
        how acts are differentiated in this matter. When it is affirmed that the
        brave man does not lose his head because of fear, this must be
        understood as referring to a man of sound judgment. Such a one will fear
        the things which are above man. Hence the brave man too will fear them.
        However, in case of necessity or utility, he will undergo such things as
        he ought and as right reason, which is proper to man, will judge. In
        this way he will not forsake the judgment of reason on account of the
        fear of such things, but will endure terrifying things of this kind, no
        matter how great, on account of the good which is the end of virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        546. It happens at times that a man fears terrifying things that are
        above his power, or within his power more or less than reason judges.
        What is more, it happens that he fears the things which are not
        terrifying as if they were terrifying. Man’s sin consists principally in
        what is contrary to right reason. As sickness takes p1ace in the body by
        reason of a disorder of some humor, so too sin against reason takes
        place in the soul by reason of a disorder of some circumstance. Hence
        sometimes a person sins in the matter of fear from the fact that he
        fears what he ought not to fear, but other times from the fact that he
        fears when he ought not to fear. The same must be said about the other
        circumstances enumerated above (544). What has been affirmed about
        terrifying things is to be understood about things inspiring boldness
        where a similar reason is found, as has been said (544).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        547. Next [B], at “One who,” he shows what the act of fortitude is by
        means of a comparison with the opposite vices. He treats this under two
        headings. First [1] he explains the act of the virtue and of the vices.
        Next [2], at “The reckless are etc.,” he compares the virtue with
        certain things that seem similar to it. He discusses the first point in
        a threefold manner. First [1, a] he defines the acts of the virtue and
        the vices relating to fear and rashness; and then [1, b], at “The coward
        is etc.,” those relating to hope and despair. Finally [1, c], at “The
        coward, the reckless etc.,” he concludes with a summary. He handles the
        first point from two aspects. First [a, i] he defines the act of the
        virtuous man; and then [a, ii], at “Of those who go etc.,” the acts of
        the vicious man. He considers the first point in a twofold way. First
        [i, x] he expounds his proposition. Next [i, y], at “The end etc.,” he
        makes clear something he had said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        548. He says first that one who endures the things he ought to endure
        and flees through fear the things he ought to avoid with the right
        motivation, in the right manner, and at the right time is called brave.
        Likewise, he who dares in the things he ought for the right motive and
        so forth is also brave. He assigns the reason for this when he says that
        a brave and virtuous man endures on account of fear and he acts by means
        of daring in conformity with what is fitting and as right reason
        indicates. Every moral virtue is in accord with right reason, as was
        stated previously (323, 326).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        549. At “The end” [i, y] he makes clear something he had said, namely,
        the right motive for operating. He remarks that the end of every
        virtuous operation is in conformity with the nature of its own habit. A
        habit caused by custom operates after the manner of a nature because
        custom is a kind of nature, as is noted in the book
        <i>De Memoria et Reminiscentia</i> (Ch. 2, 452 a 28; St. Th. Lect. 6,
        383). The ultimate end of an agent naturally operating is the good of
        the universe, a perfect good; but the proximate end is to imprint its
        likeness in another. Thus the end of a warm object is to make things
        warm by means of its activity. Likewise the ultimate end of operative
        virtue is happiness, a perfect good, as was said in the first book (45,
        111, 112, 117-118, 201, 222). But the proximate and proper end is to
        impress a likeness of the habit on the act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        550. This is what he means in his statement that the good, which the
        brave man intends, is fortitude—not the habit of fortitude, for this
        already exists, but the likeness of it in the act. This also is the end
        since every means is determined by its proper end because the character
        of means to the end is derived from the end. For this reason the end of
        fortitude is something pertaining to the nature of fortitude. In this
        way the brave man endures and works for the sake of good, that is,
        inasmuch as he intends to perform the actions which are in conformity
        with fortitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        551. Then [ii], at “Of those who go to excess,” he defines the acts of
        vicious men: first [ii, x] of the man deficient in fear; next [ii, y],
        of the man excessive in daring, at “He who is excessive in daring etc.”
        Last [ii, z], at “One who is excessive in fearing etc.,” he defines the
        acts of the man excessive in fearing. He says first that there is no
        special term for the man who abounds-speaking of the vices pertaining to
        excess in fearlessness, i.e. who fears nothing. It was said before (341)
        that many vices have no names. This particularly happens in things that
        rarely occur. And fearlessness of this sort rarely happens. It occurs
        only in the case of madmen and insensible persons who fear nothing—not
        even earthquakes, floods, or anything of this kind. This is said to
        happen among certain people called Celts (the name of a race). He speaks
        here of one who is insensible or without a sense of pain because the
        future things we fear and the things that cause us pain when present are
        the same.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        552. Next [ii, y], at “He who,” he treats those who are excessive in
        daring. He says that the man who, dealing with terrifying things,
        abounds in daring by boldly attacking them beyond what reason suggests
        is called reckless. But there is also one who is apparently but not
        really reckless, the vain man who pretends to be brave. Hence as the
        brave or reckless man really is in regard to terrifying things, so the
        vain man seeks to appear. Because of this the vain man imitates the
        works of the brave or reckless man when he can do so without danger.
        Hence many of those who seem brave or reckless are cowardly. Many of
        those who are reckless in circumstances having little danger do not
        endure when truly frightening things occur.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        553. At “One who” [ii, z], he treats of one who is excessive in fearing.
        The Philosopher says a man is a coward when he fears what he should not
        fear, in the way he should not fear, and so on. The man inordinate in
        fear is lacking in daring. The only reason why a person does not attack
        to destroy frightening things is fear. But the lack of fear can exist
        without the recklessness of attack. It does not follow then that
        everyone, who does not flee as he ought, attacks more than he ought. But
        whoever is deficient in attacking the right things is motivated only by
        fear. For this reason Aristotle separates the defect of fear from the
        excess of recklessness, but joins the excess of fear with the defect of
        recklessness. Although the coward is extreme in fearing and deficient in
        daring, nevertheless he is more conspicuous from the fact that he
        abounds in the fear of painful situations than from the fact that he is
        lacking in daring, because the defect is not so easily seen as the
        excess.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        554. Then [i, b], at “The coward is,” he shows, how the previously named
        things are related to hope and despair. For an understanding of this we
        must consider that the object of recklessness and fear is evil. But the
        object of hope and despair is good. The appetitive faculty of itself
        tends towards the good, but incidentally flees the good by reason of
        some evil attached. Likewise, the appetitive faculty of itself flees the
        evil. But what is essential causes that which is incidental. For this
        reason, hope—whose characteristic is to tend towards good—causes
        recklessness that tends towards the evil it attacks. For the same reason
        fear, which flees evil, is the cause of despair, which withdraws from
        good. He says, therefore, that the coward is a despairing man inasmuch
        as he fears his deficiency in everything. On the contrary the brave man
        has great hope because he is courageous.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        555. Next [i, c], at “The cowardly, the reckless,” he sums up what has
        been said, concluding from the premises that the cowardly, the reckless,
        and the brave man all are concerned with these passions but related to
        them in a different way. The reckless man exceeds in daring and is
        lacking in fear; the cowardly man exceeds in fear and is lacking in
        daring. But the brave man follows a middle course in these matters as he
        ought according to right reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        556. At “The reckless” [2] he compares fortitude with things similar to
        it. First [2, a] he shows the difference between the brave and the
        reckless man. Next [2, b], at “As has been pointed out etc.,” he shows
        the difference between the brave man and the man who undergoes death to
        escape misfortunes. The coward seems to have nothing in common with the
        brave man, and for this reason Aristotle does not care to assign the
        difference between them. He remarks that the reckless are impetuous,
        rushing into danger, i.e., swiftly and spiritedly going out to meet it,
        because they are moved by a surge of passion beyond reason. When they
        are actually in the danger they are checked, for the movement of the
        preceding passion is overcome by the threatening danger. But when the
        brave are in the very midst of the dangers, they are vigorous because
        the judgment according to which they act is not overcome by any danger.
        But before they meet the difficulties, they are calm because they do not
        act from violence of passion but from deliberate reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        557. Then [2, b], at “As has been pointed out,” he shows the difference
        between a brave man and the man who undergoes death to escape
        misfortune. He says, as has been noted (535-540), that fortitude is a
        mean in terrifying things, which are evils concerned with the dangers of
        death spoken of before (535-540); that fortitude tends to operate
        virtuously and sustains sufferings of this kind in order to bring about
        something good and honorable, or in order to flee something disgraceful
        and dishonorable. However, that one should die by laying hands on
        himself or by voluntarily suffering death inflicted by another (in order
        to escape poverty or a longing for a thing which he cannot possess or
        whatever else there is that causes sorrow) does not belong to a brave
        man but rather to a coward. This happens for two reasons. First, because
        a certain effeminacy of soul, contrary to fortitude, seems to exist when
        a person is unable to undergo hardships and sorrows. Second, because
        such a one does not suffer death for an honorable good, as the brave man
        does, but to escape a painful evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        558. Finally, he concludes that we can know, from what was said, the
        nature of fortitude.

        Other kinds of fortitude are enumerated according to five types. Among
        these, fortitude of the citizen holds first place, for it is most like
        real fortitude. Citizens apparently undergo dangers because of legal
        penalties and the disgrace of cowardice, and also for the sake of honor.
        For this reason men are found to be very brave in those states where the
        cowardly are censured and the brave accorded honors.

        This fortitude is most like that we just discussed as being exercised on
        account of virtue. It is indeed practiced on account of shame and the

        honor and the avoidance of the disgrace of opprobrium.

        Those who are under compulsion from their rulers will be included in the
        same type of fortitude. They are less worthy of the title, however,
        insofar as they do not act bravely because of shame but rather out of
        fear, for they flee not what is disgraceful, but what is painful.
        Masters coerce their subjects by threats as Hector did: “Anyone I find
        giving way to fear and not doing battle will not have a chance to escape

        Rulers do the same thing when they command their subjects not to give

        those who before battle construct walls, trenches, and other such

        In particular cases experience seems to be a kind of fortitude. For this
        reason Socrates thought that fortitude was knowledge. As others are
        brave in other things from experience, so soldiers are brave in warfare.
        In war there are many operations without danger which soldiers know very
        well. Those engaged in these exercises seem brave to others who are
        ignorant of the nature of such things. Hence professional soldiers are
        especially able by reason of experience to attack their adversaries
        without harm to themselves: skilled in the use of arms, they are able to
        guard themselves from blows and to strike back. They possess other
        skills like those that enable them to inflict injury while they
        themselves are not injured. They fight against others like the armed
        against the unarmed, like well-trained athletes against inexperienced
        rustics. In athletic contests of this kind it is not the brave who can
        fight the most but rather those who are physically powerful and
        well-conditioned.

        Soldiers turn cowards when they see that the danger exceeds their skill
        and that they are inferior in numbers and military preparations. They
        are the first to run away, while those possessing the fortitude of the
        citizen, refusing to leave, give up their lives. This actually happened
        in the battle at the temple of Hermes. Citizens think it disgraceful to
        flee, and choose to die rather than to be saved under such
        circumstances. But soldiers expose themselves to danger because from the
        beginning they think themselves more powerful. When the truth dawns on
        them they take flight fearing death more than disgrace. Not so the brave
        man.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        559. After the Philosopher has ascertained how the act of real fortitude
        and of the opposite vices is constituted, he treats here certain
        dispositions having an act similar to but lacking real fortitude (II).
        This happens in five ways. Since real fortitude is a moral virtue (for
        which knowledge is required and because of this, choice), a person
        exercising an act of fortitude can fall short of real virtue in three
        ways. In one way because he does not operate with knowledge. This is the
        fifth type of counterfeit fortitude, according to which a person is said
        to be brave through ignorance. In another way because a person does not
        operate by choice but by passion (whether it is a passion urging one to
        undergo dangers as anger does, or a passion quieting fear of the mind as
        hope does). According to this consideration, there are two kinds of
        counterfeit fortitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        560. The third way a person falls short of real fortitude is that he
        operates by choice, but he does not choose what the brave man chooses.
        In undergoing dangers he does not think it hazardous, because of his
        skill, to fight in battle, as is evident among soldiers; or he chooses
        to undergo the dangers not on account of the end that a brave man
        chooses but on account of honors or punishments decreed by rulers of
        states.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        561. Accordingly, this portion falls into five parts. In the first part
        [A] he treats civic fortitude or fortitude of the citizen; in the second
        [B], the fortitude of the soldier at “In particular cases etc.”; in the
        third part [Lect.17, C], fortitude that operates through anger, at
        “People confuse rage etc.” (B.1116 b 23); in the fourth part [Lect. 17,
        D], fortitude that operates through hope, at “Likewise the confident
        etc.” (B.1117 a ii); in the fifth part [Lect. 17, E], fortitude that
        operates through ignorance, at “Those who operate in ignorance etc.”
        (B.1117 a 23). In regard to the first he indicates three kinds of civic
        fortitude. The first kind [A, 1] belongs to those who undergo dangers
        for the sake of honor. The second [A, 2], to those who undergo dangers
        because of the fear of punishments, at “Those who are under compulsion
        etc.” The third [A, 3], at “Rulers do the same etc.,” to those who
        attack and expose themselves to dangerous situations because of pressing
        compulsion. He discusses the first point under three headings.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        562. First [i, a] he brings out this kind of fortitude. He says that
        over and above real fortitude, certain other kinds of fortitude are
        enumerated according to five types. Among these, civic fortitude or
        fortitude of the citizen holds first place because this type is very
        similar to real fortitude. Citizens undergo dangers to avoid penalties
        and disgrace which, according to the civil laws, are inflicted on the
        cowardly, and to acquire honors which by the same laws are bestowed on
        the brave. So in those states where blame is heaped on the cowardly and
        honors on the brave, men are found most brave according to this type of
        fortitude, and perhaps even according to the real virtue by reason of
        habit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        563. Second [i, b], at “Homer mentions,” he gives examples taken from
        Homer who, describing the Trojan War, introduces men brave for honor or
        fear of blame: Diomede among the Greeks and Hector for the Trojan side.
        He represents Hector as saying these words: “Polydamas, the Trojan
        leader, will be the first to reproach me (i.e., he will find fault first
        of all with me) if I do not fight manfully.” And Diomede exhorting
        himself to act bravely said: “Hector haranguing the Trojans will say in
        praise of himself and in vituperation of me that Tydides (a name given
        him from his father’s), alias Diomede, has fled from me and has been
        beaten.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        564. Third [i, c], at “This fortitude,” he clarifies what he has said:
        that this kind of fortitude is very similar to the genuine virtue. He
        says that the citizen’s fortitude is much like the one of which we have
        spoken (562), since it is for the sake of virtue. This fortitude of the
        citizen is practiced through shame or fear of the disgraceful, inasmuch
        as someone flees disgrace, and through a desire of the good or honorable
        insofar as this fortitude seeks honor, which is the testimony of
        goodness. For this reason he adds in explanation that fortitude of this
        sort is motivated by honor and avoidance of opprobrium, which is the
        disgraceful. Since then honor is a thing near to an honorable good, and
        blame to the disgraceful, it follows that this fortitude is close to
        real fortitude, which seeks what is honorable and flees from what is
        shameful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        565. Then [A, 2], at “Those who,” he indicates the second kind of civic
        fortitude that is practiced on account of punishment. He says that those
        who are brave, because compelled by the fear of punishments inflicted by
        rulers of the state, can be assigned the same type of civic fortitude.
        They are, however, inferior to the previously mentioned insofar as they
        do not act bravely on account of the shame of disgrace but on account of
        fear of punishment. This is why he adds that they do not flee what is
        disgraceful or dishonorable but what is sorrowful, i.e., painful or
        injurious, from the fact that someone is made sad. In this way the
        masters compel their subjects to fight bravely. According to Homer,
        Hector threatened the Trojans in these words: “Anyone running away and
        not doing battle, i.e., without fighting bravely, I will handle so
        roughly that he will not have a chance to escape the dogs.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        566. Next [A, 3], at “Rulers do the same,” he presents the third kind of
        civic fortitude according as some are compelled by their rulers then and
        there and not only by fear of future punishment. This is why he says
        that rulers do the same thing by their actions when they command their
        subjects not to run away from battle, and beat those who do. A similar
        judgment is to be passed on those who, before battle, construct walls
        and trenches and other such obstacles to retreat so that their subjects
        cannot take to flight. All rulers who do things of this kind coerce
        their subjects to fight. And those who act under compulsion in this way
        are not really brave, because the virtuous man must be brave not on
        account of the constraint he suffers but because of the good of virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        567. At “In particular cases” [B] he treats the fortitude of the
        soldier. He explains this question in a twofold manner. First [B, 1] he
        shows what leads soldiers to fight bravely. Next [B, 2] he compares the
        fortitude of the soldier and the citizen, at “Soldiers turn cowards.” He
        says first that in individual cases experience seems to be a kind of
        fortitude. In any undertaking one who has knowledge from experience
        works boldly and without fear, as Vegetius says in his book on military
        affairs: “No one fears to do what he believes he has learned to do
        well.” For this reason Socrates thought fortitude was knowledge which is
        acquired by experience. He even thought all the virtues are kinds of
        knowledge. But this question will be studied later in the sixth book
        (1286). Therefore, since certain others are brave by experience in
        particular affairs, so soldiers are brave in warfare by reason of
        experience.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        568. Two things follow from this. The first is that in war there are
        many great things like the clash of arms, the charge of the cavalry, and
        so on that strike the inexperienced with terror, although there is
        little or no danger in them. These things, as the professional soldiers
        know, are not really to be dreaded. Hence men seem brave when engaging,
        without fear, in exercises that appear dangerous to others who are
        inexperienced and ignorant of the nature of what is taking place.
        Second, it follows that by reason of experience professional soldiers in
        fighting can do hurt to their adversaries, and not suffer or be harmed
        in turn. They can guard themselves from blows and can strike back, for
        they are clever in the use of weapons, and they possess other skills
        effective in enabling them to inflict injury while they themselves are
        not injured. Hence it is obvious they fight against others as the armed
        against the unarmed. A man is in effect unarmed if he does not know how
        or is unable to use arms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        569. The same can be said of athletes, i.e., strong and well-trained
        boxers compared to simple and inexperienced farm boys. In such athletic
        contests it is not the brave who can fight the most but those who are:
        physically powerful and well- conditioned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        570. Then [B, 2] at “Soldiers turn,” he compares the fortitude of the
        soldier and the citizen. He says that soldiers fight bravely so long as
        they do not see danger threatening. But when the danger exceeds the
        skill they have in arms and when they lack numbers and adequate military
        preparations, they become cowardly. Then they are the first to run away;
        they were daring for no other reason than that they thought the danger
        was not imminent. Therefore, when they first see the danger, they take
        to their heels. But those who possess the fortitude of the
        citizen—refusing to leave the danger—lose their lives, as happened in a
        certain place where the citizens remained after the soldiers had fled.
        The reason is that citizens think it disgraceful to run away, and choose
        to die rather than save themselves by flight. But soldiers expose
        themselves to dangers because, from the beginning, they think themselves
        more powerful. But after they have recognized that the enemy is more
        powerful, they take to flight fearing death more than ignominious
        escape. It is not so with the brave man who fears disgrace more than
        death.

        People confuse rage or wrath with fortitude. Indeed the enraged appear
        brave in the way that wild animals turn on those who have wounded them.
        The brave man does give the appearance of rage which acts most
        impetuously against danger. Hence Homer warns: “Put strength into thy
        wrath” [Iliad xiv. 151], and “arouse thy might and wrath” [Iliad v.
        470]; and (in reference to a certain man) “he panted harsh courage
        through both nostrils” [Odyssey xxiv. 318], and “his blood boiled”
        [Theocritus xx. 15]. All such expressions seem to signify the stirring
        up and the impulse of rage.

        Wild animals attack danger because of pain from a wound or from fear;
        undisturbed in the woods and swamps they do not come out to attack. They
        are not truly brave because, aroused against danger by pain and rage,
        they do not foresee the risks involved. Otherwise hungry jackasses would
        be brave since they do not stop eating when beaten. (Adulterers too

        Those who operate in ignorance of dangers seem to be brave. They do not
        differ greatly from people who are brave by reason of great hope. They
        are, however, inferior since they have no self-reliance unlike the
        confident who remain in the fight for some time. Those who are bold
        through ignorance take flight as soon as they know the situation is
        different from what they suspect. This happened to the Argives when they
        fell on the Spartans whom they thought Sicyonians [Xenophon,
        <i>Hellenica</i>, iv. 4, 10]. We have now discussed both the brave and
        those thought to be brave.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        571. After having disposed of two types of counterfeit fortitude, he
        proposes here [C] to treat a third kind operating by means of rage which
        urges to the act of fortitude. He treats this point in a twofold manner.
        First [C’ 1] he shows how rage inclines to the act of fortitude. Next
        [C, 2], at “The brave are etc.,” he shows how this fortitude differs
        from real fortitude. He observes first that men in common usage of
        speech confuse rage with fortitude when they attribute to fortitude
        things that enraged or angry people do. Indeed the enraged and angry do
        seem to be brave. So too do beasts who, when aroused to rage, attack men
        beating them. Fortitude has some likeness to rage inasmuch as rage
        incites against danger with a very strong impulse. But the brave strives
        against danger with strength of soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        572. As an example he quotes the verses of Homer who warned someone in
        these words: “Put strength into your wrath” so that wrath may be
        directed by the virtue of the soul; “Arouse your might and wrath” that
        the virtue of your soul may be rendered more prompt by anger. Elsewhere
        he remarks that certain people “pant harsh courage through both
        nostrils;” in other words, wrath, because of the beating of the heart,
        makes breathing so heavy that sometimes “the blood boils up” through the
        nostrils from the force of rage. And the Philosopher observes that
        Homer’s statements here seem to indicate that anger is aroused and gives
        impetus to fortitude’s act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        573. Then [C, 2], at “The brave,” he explains the difference between
        this and genuine fortitude. He discusses this point from three aspects.
        First [2, a] he shows what pertains to true fortitude; next [2, b], at
        “Wild animals attack etc.,” what pertains to the rage of beasts; and
        finally [2, c], at “Angry men,” what pertains to human rage. He says
        that the brave are not incited to perform works of fortitude by the
        impulse of rage but by the intention of good. Rage, however, does
        operate secondarily in these acts in the manner of a co-operator.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        574. Next [2, b], at “Wild animals,” he shows how the anger of beasts
        compares with the act of fortitude. He remarks that wild animals attack
        dangers out of pain from harmful things—which they are actually
        suffering when wounded, for instance—or because of the dread of the
        things they fear they are about to suffer, e.g., when incited to anger
        by fear of being wounded, they attack men. The reason is that if they
        were in the woods or swamps they would not be wounded nor fear to be
        wounded, so would not come out to attack men. Hence it is clear that
        real fortitude is not found in these animals because they are aroused
        against the dangers only by pain and rage, since they do not foresee
        dangers, as those who act bravely by choice. If beasts who act by
        passion were brave, then by the same argument hungry jackasses (who,
        because of the desire for food do not stop eating even when beaten)
        would be brave. Adulterers too undertake many risks for the sake of
        lust, but real fortitude is not found in them because they do not act by
        choice of good, but by reason of passion. So it is clear that animals
        who are incited against danger on account of pain do not have true
        fortitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        575. However much is the likeness between desire and rage, nevertheless
        among all the passions fortitude out of rage seems to be more connatural
        to genuine fortitude, so that if rage be antecedently directed by choice
        and the motivation of a fitting end, real fortitude will be present. He
        expressly says “antecedently directed” because in true fortitude rage
        ought to follow rather than precede choice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        576. At “Angry men” [2, c] he shows what belongs to fortitude that
        operates by the anger of men who seem to act by choice and to intend
        some purpose—the punishment of the person with whom they are angry. For
        this reason he says that angry men are grieved over an injury received
        and as yet unavenged. But when they are taking vengeance they are
        delighted in the satisfaction of their desire. Those who work vigorously
        at this may perhaps be called pugnacious but hardly brave because they
        are not doing the right thing, nor are they led by reason but rather by
        passion for the sake of which they desire vengeance. However, they do
        possess something similar to genuine fortitude as is evident from the
        premises (571-572).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        577. Then [D], at “Likewise the confident ‘ “ he mentions a fourth kind
        of fortitude according to which some are called brave by reason of hope.
        He develops this idea in a threefold fashion. First [D, i] he explains
        this type of fortitude. Next [D, 2], he compares this type with true
        fortitude at “However, such confident people etc.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Finally [D, 3], he deduces a corollary from what has been said, at
        “Therefore, that man etc.” He says first that, as those who act bravely
        on account of anger are not truly brave, so neither are they who act
        bravely for the sole reason of their hope for victory. But they have a
        certain preeminence by which they differ from others. From the fact that
        they have very often conquered in the midst of danger, they are now
        confident of obtaining victory not by reason of any skill acquired
        through experience—this belongs to the second type of fortitude—but
        solely by reason of a confidence derived from their frequent victories
        in the past.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        578. Next [D, 2], at “However, such confident people,” he compares this
        fortitude to real fortitude. He notes that those who have abundant
        confidence in this manner are like the truly brave because both are
        daring-resolute in meeting dangers-but not in the way that a reckless
        person is at fault. They differ however since the brave boldly attack in
        the fashion already indicated, i.e., by choice and on account of good.
        But those who have high hopes attack boldly because they think
        themselves more able fighters and are not going to suffer any reverse
        from others. They resemble drunkards who also become confident when
        their spirits are reinforced by wine. But when such persons fail to get
        what they expect, they do not persist; they run away. It is a mark of
        the brave man, however, to suffer—for the sake of what is honorable and
        to avoid disgrace—evils that are terrifying to men, real evils and not
        merely apparent ones.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        579. At “Therefore, that man” [D, 3] he deduces a corollary from what
        has been said. Because the brave man characteristically endures
        terrifying things according to the inclination of a proper habit, that
        person seems to be braver who is not more afraid or disturbed by
        unexpected terrors than by those which were apparent beforehand. Such a
        one seems to act more from habit inasmuch as he apparently has had less
        opportunity to prepare himself to endure these evils. A man can choose
        by reason and deliberation (even contrary to the inclination of habit
        and passion) the things that are foreseen. In no case is the inclination
        of habit or passion so vehement that reason is unable to resist provided
        that the use of reason—which of itself has a relation to
        contraries—remains with man. But in unexpected events a man, cannot
        deliberate. Hence he seems to; operate by an interior inclination
        according to habit.
      </p>

        580. Then [E], at “Those who operate,” he introduces the fifth kind of
        counterfeit fortitude. He says that those who are ignorant of dangers
        seem to be brave when they resolutely attack things equally dangerous,
        but which do not seem so dangerous to them. They do not differ much from
        people who are brave by reason of great confidence. Each thinks that
        dangers do not threaten him.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        581. They differ, however, in that the ignorant do not consider the
        evils they attack to be dangers in themselves and without qualification.
        On the other hand those who have high hopes know the nature of the evils
        they assail but do not think that these constitute dangers for them.
        Those who are ignorant are the more inferior to those who have high
        hopes inasmuch as the ignorant have no self-reliance at all, but go out
        to meet dangers only because of the lack of knowledge. But those who
        have great hopes remain for some time—even after they recognize the
        dangers—until the greatness of the danger overwhelms their hope. Those
        who are brave through ignorance, however, take flight as soon as they
        know the situation is different from what they suspected. The Argives,
        Greek citizens, reacted in this way when thinking they were fighting
        against Sicyonians—citizens weaker than themselves—they in fact fell
        upon other stronger soldiers.

        brave inasmuch as they are considered brave by a similitude and not
        because they are truly brave.

        Still the brave man seems to take b pleasure in attaining the end for
        the sake of fortitude but this pleasure vanishes on account of the
        accompanying discomforts, as we see happen in athletic contests. Boxers
        take pleasure in the end they strive for, the laurel wreath and the
        honors. But being flesh and blood they suffer pain from blows, and all
        the labor they undergo is disagreeable. Because these distressing things
        are many and the end insignificant, they do not seem to feel any
        pleasure. Such also is it with the act of fortitude, for death and
        wounds are painful to the brave man who endures them to attain the good
        of virtue and to avoid disgrace.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        583. After the Philosopher has treated the matter and the act of
        fortitude, he considers here certain properties according as it is
        related to pleasure and pain. On this point he does two things. First
        [1] he details the properties of fortitude. Then [2] he excludes them
        from fortitude of the soldier, at “Nothing hinders etc.” He develops the
        first consideration in three ways. First [a] he shows how fortitude is
        related to fear and daring; next [b], how fortitude is related to pain,
        at “As has been said etc.”; last [c], how fortitude is related to
        pleasure, at “Still the brave man seems etc.” He says first that
        although fortitude is concerned with both daring and fear, it is not
        concerned with each in the same manner. But praise of this virtue
        consists rather in this, that a person behaves well with respect to
        terrifying things. One who is not disturbed by frightening evils but
        conducts himself as he ought in regard to them is more commended for
        bravery than one who conducts himself well in regard to daring. The
        reason is that fear is a threat to a man from someone stronger rising up
        against him. But daring originates from the fact that a man thinks that
        the one he attacks is not too powerful to overcome. It is more difficult
        to stand against a stronger man than to rise up against an equal or
        weaker one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        584. Then [b], at “As has been said,” he shows in what manner fortitude
        is concerned with pain. To understand this we must consider that the
        object of fear and pain is the same, evil. But they differ according to
        past and future. Future evil is something terrifying while evil
        threatening in the present is something afflicting. It pertains to the
        brave man not only to stand against the fear of future dangers but also
        to continue steadfastly in the midst of these very dangers, as was noted
        previously (548). For this reason he says that men are called brave
        particularly because they stout-heartedly endure distressing things,
        i.e., immediately threatening things like blows and wounds. So it is
        that fortitude has pain connected with it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        585. Consequently, fortitude is justly praised because it does not
        withdraw from the good of virtue to escape pain. On this account it is
        reasonable that fortitude is most praiseworthy, since the praise of
        virtue consists especially in the fact that a person deals courageously
        with troublesome matters. It is more difficult to endure distressing
        things (which pertains to fortitude) than to abstain from pleasurable
        things (which pertains to temperance). Therefore fortitude is more
        praiseworthy than temperance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        586. Next [c], at “Still the brave man, ‘ he shows in what manner
        fortitude is related to pleasure. He discusses this point from three
        aspects. First [i] he submits his proposition. Next [ii], he rejects an
        error, at “As a man is more perfect etc.” Last [iii], he deduces a
        corollary from what has been said, at “The pleasurable operation etc.”
        He says first that since fortitude consists in enduring distressing
        things, the brave man seems to take some pleasure in attaining the end
        for which he bravely struggles. But this pleasure is vapid, i.e., feebly
        felt on account of the accompanying griefs, as happens in athletic
        contests in which boxers fight with no protection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        587. Boxers take pleasure in the end they strive for, i.e., that they
        may receive the crown and be honored. But to take a beating is painful
        to them. To deny this is to deny that they have flesh and blood, because
        if they have sensitive flesh, hurtful things must cause them pain.
        Likewise, all the drudgery they suffer in fighting is disagreeable to
        them. Since there are many disagreeable and painful experiences they
        undergo, and since the good they possess as an end is something
        insignificant, they do not seem to be sensible of any pleasure because
        the pleasure is absorbed by the stronger pain. So it occurs too in the
        act of fortitude, for death and wounds are painful to the brave man,
        although he endures them to attain the good of virtue and to avoid
        disgrace—an end more important than that of boxers. Hence some pleasure
        abides rather by reason of the end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        588. At “As a man is more” [ii] he rejects the error of the Stoics who
        held that virtuous men feel no pain. He considers this point in a
        twofold manner. First [x] he proves that very intense pain befalls the
        brave man; and next y I that, because of this, his fortitude is not
        lessened but increased, at “This is saddening etc.” He argues in the
        first part from what the Stoics took for granted, that there was no
        human good except virtue. Therefore, they said that the virtuous man is
        not subject to grief because, by reason of his own good, he suffers no
        harm. On the contrary, the Philosopher says that as a man is more
        perfect in virtue and happier according to the happiness of the present
        life, so much more he is saddened (according to the consideration of the
        goods of this life) by the imminence of death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        589. A man’s sadness at the loss of any good can be increased by two
        circumstances. First if the loss is of a deserved good, and second if
        the loss is of something great. Both things are present in our case
        because the virtuous man most of all deserves to live. Likewise he is
        knowingly deprived of the most excellent good, i.e., the best life and
        the virtues which he loses so far as the use in the present life is
        concerned. This causes him distress, even granted that sorrow does not
        befall him in respect of any other evils whatsoever that are suffered
        without the loss of life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        590. We must consider, however’ that to some virtuous men death is
        desirable on account of the hope of a future life. But the Stoics did
        not discuss this, nor did it pertain to the Philosopher in this work to
        speak of those things that belong to the condition of another life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        591. Then [y], at “This is saddening,” he says that this sorrow, of
        which we were speaking, does not lessen fortitude. Rather someone is
        said to be brave from the fact that he chooses the good of
        fortitude—which is sought in battle—in preference to those goods that he
        loses by death, desiring more to do one great good than to preserve many
        lesser goods, as will be explained later in the ninth book of this work
        (1879-1880).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        592. Next [iii], at “The pleasurable operation,” he concludes from the
        premises that, although it was stated in the first and second books
        (154-160, 267, 275-279) that virtuous operations are pleasurable, the
        pleasurable operation is not found in all virtues, except as it attains
        to the end. This is noted on account of fortitude, as is evident from
        what was just said (586-587).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        593. At “Nothing hinders” [2] he excludes the previously mentioned
        properties from the fortitude of the soldier. He says that nothing
        hinders some men from being very good soldiers, who are not such as we
        have described the brave man to be. But perhaps those who are less brave
        and attend to no other good, not even the good of fortitude, are better
        soldiers. They are prepared for danger not by reason of any good of
        virtue, but in a measure they barter their life, which they expose to
        risk, for trifling gains of money and booty for instance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        594. Then [3], at “So much then,” he sums up in conclusion what has been
        said. He states that the definition of fortitude can be understood
        according to its general outlines, so that we may say that it is a
        virtue consisting in a mean according to right reason dealing with fear
        and daring on account of the good.

        Temperance is a mean dealing with pleasures, as we have said before. It
        is less concerned, and not in the same way, with sorrows. Intemperance

        The same is to be said in respect to those who take pleasures, except
        incidentally, in odors. We do not call intemperate people who delight in
        the fragrance of apples or roses or incense, but rather those who take
        pleasure in the perfume of cosmetics or the aroma of tasty dishes. The
        intemperate enjoy these pleasures because in this way things they desire
        are recalled. One may see others too taking delight in the aroma of food
        when hungry. But it pertains to the intemperate man to rejoice in this
        aroma as representing what is desirable.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        595. After the Philosopher has treated fortitude concerned with
        terrifying things which are destructive of man’s life, he now takes up
        the question of temperance concerned with pleasurable things which
        preserve human life, i.e., food and sex. On this point he does two
        things. First [I] he indicates what he intends to do. Next [II] he
        carries out his intention, at “Temperance is a mean etc.” He says first
        that, after the treatise on fortitude, we must speak about temperance.
        He finds the reason for this succession in the fact that these two
        virtues agree in subject. Both pertain to the irrational part, according
        as that part of the soul is called irrational which is designed by
        nature both to conform to, and to obey reason, as was stated in the
        beginning (239). Such is the sensitive appetite to which the passions of
        the soul belong.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        596. Hence all the virtues dealing with the passions must be placed in
        the sensitive appetite. Fortitude is concerned with the passions of fear
        and daring, which reside in the irascible part, but temperance is
        concerned with pleasures and pains, which reside in the concupiscible
        part. Consequently, fortitude is placed in the irascible part, but
        temperance in the concupiscible Part.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        597. We must consider that the pleasures of food and sex, with which
        temperance deals, are common to us and the brutes. Likewise, the fear of
        death, with which fortitude is concerned, is common to us and them. For
        this reason he notes particularly that these two virtues are of the
        irrational parts, because they belong to the irrational parts of the
        soul not only on account of the passions themselves but also because of
        the objects of the passions. There are some passions whose objects do
        not concern the brutes, like riches, honors and so on.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        598. Then [II], at “Temperance is a mean,” he begins to define
        temperance. First [A] he inquires what the matter of temperance is.
        Second [Lect. 20, B], at “Some desires are,” he defines the act of
        temperance and of the opposite vices (B.1118 b 8). He considers the
        first point under two aspects.Tirst [A’] he proposes the matter of
        temperance in general. Next [B’], at “We must now determine etc.,” he
        inquires about its special matter. In regard to the first point he
        reviews three considerations which were discussed in the second book
        (342). The first is that temperance keeps a mean concerning pleasures.
        The second is that temperance deals also with sorrows that arise from
        the absence of pleasures. Temperance is less concerned, however, with
        sorrows than with pleasures because a thing acts more efficaciously by
        its presence than by its absence. The third is that intemperanct
        likewise deals with pleasures and sorrows because contraries are
        concerned about the same thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        599. Next [B’], at “We must now determine,” he inquires about the
        special matter of temperance. Three aspects claim his attention. First
        [1] he says what he intends to do. Then [2], at “There are,” he
        distinguishes the kinds of pleasures. Last [3], at “Men are not called
        etc.,” he shows with what kind of pleasures temperance deals. He says
        first that, since temperance deals with pleasures, we must now determine
        with what kind of pleasures it deals, so that the nature of temperance
        in particular may be known.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        600. At “There are” [2] he distinguishes the kinds of pleasure. He says
        that some of them are of the soul, others of the body. Pleasures of the
        body are those that are completed in some bodily affection of an
        external sense. Pleasures of the soul are those that are completed by
        interior apprehension alone. He gives an example of pleasures of the
        soul, beginning with the cause of pleasure—which is love. Every one
        takes pleasure from the fact that he possesses what he loves. In some
        men we find the love of honor; in others, the love of learning. This
        love is not perceived by an external sense but by an apprehension of the
        soul, which is interior. Therefore each of these, i.e., the man who
        loves honor or learning, rejoices on account of what he loves while he
        has it. This joy does not arise as the result of any bodily passion, but
        as a result of the mind’s awareness alone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        601. Then [a], at “Men are not called,” he shows that temperance is not
        concerned with pleasures of the soul. He indicates three classes of
        these pleasures. Some [a, i] that have an appearance of propriety like
        honor and learning, as we have just noted (600), are pleasurable to the
        soul. For this reason he says that men are not called temperate or
        intemperate on account of such pleasures, since temperance seems to
        refer to pleasures which have something of shame about them. Concerned
        with the pleasures of honor and learning there are, however, certain
        other means and extremes pertaining to other virtues, as will be clearly
        shown in the fourth book (792-799).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        602. Second [a, ii], at “Likewise, temperance,” he now recalls other
        pleasures of the soul which consist in the sayings and deeds of men. He
        says that, as temperance is not concerned with pleasures of honor or
        learning, so also it is not concerned with other pleasures which are not
        of the body. Those who love to listen to and tell stories, and who waste
        the whole day talking about all kinds of contingent remarks and deeds
        (unnecessary and useless affairs) are said to be garrulous but we do not
        call them intemperate. The reason is that intemperance has not only a
        futility about it, but also a certain baseness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        603. Third [a, iii], at “Those who are,” he introduces a third class of
        pleasures of the soul which refer to
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        money and friends. Hence he says that those, who are in ordinately
        saddened by the loss of money and friends, are not called intemperate.
        But they can be called vicious from one aspect, because such sorrows do
        not show turpitude but only a disordered condition of the appetite. From
        this, that temperance is not concerned with any class of pleasures of
        the soul, he concludes that it does concern pleasures of the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        604. Then [b], at “but not with all,” he shows that temperance is not
        concerned with all but with some bodily pleasures. First [b, i] he
        discloses that temperance does not regard the pleasures of the three
        senses which perceive through a separate (from the sense organ) medium.
        Next [Lect. 20; b, ii], at “Any use of taste etc.,” he explains in what
        manner temperance regards the pleasures of the other two senses which
        perceive through a contiguous (with the sense organ) medium (B.1118 a
        26). He develops the first point [b, i] in three steps. First [i, x] he
        shows that temperance does not deal with the pleasures of the three
        previously mentioned senses. Next [i, y], at “Other animals do not
        etc.,” he shows that such pleasures do not belong to brutes. Last [i,
        z], at “Temperance and intemperance etc.,” he draws a conclusion from
        what has been said. Regarding the first he excludes the three senses.
        First [x, aa] he proves that temperance does not concern pleasures of
        sight.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        605. He says that temperance is not concerned with all bodily pleasures
        which arise by means of the external external senses. Those who take
        delight in things seen are not on that account called temperate or
        intemperate. He gives examples of three classes of visible objects. Some
        are the proper sensibles of sight, as colors. Others are common
        sensibles, which however are known most particularly through sight, as
        figures, Still others are sensible incidentally, as writing, by reason
        of what is signified through the writing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        606. This does not mean that virtue and vice are not to be encountered
        here. It happens in such matters that a person may take pleasure as he
        oughtthis is the mean, or according to excess and defect, but this
        pertains to curiosity and not to intemperance which regards the more
        vehement pleasures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        607. Next [x, bb], at “Temperance is related,” he proves that temperance
        does not have to do with the pleasures proper to hearing. He says that
        temperance is related in a similar way to the pleasures concerned with
        hearing; neither it nor intemperance is involved. If someone delights
        too much, or as he ought, in melodies (i.e., harmonies of human voices)
        and symphony (that is, the imitation of the human voice achieved through
        instruments) he will not be called temperate or intemperate on this
        account because these are not very vehement pleasures either. But this
        matter can belong to another virtue or vice,
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        608. Third [x, cc], at “The same is to be said,” he proves that
        temperance does not have to do with the pleasures of smell. Regarding
        this we must consider that, as stated in the work
        <i>De Sensu et Sensato</i> (Ch. 5, 443 b 17 sq.; St. Th. Lect. 13,
        177-186), the kinds of scents are distinguished in two ways. In one way
        in themselves. In the other way by a comparison with the species of
        savors. He says then that they are not called temperate and intemperate
        who take reasonable or excessive pleastire in odors considered in
        themselves but only when they take pleasure in odors incidentally, i.e.,
        according as these odors coincide with the pleasures of taste and touch.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        609. We do not call intemperate those who take pleasure in the fragrance
        of apples or roses or incense, which are species of odor in itself, but
        those who take pleasure in the aroma of foods or the perfume of
        cosmetics used by women. The intemperate delight in these pleasures on
        account of memory of certain things they long for. He clearly shows this
        by the example of the hungry who take pleasure in odors that do not
        interest them when they have eaten. So it is evident that these men do
        not take pleasure in odors as such but incidentally. In this way it
        pertains to the intemperate man—to whom the things represented by the
        odors are desirable—to take pleasure in those odors.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        610. At “Other animals do not take” [i, y] he proves that pleasures
        arising from these senses belong only indirectly to other animals. He
        says that the brutes find pleasure via these three senses indirectly,
        i.e., by reference to taste and touch. He clearly shows this first in
        regard to the sense of smell. Hounds do not take pleasure in the scent
        of rabbits on account of the scent itself but on account of the expected
        food, the sensation of which they receive through smell. Second, he
        makes the same point in regard to the sense of hearing. He says that the
        lion takes pleasure in the lowing of an ox because the lion knows from
        the sound that a meal is near. Hence he seems to delight in the bellow
        of the bull, but this is incidental. Third, Aristotle manifests the same
        thing in regard to seeing. He says that the lion does not take pleasure
        even at the sight of the stag or roe (which he calls a wild she-goat)
        when he finds something of this kind, but he is delighted by the hope of
        getting a meal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        611. The reason for these things is that the appetite of the other
        animals is moved by the instinct of nature alone. On this account
        animals take pleasure only in the things referring to the preservation
        of nature; that is why senses of this kind were given them. But senses
        have been given to men for the perception of sensible things leading in
        turn to a knowledge of reason which moves the appetite of man. So it is
        that man takes pleasure in the very appropriateness of sensible things
        considered in themselves, even if they are not ordered to the
        conservation of nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        612. Then [i, z], at “Temperance and intemperance,” he concludes from
        the premises that temperance has to do with such operations or pleasures
        as the other animals have in common with man. The same is true of
        intemperance. Hence pleasures of this kind seem to be servile and
        brutish because what we have in common with irrational animals is
        slavish and naturally subject to reason in us. Such are the pleasures of
        touch and taste which are the two senses besides the three mentioned
        before.

        Any use of taste made by temperance, or intemperance for that matter, is
        small or even non-existent. Taste here means the discernment of flavors,

        Touch, with which intemperance deals, is the most widely shared of all
        the senses. Rightly then intemperance seems worthy of reproach, since it
        does not exist in man as belonging to what is proper to him, but to what
        he has in common with the animals. To take pleasure in things of this
        sort and to love them above everything else is brutish. We exclude those
        pleasures of touch which are especially liberal, for instance, those
        taken in gymnasia by massages and heat-treatment. But the pleasure of
        touch, which the intemperate man seeks, is not that of the whole body
        but of certain parts of the body.

        The desire for food is natural, for everyone—when he is without
        it—desires food and drink (and sometimes both) just as, according to
        Homer [Iliad, xxiv. 130], the young and growing man longs for a bed.

        Not all men, however, do want such and such a bed, or the same kinds of
        food. For this reason such desires seem to be peculiar to each of us,
        although they still have something of the natural. Different people
        enjoy different pleasures, and some persons take more pleasure in
        certain kinds of things than in chance objects.

        In natural desires few men go astray and then only in one way, by
        excess. This happens when men eat or drink even to an immoderate
        fullness, which is an excess in the quantity of food nature requires.
        (Nature desires that its need be supplied.) These people are called
        “belly-mad” because they stuff their stomachs beyond need. Such persons

        But in regard to proper desires, many sin in numerous ways. Those who
        love such pleasures sin in delighting in things they ought not, or more
        than they ought, or as many of the foolish do, or not according to
        measure. The intemperate are excessive in all these ways because they
        enjoy certain odious things they ought not to enjoy. If pleasure may be
        taken, they delight in such things (as many do) more than they ought.
        Therefore, since intemperance is excess in regard to pleasures, it is
        despicable.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        613. After the Philosopher has proved that temperance and intemance do
        not deal with the pleasures of three senses but with the pleasures of
        two, i.e., taste and touch, he shows now [b, ii] what concerns the
        pleasures of taste and touch. He treats this from three aspects. First
        [ii, x] he shows that temperance does not deal directly with the
        pleasures of taste but with the pleasures of touch. Next [ii, y], at “On
        this account etc.,” he clarifies by an example what he has affirmed.
        Finally [ii, z], at “Touch, with which etc.,” he draws a conclusion from
        what has been said. He says first that temperance and intemperance seem
        to make little or no use of what is proper to taste, namely, the
        discernment of flavors. Those who test wine use taste in this way;
        likewise, those who season food and sample to see whether their dishes
        have a delicious taste.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        614. The intemperate do not take much delight in this, and they are not
        deprived of much pleasure when they do not perfectly discern the flavors
        of food. But all their delight consists in the enjoyment of certain
        pleasurable things, for instance, in eating, drinking, and sex—all of
        which occur through touch. It is obvious, therefore, that the pleasure
        of the intemperate has to do directly with the sense of touch, and with
        taste only because flavors make the enjoyment of food delectable. For
        this reason he previously said (608-611i, 613) that intemperance has
        little use for taste, i.e., as it is ordered to touch, or no use, i.e.,
        in respect to what belongs to taste in itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        615. Then [ii, y], at “On this account,” he clarifies by an example what
        he had said. A certain man named Philoxenus Erichius who, since he ate
        his meals greedily, desired to have a throat longer than a crane’s so
        the food would remain a long while in his throat. From this it is
        evident that he did not take pleasure in taste (which is active in the
        tongue and not in the throat) but in touch alone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        616. Next [ii, z], at “Touch, with which,” he draws a corollary from
        what has been said. The sense of touch, which temperance deals with, is
        the most common of all the senses because all the animals share in it.
        On this account intemperance seems to be really despicable since it does
        not exist in man as belonging to what is proper to him, but to what he
        has in common with other animals. But to take pleasure in things of this
        sort and to love them as the highest goods seems to be especially
        animal-like. So it is that vices of intemperance possess the most
        disgusting shamefulness because they make man like the brutes.
        Therefore, by reason of such vices, man is rendered notoriously evil and
        blameworthy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        617. Someone might say that even in things pertaining to touch there is
        some properly human good that is not bestial. In order to answer this
        objection, he adds that we exclude from temperance those pleasures of
        touch that are especially liberal—appropriate for humans—and used
        according to reason. Such pleasures are found in gymnasia by massage and
        heat-treatment in view of the games (since some are going to wrestle or
        indulge in other sports). These pleasures of touch are not ordered to
        the desire of food or sex. The pleasure of touch which the intemperate
        man seeks is not that of the whole body but of certain parts of the
        body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        618. At “Some desires” [13] he shows how the act of temperance (in the
        previously mentioned matter) and of the opposite vices is constituted.
        Here he proceeds in twofold fashion. First [A] he explains his
        proposition. Next [Lect. 22, B’], at “Intemperance is more etc.” (B.
        1119 a 21), he cornpares the vices of intemperance with certain other
        vices. Regarding the first he has three considerations. First [i] he
        treats intemperance, showing in what manner it operates in the
        previously investigated matter. Next [Lect. 21, 2], at “It does
        nothappen etc.,” he treats insensibility (B. 1119 a 5). Last [Lect. 21,
        3], at “The temperate man etc.,” he treats temperance (B. 1119 a 12). In
        regard to the first he does two things. First [a] he shows how
        temperance is related to pleasures. Then [Lect. 21, b], at “With regard
        to sorrows etc.,” how it is related to sorrow (B.1118 b 29). Fear and
        sorrow are ordered to the same thing—we noted this before (584)—because
        sorrow has to do with present evils, as fear with future ones. So also
        desire (which concerns future goods) and pleasure (which concerns
        present goods) are ordered to the same thing. Temperance is in the
        reason concerned with sensual desires and pleasures First [a, i] he
        makes a certain division of desires. Next [a, ii], at “The desire for
        food etc.,” he explains the division. Last [a, iii], at “In natural
        desires etc.,” he shows in what manner intemperance deals with both
        desires.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        619. He says first that some desires are common and others are proper,
        being in addition to the common.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        620. Then [a, ii], at “The desire for food,” he explains this division.
        First [a, ii, x] he points out what the common desires are, saying that
        the desire for food in general is natural, as following the whole nature
        of the species and genus. Hence every man desires dry nourishment called
        food or moist nourishment called drink—and sometimes both—in order to
        succor a natural need, just as according to Homer every man (the young
        as well as the growing, i.e., the adolescent) longs for a bed to rest
        in.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        621. Next [a, ii, y], at “Not all men however,” he points out what the
        proper desires are, saying that not all men want this particular bed—say
        a couch strewn with feathers and costly covering. Likewise, not everyone
        craves such and such a food, an expensive dish for example, or one
        daintily prepared. All do not yearn for the same gratification, but in
        such matters some desire one thing, others another. Hence desires of
        this kind seem to be our very own because we are not inclined to them by
        nature but by our own devising. Here nothing hinders a thing from being
        natural as belonging to the nature of the individual, although it may
        not belong to the nature of the genus or species. We see that different
        people enjoy different pleasures according to their different
        temperaments. And because of natural temperament, some persons take more
        pleasure in certain kinds of things than in other commonplace objects.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        622. At “In natural desires” [a, iii] he explains in what manner
        intemperance has to do with the desires just mentioned. He says that in
        the natural desires that are common [a, iii, x] few men go astray. Here
        transgression occurs only in one way, according as someone takes more
        than nature requires. This happens when someone eats or drinks what is
        given him in an immoderate amount, in which there is an excess in regard
        to the quantity of food nature needs. Nature desires only that the need
        be supplied. Therefore, that someone should take more than he needs is
        an excess above nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        623. People of this type are called “belly-mad” (<i>gastrimargoi</i>:
        from <i>gastir</i> meaning belly and <i>marges</i> meaning a raving or
        madness) as if they had a raving or mad stomach, because they stuff
        nature beyond requirement. Such persons are very brutish because their
        only concern is to fill their bellies without discrimination like
        animals.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        624. Next [a, iii, y], at “But in regard to proper desires,” he explains
        in what manner intemperance has to do willi proper desires or pleasures.
        He says that in regard to them, many sin in numerous ways, i.e.,
        according to all the circumstances. Those who love such pleasures sin
        because they enjoy things they should not (like eating food which does
        not agree with them) or they sin by taking more enjoyment than they
        should (for instance, someone takes too much pleasure in eating
        agreeable dishes). Others sin by taking pleasure in foods without
        discernment—like most fools do—or finally they do not observe due
        measure in enjoyment, as they should. The intemperate are excessive in
        all these ways because they enjoy objects highly indecorous and
        blameworthy by nature, which they ought not to enjoy. Even when pleasure
        in certain things may be lawful, they commonly take more enjoyment than
        they ought without discrimination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        625. So he concludes that, since intemperance is excess in regard to
        pleasures of this kind, it is blameworthy like other excesses, as was
        explained in the second book (333-334).

        With regard to sorrows, one is not—as in fortitude—called temperate
        because he faces them, nor intemperate because he does not undergo them.
        But the intemperate man grieves more than he ought because he does not
        attain the pleasures he desires. But his pleasure is what causes him
        grief. On the contrary, the temperate man does not grieve for absent
        things, and in abstention from pleasure.

        The intemperate man then desires all pleasures and he especially desires

        things in preference to all others. For this reason the intemperate man
        is saddened when he does not get the pleasure he wants; his desire in
        fact brings sorrow. He is like the incontinent person who is also

        It does not happen too often that men become deficient in pleasure,
        taking less enjoyment than they ought. Insensibility of this kind is not
        in keeping with human nature because the other animals differentiate
        foods in this, that they take pleasure in some things, and in others
        they do not. If someone finds no joy in anything and does not prefer one
        thing to another, he is a long way from being human. As this rarely

        The temperate man follows the golden mean in these matters. He does not
        delight in those shameful things in which the intemperate man takes the
        keenest pleasure, but rather he is saddened if they occur. In no way
        does he rejoice in things more ardently than he ought. He is not
        unnecessarily saddened by the absence of pleasurable things. If he
        desires them, he does so in the right measure. He does not crave

        The temperate man desires whatever pleasures are useful to the health
        and well-being of the body, and he wants them according to right measure
        and as he ought. He desires other pleasures only if they are not a
        hindrance to health, nor opposed to what is honorable, nor beyond his
        means. One who is otherwise disposed takes more enjoyment than is
        reasonable. The temperate man is not of this nature but he acts
        according to right reason.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        626. After the Philosopher has defined in what way temperance is
        concerned with pleasures, he now explains how it is concerned with
        sorrows. On this point he does two things. First [(1) b] he shows that
        the brave, the temperate, and the intemperate are alfccted in different
        ways by sorrow. Then [(1) c], at “The intemperate mail then etc.,” he
        makes clear his assertion. He says first that the brave, the temperate,
        and the intemperate are not disposed toward sorrow in the same way. The
        brave man indeed suffers many sorrows, but he is praised for this very
        endurance which is done nobly. This has already been remarked (584,
        596). The temperate man however is not praised because he undergoes
        sorrows. Nor is the intemperate man blamed for not undergoing them,
        although the cowardly man is blamed. But the intemperate man is censured
        for the f act that he grieves more than he should. His sorrow does not
        arise from any harmful thing threatening him—which is the cause of the
        coward’s sorrow—but he is sorry because he does not get the pleasures he
        wants. Thus it is by its very absence that pleasure causes him grief. On
        the contrary the temperate man is praised for not grieving and for
        undertaking to abstain from pleasures that he does not desire very much.
        An effect that follows from the presence of a cause is more important
        than an effect that follows from its absence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        627. For this very reason fortitude is primarily concerned with sorrows
        which follow from the presence of harmful things. Temperance, however,
        is secondarily concerned with sorrows that follow from the absence of
        pleasures but primarily with pleasures following from the presence of
        pleasurable things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        628. Then [(i) c], at “The intemperate man then” he makes evident his
        assertion, that pleasure is the occasion of sorrow for the intemperate
        man. This happens because the intemperate man desires all pleasurable
        things. He strives after pleasure itself. On this account he strives
        after everything giving pleasure and he strives after the thing
        pleasurable in the highest degree in comparison with which he cares less
        for other delightful things. Therefore his pleasure is not guided by
        reason, but led by sensual desire to choose pleasurable
        things—especially those which are most abundantly so—in preference to
        all other useful and honorable goods. The intemperate put aside what is
        useful and decent in order that they may obtain pleasure. For this
        reason the intemperate man is saddened when he does not get the pleasure
        he wants. Sensual desire brings sorrow when it does not gain the thing
        coveted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        629. Although, according to a superficial likelihood, it seems
        incongruous that anyone should be saddened by reason of pleasure,
        nevertheless’ it is true that the intemperate man is distressed by
        pleasure. He is saddened only by its absence, like a ship lost by the
        absence of its pilot.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        630. Next [2], at “It does not happen,” he considers the vice opposite
        to temperance which falls short in regard to pleasures. He says it does
        not happen very often that men become deficient in pleasures (so that
        they take less enjoyment than they ought, i.e., than is required for the
        health and well-being of the body and for decent living with others) in
        which this vice consists and which we have called insensibility in the
        second book (262, 342). This defect is not in keeping with human nature
        because the other animals differentiate foods in this, that they take
        pleasure in some, and in others not. So it seems to belong to the common
        nature of the genus to take some pleasure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        631. Therefore, if there is anyone, who does not take pleasure in
        anything, he seems to be a long way from being human. Because this
        rarely happens, he who falls short in this manner does not have a
        special name, except that before (262, 342) we called him insensible.
        When men abstain from pleasures for a useful or honorable reason, as
        merchants for gain and soldiers for victory, we do not have instances of
        insensibility. This is not beyond what is reasonable, as is the case
        with the vice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        632. At “The temperate man follows” [3], he explains in what way the
        temperate man should conduct himself in regard to the matter previously
        mentioned. He clarifies this point in two stages. First [3, a] he shows
        from what things the temperate should abstain, Next [3, b], at “The
        temperate man desires etc.,” he shows what things the temperate man
        should enjoy and in what manner. He says first that the temperate man
        follows the golden mean regarding the preceding, i.e., pleasure, sorrow,
        and desire. First in regard to pleasure, he does not delight in those
        shameful things in which the intemperate take pleasure but rather is
        saddened if any such thing should occur. In general he does not rejoice
        in things he ought not, nor does he rejoice more ardently than he ought.
        Likewise he is not excessive according to any other circumstance. Next,
        in respect to sorrow he is not saddened beyond measure by the absence of
        pleasurable, things. Third, in respect to desire he does not long for
        absent pleasures, because he cares little for them, or he longs for them
        in the right measure which is not excessive; he does not crave pleasure
        more than he ought, nor when he ought not, nor according to any other
        circumstance exceeding the norm of reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        633. Then [3, b], at “The temperate man desires,” he shows which
        pleasures the temperate man enjoys and in what way. He says that the
        temperate man desires whatever pleasures are useful to the health of the
        body or its well-being so that he may be prompt and unimpeded for the
        things of this kind which he has to do. He desires these pleasures,
        however, according to the right measure and as he ought. If there are
        other pleasures not necessary for the two reasons previously named, the
        temperate man desires them under the three following conditions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        634. First, that they are not hindrances to health and well-being, like
        superfluous food or drink. Second, that they are not contrary to good,
        i.e., opposed to decency, like the pleasure of fornication. Third, that
        they are not beyond his means, i.e., they do not exceed a man’s power to
        possess, as would be the case if a poor man desired to enjoy foods which
        are too costly. One who is so disposed that he longs for pleasures
        harmful to health and well-being, and contrary to decency, or exceeding
        his means takes more enjoyment than is reasonable. This does not pertain
        to the temperate man who loves these pleasures in conformity with right
        reason.

        Intemperance is more like the voluntary than fear is, because the former
        is motivated by pleasure, and the latter by pain. One of these
        (pleasure) is to be chosen, the other (pain) is to be avoided.

        There does not appear to be a likeness in voluntariety between fear
        itself and individual cases of it. Fear itself seems to be painless, but
        particular cases stupefy men by reason of pain, so that they throw away

        This transference does not seem to be unsuitable. He who strives after
        what is base and increases greatly in evil must be punished. In this,
        sensual desire and the child are alike. Children live in accord with
        sensual desire and they strive most of all after pleasure. Therefore, if
        it will not be properly obedient, sensual desire will come to rule and
        increase considerably. To a stupid person the desire for pleasure is
        insatiable and omnipresent; and the exercise of desire increases its
        natural power. For the appetites are strong and violent, going even to
        the extent of interrupting the act of reasoning.

        For this reason sensual desire and pleasure must be moderated, that is,
        sense pleasures must be few in number and in no way contrary to reason.
        Such a state is what we call obedient and disciplined. As a child must
        live according to the instructions of his tutor, so the concupiscent
        part must conform to reason; each, i.e., the tutor and reason aspires to
        the good. And the temperate man desires the right things at the right
        time as reason disposes. These then are the things we have to say about
        temperance.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        635. After the Philosopher has treated the act of temperance and the
        opposite vices, he now compares the sin of intemperance with other sins
        [B’]. He makes two points here. First [1] he compares intemperance with
        the vice of cowardice; and then, with the sins of children, at “We
        transfer the name” [2]. He clarifies the first point by a twofold
        distinction. First [1, a] he shows that intemperance has more of the
        voluntary than cowardice has. Next [1, b], at “There does not appear
        etc.,” he shows that the voluntary in each vice is found in a different
        order. In regard to the first he does two things. First [a, i] he
        explains that intemperance has more of the voluntary than cowardice has.
        Next [a, ii], at “For this reason intemperance etc.,” he infers a
        corollary from his discussion. He says first that intemperance is more
        like the voluntary than fear is, because intemperance has more of the
        voluntary. He proves this by two reasons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        636. The first of these is taken from what follows the voluntary and the
        involuntary as a property [i, x]. Everyone delights in what he does
        voluntarily, but is sad over what is contrary to his will. It is obvious
        that the intemperate man acts for the pleasure he desires. The coward,
        on the other hand, acts because of the pain which he flees. (Of course
        the operation of both is pleasing because not only is actual pleasure a
        matter for joy but even the hope of future pleasure.) But pain is a
        thing to be avoided and consequently is contrary to the will. So it is
        evident that intemperance is caused by what is of itself voluntary.
        Cowardice, however, is caused by something involuntary and repugnant.
        Therefore intemperance comes closer to the voluntary than cowardice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        637. He gives the second reason at “Pain stupefies” [i, y]. This is
        taken from the fact that ignorance causes an involuntary. Because pain
        follows from the presence of some contrary and harmful principle, it
        stupefies and corrupts the nature of its possessor. So it is that the
        mind of man is impeded by pain from proper knowledge. But pleasure is
        caused by the presence of an agreeable object that does not corrupt the
        nature. Hence pleasure does not stupefy nor corrupt the mind of the one
        who takes pleasure. From this it follows that intemperance, which
        operates on account of pleasure, has more of the voluntary than fear
        does -which is caused by pain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        638. Then [a, ii], at “For this reason intemperance,” he concludes that,
        since in voluntary acts praise is due to the good and blame to the evil,
        the vice of intemperance is more disgraceful than the vice of cowardice
        which has less of the voluntary. To this he adds also another reason
        taken from the fact that a vice is more worthy of reproach insofar as it
        is more easily avoidable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        639. Each vice can be avoided by the contrary habit. For two reasons it
        is easy to become accustomed to good actions in matters of temperance.
        First, because pleasures in food, drink, and so forth take place very
        often in man’s life. Hence there is no lack of opportunity to get used
        to virtuous actions in such matters. Second, becoming accustomed to good
        deeds of temperance does not constitute a danger. A person does not run
        any great risk in abstaining at times from some pleasure of touch. But
        quite the reverse is true in the vice of cowardice because the dangers
        from war happen rarely. Besides it is dangerous to get mixed up in wars.
        It follows then that the vice of intemperance is more worthy of reproach
        than the vice of cowardice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        640. Next [1, b], at “There does not appear” he shows that the voluntary
        in each vice is not found in the same order. First [1, b, i] he shows in
        what order the voluntary is found in cowardice; and second in
        intemperance, at “In regard to intemperance etc. [1, b, ii]. He says
        first that fear does not seem to be voluntary in the same way for the
        universal and for particular cases. Universals seem to be without pain,
        for example, anyone may go into battle and attack the enemy. But
        particular happenings, for instance, that a man is wounded or routed or
        suffers other misfortune, bring such great pain that men are stupefied
        on account of these things-so much so that they throw away their arms
        and do other disgraceful actions. Hence, since in reference to the
        universal these acts are voluntary, and in reference to the particular
        they become involuntary, they seem to be done under compulsion (inasmuch
        as a man is induced by an external principle to give up what he had
        previously wished).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        641. At “In regard to intemperance” [1, b, ii ], he shows what the order
        is in regard to intemperance. He says that in this case the order is
        reversed, for singular things are voluntary in the highest degree
        because they occur in accordance with what a man strives for and
        desires. But the whole, considered in the abstract, is less
        voluntary-for instance, that anyone should commit adultery. No one
        desires to be intemperate in general. However particular things, by
        which a man becomes intemperate, are delightful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        642. The reason for this difference is taken from this: pain that causes
        fear pertains to the involuntary, as pleasure that causes intemperance
        pertains to the voluntary. Every inclination of the soul towards
        particular things is rather vehement. For this reason cowardice
        regarding particular things has more of the involuntary but intemperance
        more of the voluntary. Therefore in sins of intemperance it is
        exceedingly harmful to dwell upon the thought by which a man comes down
        to the particular that entices the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        643. Then [2], at “We transfer the name,” he compares the vice of
        intemperance with the sins of children. First [2, a] he states the
        agreement as to the name. Next [2, b], at “This transference etc.,” he
        assigns the reason for the agreement. He says first that the name
        intemperance is transferred to the sins of children. This is more
        apparent in our language on the part of the virtue than on the part of
        the vice. We call chastity a species of temperance, as we say that
        disciplined children are chastened. And those who are not disciplined
        can be called unchastised. So too one who is not chaste is said to be
        “incestuosus” (<i>in-castus</i>). The reason for this transference is
        that sins of this kind have a certain likeness, as will be shown later
        (647). But which of these is named from the other does not concern us
        now. It is clear, however, that the thing given the name later was
        called after that which had the name earlier.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        644. Next [2, b], at “This transference,” he assigns the reason for the
        previous transference in accordance with the likeness of the sin of
        intemperance to the sins of children. First [2, b, i] in respect to the
        necessity of chastising or restraining; and second 12, b, ii] in respect
        to the manner of chastising and restraining, at “For this reason sensual
        desire etc.” He says first that the transference of this name from one
        sin to another does not seem to be unsuitable because of the likeness
        according to which the transferences are made. It is necessary to
        punish, i.e., chastise and discipline, one who strives after improper
        things and whose evil inclination is greatly increasedpoints on which
        sensual desire and the child are in agreement.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        645. This agreement seems to be reasonable because children live
        especially in accord with sensual desire, since they strive most of all
        after pleasure, which belongs to the nature of sensual desire. The
        reason why they strive after pleasure will be given in the seventh book
        (1531). Therefore, if the child and sensual desire are not rightly
        restrained by reason, they come to rule and increase so that the
        appetite for pleasure, i.e., sensual desire, will be lord and master.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        646. The reason for this is that the desire of pleasure is insatiable;
        indeed the more pleasure is enjoyed, the more it is desired in that
        pleasure itself is desirable. Hence, just as with a child and a
        simpleton so with sensual desire-the proper operation increases what is
        innate, i.e., that which is like them. If a child and a simpleton should
        be allowed to work according to their folly, the folly increases more in
        them. When a man satisfies sensual desire, it increases more in him and
        becomes master. This is especially true if sensual desire or pleasure is
        great by reason of the object, that is, things very delightful and also
        vehement for the man who desires and takes pleasure. This man is so
        influenced by pleasures that they may impede his knowledge or reasoning.
        The power of thought remains more efficient, the less sensual desire can
        dominate.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        647. Then [2, b, ii], at “For this reason sensual desire,” he shows the
        likeness between the two sins in respect to the manner of chastising or
        restraining. He says that, since sensual desire and pleasure are
        vehement, they grow by themselves. For this reason they must be
        moderated, i.e., not excessive in extent or in vehemence of inclination
        or in number. They must not be contrary to reason in any way, especially
        in regard to the species of sensual desire or pleasure taken on the part
        of the object. That which is so disposed in the matter of sensual
        desires and pleasures is said to be readily obedient and chastised,
        i.e., corrected by reason. As a child must live according to the
        instructions of his tutor, so the faculty of sensual desire must be in
        conformity with reason. Each, i.e., reason and the tutor, aspires to the
        good. The concupiscent part in the temperate man is so disposed that he
        desires the right things, in the right way, and at the right time—as
        reason directs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        648. He says in conclusion that these are the things we have discussed
        about temperance. With this the third book ends.
