And he spoke the words of this song on the day when the Lord rescued him from the hands of his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. And this psalm, word for word, is to be found in 2 Kings 22. The story is, as in 1 Kings 19, how Saul sought to kill him: and when Saul had died, 2 Kings 2: Again Abner and his son were against him.</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Tandem victoriam habuit David contra eos. Et ideo fecit hunc psalmum. Et Hieronymus dicit idem. Et quia per David significatur Christus, omnia ista referri possunt ad Christum, vel secundum caput, vel secundum corpus, scilicet ecclesiam quia liberata est a Saule, idest morte: Saul enim interpretatur petitio, quia ad petitionem populi datus fuit, immo potius extortus. unde non fuit datus ad permanendum.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">In the end David was victorious over them. And on this account he made this psalm. And Jerome says the same thing. And since Christ is signified by David, all these things can be referred to Christ, either according to the head, or according to the body, namely the Church, which is liberated from Saul, that is, from death: the name "Saul" is translated as "petition", because he was given, or rather extorted (from God) because the people asked for him, and he was not given so that he would remain for any length of time.</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Sic Christus primo sustinet mortem, postea remanet quietus, secundum glossam.

In secunda ostendit potentiam liberantis, ibi, commota est. In tertia modum liberationis, ibi, misit de summo etc..</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Thus Christ first bore death, then there was a time of quiet, according to the gloss. He was also liberated from all his enemies, the Jews and demons, and with respect to his body, that is, the Church. This part is divided into three. In the first part he recalls the benefit of liberation in general terms. In the second part he shows the power of the one who liberates, where he writes, and it was moved. In the third part, he shows the mode of liberation, where he writes, he sent from the high place etc..</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Circa primum duo facit. Primo commemorat affectum quem concepit ex beneficio praedicto. In secundo ostendit effectum inde sequentem, ibi, laudans. Duplex affectus surrexit in eo ex hujusmodi beneficio; scilicet amoris et spei. Et primo ponit primum. Secundo secundum, ibi, Deus meus. Primo ponit affectum amoris ad Deum. Secundo rationem ejus, ibi, fortitudo. Dicit ergo: o domine qui me liberasti, ego semper, diligam te, quia in te manebo: Jo. 15: manete in dilectione: Ro. 8: certus sum, quia neque vita neque mors, neque angeli, neque creatura alia poterit nos separare a caritate Christi.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">With regard to the first he does two things. First, he recalls the emotion that he conceived from the aforesaid benefit. In the second he shows the effect that follows from this, where he writes, praising. A twofold emotion arises in him from this sort of benefit; namely, the emotion of love and the emotion of hope. First, he presents the first emotion. Second, he presents the second, where he writes, my God. Second, he presents the reason for this, where he writes, fortitude. He says therefore: O Lord, who has freed me, I will always love you because I will abide in you: John 15: stay fixed in love: Romans 8: I am certain that neither life nor death, nor angels, nor any other creature can separate us from the love of Christ.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Diligere enim est rationabilium, amare generale est: Judic. 5: qui diligunt te, sicut sol in ortu suo splendet, ita rutilant. Ratio autem dilectionis alicujus est propter proprium bonum. Unde quando quis reputat bonum suum dependere ab aliquo, haec est ratio quare diligat eum. David reputabat totum bonum suum a Deo; unde dicit, diligam te, quia tu es fortitudo mea.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">To love (diligere) is proper to rational beings, while to love (amare) has a general sense: Judges 5: Those who love you (diligere) while shine like that sun in its rising, thus will they sparkle. The reason for one's love (dilection) of something is on account of his own good. Hence when somone reckons that his own good depends upon another, this is the reason for loving (diligere) that other person. David reckoned that all his good was from God; hence he says, I will love (diligere) you, because you are my strength.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Fortitudo habet firmare animum, ne quis recedat a bono propter difficultates imminentes. Quomodo autem sit ejus fortitudo, ostendit. Homo indiget fortitudine ad duo. Primo in bonis, ut stabiliatur in eis: et ideo dicit, Dominus firmamentum, idest firmum fundamentum: 2 Reg. 22: Dominus petra mea: Matth. 7: Omnis qui audit verba mea et facit ea, similis est viro aedificanti domum suam supra petram.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">The role of fortitude is to make the mind firm, lest someone draw back from the good because of the difficulties that threaten. He shows the qualities of this fortitude. A man needs fortitude for two things. First, he needs fortitude in good things, to be established in them: and so he says, the Lord is a firm thing, that is, a firm foundation: 2 Kings 22: The Lord is my rock: Matt. 7: Everyone who hears my words and does them, is like a man who builds his house upon a rock.</font>
      <tr valign="top">

First, before they come, so that he may flee: Prov. 14: The name of the Lord is the strongest tower: Psal. 103: The rock is a refuge for hedge hogs. In another way, after the evils have taken place, that he will liberate; hence he says, and my liberator.</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">(b) <i>Deus meus.</i> Hic ponit affectum spei: et differt inter spem et amorem: quia amor est vis unitiva: amamus enim aliquid inquantum reputamus illud nostrum; et ideo dicit quod ipse est fortitudo sua: isa. 12: fortitudo et laus mea Dominus, et factus est mihi in salutem. Spes importat defensionem ab extrinseco; et utrumque Deus facit.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">(b) <i>My God.</i> Here he presents the emotion of hope: and there is a difference between hope and love: because love is a unitive power: for we love something insofar as we deem it is ours; and therefore he says that He is his strength: Isaiah 12: My strength and my praise is the Lord, and He has become salvation for me. Hope implies protection from something outside; and God does both.</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Vel sic. Objectum spei est bonum arduum futurum, possibile adipisci. Sicut ergo quis amat propter bonum jam datum, ita sperat futurum ex fiducia ex amore concepta, et ex similibus, inquantum credit similia in futurum recipere. Et ideo hic tria facit. Primo sperat refugium et firmamentum quod est in bonis. Secundo petit protectorium quod est in malis, quae jam evenerunt. Dicit ergo primo, Deus meus adjutor meus: Psal. 95: Nisi quia Dominus adjuvit me, paulo minus habitasset in inferno anima mea etc.. Et ideo sperabo in eum: Eccl. 2: Qui timetis Dominum, sperate in illum, et cum oblectatione venient vobis misericordiae.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Or thus. The object of hope is a difficult future good, something that is possible to achieve. Thus, just as someone loves (another) an account of a good already given, so he hopes for a future good out of a confidence that is conceived from love, and from like things, insofar as believes that he will receive like things in the future. And therefore he does these three things. First he hopes for the refuge and firm foundation that is in good things. Second, he asks for protection in evil things that have already occurred. Therefore he says first, my God, my helper: Psalm 95: Were not the Lord my help, I would have soon dwelt in the grave etc.. And thus I will hope in him: Eccl. 2: You who fear the Lord, hope in him, and mercies will come to you with delight.</font>

Hieronymus habet, scutum, quod protegit ne transfigi possit a malis; sic facit Deus: Ps. 63: protexisti me Deus a conventu malignantium. Quantum ad secundum dicit, et cornu salutis, quia animalia cornu impingunt; ita virtus Dei contra adversarios resistit, quia pugnat, ut vincat mala temporalia et spiritualia: Psal. 43: in te inimicos nostros ventilabimus cornu: et in nomine tuo spernemus insurgentes in nobis: 1 Reg. 2: Exultavit cor meum in Domino, et exaltatum est cornu meum in Deo meo, idest virtus mea.</font>

First, we hope not to be harmed. Second, we hope that we may conquer them and that He crowns us for victory. With respect to the first he says, my protector. Jerome has the word shield, which protects someone so he cannot be pierced by evils; God does this: Ps. 63: God, you have protected me from the gathering of evil doers. With respect to the second he says, and the horn of salvation, because animals pierce with their horns; thus the power of God resists adversaries, because He fights to conquer temporal and spiritual evils: Psalm 43: In you we will ventilate our enemies with a horn: and in your name we will remove those who rise up among us: 1 Kings 2: My heart exulated in the Lord, and my horn is raise in my God, that is, my power.</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">With respect to the third, and my support. When someone is victorious, he is received with a triumpth; God also does this: John 14: I will come again and receive you do myself, so that you will be where I am: Ps. 72: you have received me with glory. A like passage is found in 2 Kings 22. Consequently he presents the effect that follows from this, namely praise. Praise is speech that makes clear that greatness of power, or at least it follows from this. First, therefore, he presents praise. Second, the effective power of praise. He says, therefore, praising, I will call upon the Lord; as if to say: from this, I do not have proper praise, but I will seek your praise, because you have acted; Isaiah 63: I will remember the mercies of the Lord: the praise of the Lord over all that He has given me. And I will invoke You, free of care with effective power, because when I call upon you in this way, I will be saved from my enemies: Joel (the end) whoever will call upon the name of the Lord, will be saved.</font>

And thus he first speaks of the first step. Second, he speaks of the second step, that they go from death to hell, where he writes, the pains of hell etc.. First he does two things.

A torrent is a flow of water that is running downhill with force: Job 6: Like a torrent that suddenly passes through in the valleys.

It is made known by Him: Romans 1: The anger of God has been revealed from heaven over all the impiety and injustice of those men who hold back the truth of God in injustice.</font>

An angry master makes his servant tremble, and a lion causes a cub to tremble. With regard to this, it should be known that the virtue which contains the members is outwardly lost, and returns within, for example, to the heart as one fleeing, and it gives in to some imagined evil: or it gives in to a power that rises against it, a power that it cannot resist, and the members tremble, like a wall when the foundation is struck. For the soul contains the body, and it is like the foundation of the body; and the part of the soul contains the part of the body. Hence, when the foundation is struck, the wall is struck; and when a power is struck, the member is struck. Thus in an animal, the effect of anger is shaking.</font>

For we see that the body immediately trembles when it imagines an evil that the body cannot resist; it does not tremble from knowledge, but by a certain natural order, that is, naturally, insofar as the power of the imagined evil is greater. And likewise God, when He directs his power over the earth, although the earth does not know anger, it naturally trembles. The foundations, that is, certain concavities like concave earth, and when this is moved that mountains are struck.</font>

And fire, that is, the smoke that is called fire also by the philosopher in the beginning of the Metaphysics, as if it did not have a proper name: just as the humid exhalation which is called steam; but it is called fire, because it is disposed to rise, and because it is hot and dry like fire.</font>

Materia autem terraemotus subtiliata per calorem solis expirat a terra: et sic cessat terraemotus et fit ventus. Causa terraemotus est impulsio unius venti ab alio: et propterea non potest esse in tota terra simul, sed durant per ducenta miliaria ad plus, ut dicit Seneca. Et dicit quod terraemotus divisit Siciliam a Calabria, et Hispaniam ab Africa. Et durat aliquando per quadraginta dies; aliquando per unum annum. Item nota quod terra solida a qua non potest vapor exire exterius, apta est ut cito moveatur: ea enim quae est de natura lapidea, non leviter movetur et concutitur; oportet tamen ab aliqua parte porosam esse, unde ingrediatur vapor; ut per poros intret, et per soliditatem contineatur.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">One sign that wind is the cause of earthquakes is that before an earthquake the air usually becomes tranquil without wind; but after the earthquake there are winds. The matter of an earthquake is made fine by the heat of the sun and breathes out from the earth; and so the earthquake ceases and the wind begins. The cause of an earthquake is one wind being pushed by another; and on this account there cannot be an earthquake at the same time over the whole earth, but they extend over two hundred miles at the most, as Seneca says. And Seneca says that it was an earthquake that divided Sicily from Calabria, and Spain from Africa. And sometimes an earthquake lasts forty days; sometimes a whole year. Again, note that solid earth from which vapor cannot leave is apt to be quickly moved; for such earth is of a stony nature, it is not moved lightly and it is struck; however, it must be porous in some part, from which the vapor enters; as the vapor enters by pores and is contained by solidity.</font>

And again, because that which is hot does not descend, and the waves of the sea that close the pores work together to this end, and enclose it below for cold. Again, note that this vapor continuously leaves the earth to some extent, and on this account, in time of earthquakes animals that carry their heads close to the earth are often thereby affected by the poisonous vapor that comes out of the earth.</font>

And so in the Psalm of Jerome it is also said word for word, he rode upon the Cherubim. And they have a false imagination, because the things that are said using images in Scripture, are sings of a spiritual truth. Divine wisdom is said to be moved, insofar as it causes movement in mobile things. Whatever God causes in this things below, he causes by the ministry of a spiritual creature: hence Augustine says that God moves the physical creature by the mediation of a spiritual creature: but the spiritual creature does not do this by his own power, but God presides. And the Cherubinm are said especially to do this, because Cherubim translates as fullness of knowledge: and God makes all things by his knowledge.</font>

If someone great humilates someone small from a village, he is said to cause insult and dejection to the entire place over which he presides. Thus the son of man is said to humiliate himself and bend down the heavens, because he wanted to come to as as someone humble. He came down, that is, he appeared as visible: Baruch 3: after these things he was seen in the lands, and he conversed with men. 1 John 1: That which we have seen and heard and what our hands have touched of the word of life.</font>

And darkness, that is devil and all evil men, under his feet, that is, the feet of Christ: Psalm 109: I will make your enemies your foot stool. He speaks of the ascenscion, he ascended above (upon) the Cherubim. Eph. 4: He who descended is the very one who ascended above all the heavens to make complete all things. Over (or upon) the Cherubim, that is, over the orders of angels: Eph. 1: seating him at his right hand in the heavens above every principality, virtue and domination etc.. And he has put all things under Christ's feet and has made him the head over the whole church, which is his body. Jer. 32: O most mighty, great, and powerful, the Lord of hosts is thy name. Great in counsel, and incomprehensible in thought.</font>

He flew, he flew - a two-fold flight is understood here. First, insofar as his fame grew through the whole world in a short time after his ascension; hence he says, on the wings of the winds, that is, more than wings or feathers that are scattered by a gust of wind, because in a short, less than three years: Psalm 18: their sound went through the whole earth.. because it was before the destruction of Jerusalem. Or, he flew etc. When he ascended into heaven he became invisible, and he flew from our sight: Acts 1: A cloud took him from our eyes.</font>

Hence we read in Book 5 of De Causis, that the first cause is higher than all telling: and tongues do not cease from the telling of it, unless it is because they cease or fail from the telling of his being, which is above every cause. And the commentator says that there is no judgement or knowledge of him. And he made the darkness, etc.. as was said, that here the darkness is mentioned to show the marvelous power of God, by which David was set free, and the darkness can refer figuratively to physical effects, and mystically to spiritual effects.</font>

Et quia de ventis supra dictum est, dicendum est de pluviis in aere. Secundum ergo nubes et pluvias, invenimus duplicem commutationem in aere; unam de sereno in nubilum, aliam de nubilo in serenum.

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">First, therefore, the psalmist mentions the excellence of the divine power in the air, as he expounding upon the physical effects. And he does this in three ways: namely, with respect to the winds, with respect to the rains and cloudes, and with respect to lightning. And because he spoke above of the winds, he is going to speak of the rains in the air. With respect to clouds and rains, we find a twofold change in the air; a change from clear sky to cloudy, and a change from cloudy to clear. First, therefore, he presents the first change. Second, the second change, where he says, at the brightness that was before him. He does three things with respect to the first. First, he shows the obscurity of the cloudy season.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Secundo adhibet similitudinem. Tertio ponit obscuritatis causam.

Et posuit similitudinem de tabernaculo: et ideo dicit, in circuitu ejus tabernaculum ejus. Tabernaculum enim ponitur et deponitur sicut nubes. Dicit, tenebrosa aqua in nubibus aeris. Consequenter agit de secunda. Prae fulgore etc. et utitur tali similitudine: quando venit lux, expelluntur tenebrae; et sic Deo ostendente lumen suum, fugit obscuritas nebularum.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Second, he uses a likeness. Third, he presents the cause of the obscurity. Therefore he says with regard to the first: he made the darkness his covert. It is said that God dwells in heaven. Hence when the clouds cover heaven, God seems to dwell in a hidden place: Ezech. 32: I will cover the heaven with cloud. And he presents a comparison with a tent: and therefore he says, his tent around him. A tent is set up and taken down like the clouds. He says, the dark water in the clouds of the air. Following this, he treats the second. At the brightness etc.., and he uses a likeness: when the light comes, the darkness is cast out; and so when God shows his light, the obscurity of the clouds flees.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Et ideo dicit: prae fulgore in conspectu ejus nubes transierunt, prae fulgore luminis a facie tua nubes transierunt, sicut fulgore sive splendore solis, nubes fugiunt et liquefiunt, ut in Lib. Meteo. dicitur. Dali vel titiones ponuntur in transitu nubium: quia similem causam generationis habet grando et fulgur, sive ignis. Antiqui vero dicunt, quod generantur in loco supremo; quod ostendit fortiorem congelationem a forti frigore causari. Unde plus requirit de frigore nix quam aqua: pluviae et grando plus quam nix: et tantum potest esse frigus, quod statim condensat in grandinem: aliquando prius in aquam, et postea in grandinem.

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">And thus he says: at the brightness in your sight the clouds pass, at the brightness of the light from your face the clouds pass, as at the brightness or splendor of the sun, the clouds flee and are dissolved, as we read in the Book of Meteorology. Torches or sparks are made in the passing of the clouds, because hail and lightning, or fire, have a similar cause of generation. The ancients said that they are generated in the highest place: which shows that they are causes by a stronger freezing from a stronger cold. Hence snow requires more cold than water: rain and hail require more than snow: and the cold can be so great that it at ounce condenses into hail: sometimes first into water, and then into hail. And they say, that vapors that are raised higher are frozen greatly, and therefore larger hailstones are made.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Sed philosophus e contra dicit, quod grossiores essent in montibus, et in hyeme: cujus contrarium videmus, quia grossiores sunt in valle, et fiunt in vere et autumno, et generantur in loco propinquo. Item secundum philosophum, aliquando veniunt angulares, quod est signum quod veniunt de propinquo: anguli enim citius liquefiunt. Unde sciendum, quod naturale est quod oppositum fortius agat in oppositum. Constat autem quod in nubibus admiscetur frigidum et calidum; ergo quando calor aeris circumstans constringit frigidum quod non potest consumere, tunc frigidum agit interius circumdante extra calore.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">But the philosopher says on the contary, if this were so they would be thicker in the mountains and in the winter: but we see the opposite, that hailstones are thicker in the valley, and they happen in the spring and autumn, and they are generated in a place nearby. Again, according to the philosopher, sometimes they come at an angle, wich is a sign that they come from nearby: for when they come at an angle they melt more quickly. Hence we should know, that it is natural that one opposite acts more strongly upon the other opposite. It is well known that that in the clouds, heat and cold are mixed; therefore when the heat of the air surrounds and constricts the cold that it cannot consume, then the cold acts inside the heat that surrounds it on the outside.</font>

In nube autem aliquando est aliquid calidum, et istud a frigido exteriori constringitur interius et multiplicatur, ita quod materiam grossam adducit et cadit: et ideo carbones, ignis et grando habent similem generationem, scilicet constrictionem frigoris vel caloris, ut dictum est.

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Falling firebrands have a double cause of generation: one by smoke that rises to the place of inflammation, whihc is inflamed; and thus according to inflammation it descends until it finds combusible material. He touched upon this when he said, coals are lit by it. And here he touches upon another way, which is by contrary resistance. Sometimes in a cloud there is something hot, and this is constrained within by heat outside of it and it is multiplied, so that it draws to itself thick material and falls: and thus coals, fire and hail have a similar generation, namely, the constriction of cold or heat, as was said. He says therefore, at the brightness in his sight etc.. And these pass at the same time as the coal and hail which are generated from the clouds, as was said.</font>

Second, about strokes of lightning, where he says, He sent his arrows.

There are two kinds of sounds in the sky. One is the sound in thunder; and here, although some say it is the extinguishing of fire in a cloud, the psalmist disagrees, and he says that it happens by winds striking together: and the same with clouds. And therefore the psalmist says, The Lord thundered from heaven.</font>

And therefore he says, and the Highest gave his voice, that is, he manifested his power and there follow hail and coals of fire from which these clouds are generated, as was said. Or thus, he thundered from heaven. Not that sometimes a humid vapor rises to a higher place: and because it is of the nature of water, from this come the impressions of water, which are cloud, frost, darkness, rains, hail, snow and the like.</font>

It makes a sound like the sould of the flame in the middle of a blaze. Sometimes as well it is without being set on fire, and consequently there is a sound of tumult without any flashing; and this happens when it strikes in the sides of the cloud but has not been set aflame. If it strikes the sides and breaks them, but only with some difficulty, and this is the thicker part of the cloud, then there is a terrible sound, as if a piece of cloth of immense width was being torn, and then visible thunder or flash is curved: because it does not come straight out of the cloud, as was said.</font>

Fountains are generated in two ways. Sometimes they are generated by the usual and natural cause: just as when vapors are raised above the earth, and they are made cold from being raised to a higher place, and they fall and become rain: so also from the heat within the earth, when vapors do not come out, they are gathered together and resolve into water, and they become fountains of water. Just as rains are generated in the air, so fountains in the water; and so fountains appear around mountains from which vapors do not come out.</font>

Second, sacramental species, such as baptism and other sacraments, in which the divine power works secretly. Third, he was hidden in the faith of the believers: 2 Cor. 5: As long as we are in the body, we are away from the Lord.</font>

Aliud est quando totaliter recedit: unde dicit, claudicaverunt a semitis suis, quasi uno pede debiles, vetus testamentum male servantes, et novum respuentes. Vel si referatur ad Christum, filii alieni mentiti sunt mihi, quia pepigerunt pactum cum Deo: Exo. 24: omnia quaecumque locutus est Deus, faciemus; postea fregerunt: Ps. 65: Mentientur tibi in multitudine virtutis tuae inimici tui.</font>

A thing fades away or grows old because of destruction. They had been new from thebeginning. 1 Paral. 12, when they said: <i>We are yours, o David, and the sons of Jesse with you;</i> but gradually they became lukewarm. It is another thing when someone totally backs off; hence he says, <i>they have halted from their paths</i> , as if weak in one foot, keeping the Old Testament badly, and spitting out the New Testament. Or, if this refers to Christ, <i>the sons who are strangers have lied to me</i> , because they made a pact with God: Exo. 24: <i>Whatever God says, we will do</i> ; but afterwards they broke the pact: Ps. 65: <i>In your great strength, your enemies have lied to you.</i></font>

Again, literally, <i>they have halted</i> , because they followed only the traditions of the pharisees: 1 Kings 18: <i>How long will you halt in two directions?

Again, a blessing is something that one wishes for others, but God is blessing itself, <i>Blessed my God</i> . The son is called my God: Is. 9: <i>A son is given to us</i> . Ps. 66: <i>May God bless us, our God, may God bless us</i> : Dan. 3: <i>You are blessed, Lord God of our fathers, and praiseworthy and blessed forever</i> : and because he fills us with blessings.</font>

Or, of the king, that is, of Christ, through whose name all are saved: Act. 4: <i>There is no other name given etc..</i> Regarding the person he says, <i>and showing mercy to his Christ, David, and to his seed in eternity</i> , because he has multiplied his seed as he promised.</font>
