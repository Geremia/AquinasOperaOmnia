      sciendum, quod de cognitione Dei dupliciter loqui possumus, scilicet 
      secundum se, vel quod nos. Si primo modo, sic procul dubio non potest 
      cogitari non esse: nulla enim propositio potest cogitari falsa ex sua 
      natura, cuius praedicatum includitur in definitione subiecti. Notandum est 
      autem, quod in Deo est aliter esse quam in aliis, quia esse Dei est eius 
      substantia. Ergo qui dicit Deum secundum se, dicit ipsum esse: et ideo 
      secundum se non potest cogitari non esse, et verbum Damasceni solvitur: 
      quia quod naturaliter insertum est, indeterminate scitur, scilicet quod 
      Deus sit, sed non idem, quod Deus, sed per fidem habetur: Deus dicitur a 
      theos quod est ardere omnem malitiam. Tunc ergo dicit aliquis, quod non 
      est Deus, quando cogitat quod non est omnipotens: et quod non habet curam 
      rerum humanarum: <I>Iob 21. Quis est omnipotens ut serviamus ei? 
      </I>Potest referri ad Iudaeos dicentes Christum hominem purum esse, non 
      Deum: <I>Io. 10. Tu homo cum sis, facis teipsum Deum.</I> Qui Iudaei, non 
      credentes ipsum qui promissus erat in lege, dicunt, <B>Non est Deus,</B> 
      iste scilicet qui nobis praedicat. Et hoc dixit, <B>Insipiens,</B> quia 
      Dei sapientiam recipere noluerunt habentes oculos mentis excaecatos: 
      <I>Ps. 81. Nescierunt neque intellexerunt: Sap. 2. Excaecavit enim eos 
      malitia eorum. </I>Vel hic reprehenditur peccator. Primo de peccato cordis

      abominabiles. </B>Primo vocat peccatorem insipientem, quia sapientiam non 
      habet, ut dicit etc. Item quia non sapiunt ei spiritualia: <I>1 Cor. 2. 
      Animalis homo non percipit quae Dei sunt. </I>Consequenter ponitur 
      processus malitiae, <B>Corrupti sunt et abominabiles.</B> Sicut duae 
      partes iustitiae sunt facere bonum, et vitare malum, sic iniustitiae duae 
      partes sunt, facere malum, et vitare bonum. Et primo ponit primam partem. 
      Secundo secundam. Circa primam duo ponit. Primo perversitatem vitiorum. 
      Secundo abominationem eorum. In corporibus sequitur corruptio per 
      exhalationem naturalis caloris expulsi ab extraneo calore: calor namque 
      naturalis animae est amor Dei. Quando ergo subintrat extraneus amor 
      concupiscentiae, et aliorum peccatorum, recedit Deus. Et ideo cum dixit, 
      <B>Non est Deus,</B> statim subdit, <B>Corrupti sunt: </B><I>Hier. 5. 
      Negaverunt Deum, et dixerunt non est ipse, </I>scilicet peccatorum 
      damnator, iustorum remunerator: <I>Eccl. 21. Cor fatui, </I>scilicet 
      peccatoris, <I>quasi vas confractum,</I> <B>Corrupti</B> ergo <B>sunt, 
      </B>peccatores per malum actum: <I>Io. 3. Erant autem eorum mala 
      opera:</I> quia postquam per consensum amittunt bona gratuita, 
      corrumpuntur in eis naturalia; et ideo sequitur eos poena: <I>Ps. 96. 
      Ignis ante ipsum praecedet, et inflammabit in circuitu inimicos eius. 
      </I>Item quando corpus putrescit, redditur abominabile. Sic anima hominis 
      quamdiu amor Dei est in ea, est Deo accepta; sed quando corrumpitur per 
      peccatum, fit abominabilis. Abominabile est, quod humanus appetitus 
      refugit: et ideo dicit, <B>Et abominabiles facti sunt,</B> scilicet Deo et 
      hominibus peccatores per consuetudinem peccandi: <I>Hier. 2 Quam vilis 
      facta es nimis, iterans vias tuas? Osee 9. Alienati sunt in confusione, et 
      facti sunt abominabiles, sicut ea quae dilexerunt. </I>Et dixit, <B>In 
      studiis,</B> quia per ea deveniunt abominabilia. Vel studiose faciunt 
      secundum Hieronymum. Plus enim abominatur Deus studosam voluntatem 
      peccandi, quam ipsum peccatum: <I>Iob 34. Quasi de industria recesserunt 
      ab eo: et vias eius intelligere noluerunt. </I>Alia litera habet, 
      <B>Corrumpunt et abominati sunt studium,</B> scilicet sapientiae et 
      disciplinae: <I>Prov. 1. Exosam habuerunt disciplinam, et timorem Domini 
      non susceperunt: Ezec. 8. Adhuc videbis abominationes maiores. 
      </I>Consequenter agit de vitatione boni, <B>Non est qui faciat bonum,</B> 
      quia non est iustus in terra qui faciat bonum, et non peccet, <I>Eccl. 7. 
      Usque ad unum, </I>idest Christum, quia ipse solus nec peccatum contractum 
      habuit, nec commissum. Beata Virgo habuit contractum peccatum: <I>Eccl. 7. 
      Virum de mille unum reperi, mulierem ex omnibus non inveni. </I>Vel, 
      <B>Usque ad unum,</B> quia nec unus est qui perfecte faciat bonum. Verum 
      est, supposito quod dixerunt, <B>Non est Deus, Et corrupti 
    sunt.</B></FONT></TD>

      ;>Nevertheless, one should know that we can speak of the conception of God 
      in two ways. That is, according to himself, or with respect to ourselves. 
      If it is in the first manner, there is thus no doubt that he cannot be 
      conceived of as not existing. Indeed, no proposition whose predicate is 
      included in the definition of the subject can be conceived of as false by 
      its own nature. It must be noted, however, that existence in the case of 
      God is of a different order than it is with others, since the being of God 
      is his substance. Therefore, anyone who speaks of God according to himself 
      speaks of being itself. Hence, with respect to himself he cannot be 
      conceived of as not existing. And this is solved by the discourse of 
      Damascene. For what is naturally implanted is indeterminately known, 
      namely that God exists. But this is not the same thing as knowing what God 
      is, since that is only grasped by faith. God is called 'a theos,' which is 
      the burning of all malice. Someone says that there is no God at that time 
      when he thinks that he is not omnipotent, and that he has no concern for 
      human affairs; Job 21:15, <I>Who is the Almighty, that we should serve 
      him? </I>This can refer to the Jews who say that Christ is merely human, 
      and not God; Jn 10:33, <I>because that thou, being a man, makest thyself 
      God</I>. And so the Jews, not believing that he was the one promised in 
      the law, declare, <B>There is no God</B>, namely this one who is preaching 
      to us. And on this account he said, <B>The fool</B>, for as the eyes of 
      their mind are blind they did not want to accept the wisdom of God; Ps 
      81:5, <I>They have not known nor understood</I>. And Wis 2:21, <I>for 
      their own malice blinded them</I>. Or perhaps the sinner is rebuked here. 
      First, concerning the sin of his heart in consent, therein, <B>The fool 
      hath said</B>. Second, with respect to sinful deeds, therein, <B>They are 
      corrupt</B>. Third, regarding the sinful habits, therein, <B>And are 
      become abominable</B>. First of all, he calls the sinner a fool, because 
      he does not possess wisdom, as he says etc. Likewise, because they do not 
      understand spiritual things; 1 Cor 2:14, <I>The sensual man perceiveth not 
      these things that are of the Spirit of God</I>. Consequently, he sets 
      forth the manner in which their malice proceeds: <B>They are corrupt and 
      are become abominable</B>. Just as the two aspects of righteousness are 
      doing good and abolishing evil, so the two aspects of unrighteousness are 
      doing evil and abolishing goodness. He considers the primary aspect first; 
      and the secondary aspect follows. With regard to the first aspect he 
      establishes two points: first of all, the baseness of vices, and secondly, 
      their abomination. In bodies corruption results from the exhalation of the 
      natural heat expelled by extraneous heat. For indeed, the natural heat of 
      the soul is the love of God. So it is that whenever the extraneous love of 
      concupiscence, or that of other sins, enters in, it turns away from God. 
      Therefore, when he says, <B>There is no God</B>, he immediately adds, 
      <B>They are corrupt</B>; Jer 5:12, <I>They have denied the Lord, and said, 
      It is not he</I>. That is, the one who condemns sinners and rewards the 
      righteous; Sir 21:17, <I>The heart of a fool,</I> namely of a sinner,<I> 
      is like a broken vessel</I>. Therefore, it is through their evil actions 
      that sinners <B>are corrupt</B>. Jn 3:19 states, <I>their works were 
      evil</I>, because after they had consented to discard the freely given 
      good things, their natural capacities were then corrupted within them. 
      This is why punishment follows them; Ps 96:3, <I>A fire shall go before 
      him, and shall burn his enemies round bout</I>. Likewise, when a body rots 
      it is rendered abominable. So it is that as long as the love of God abides 
      in a man's soul he is acceptable to God. But when he is corrupted by sin 
      he becomes abominable, for it is abominable that the human appetites 
      strive to avoid him. Therefore, he says, <B>They are become 
      abominable</B>. That is to say, sinners become abominable to God and men 
      through their habit of sinning; Jer 2:36, <I>How exceeding base art thou 
      become, going the same ways over again! </I>And Hos 9:10, <I>They 
      alienated themselves to that confusion, and become abominable, as those 
      things were, which they loved</I>. And he said, <B>in their ways</B>, 
      because it is through these things that they became abominable. Or rather, 
      they eagerly carried them out, according to Jerome. Surely God abhors the 
      will that sins eagerly even more than he abhors sin itself; Job 34:27, 
      <I>Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him, and would not 
      understand all his ways. </I>Another text reads: <B>They corrupted and 
      abhorred their endeavor</B>, namely that of wisdom and instruction; Prov 
      1:29, <I>They have hated instruction, and received not the fear of the 
      Lord</I>; and Ezek 8:6, <I>Thou shalt see greater abominations</I>. 
      Consequently, he discusses that abolition of the good: <B>There is none 
      that doth good</B>. Eccl 7:21 says, <I>For there is no just man upon 
      earth, that doth good, and sinneth not</I>. <B>Even one</B>, for that is 
      Christ, since he alone had neither contracted sin, nor committed sin. The 
      Blessed Virgin had contracted sin. Eccl 7:29 says, <I>One man among a 
      thousand I have found, a woman among them all I have not found.</I> Or 
      rather, <B>Even one</B>, because there is not one person who would do the 
      good perfectly. The supposition which they have stated is true: <B>There 
      is no God, And they are corrupt</B>.</FONT></TD></TR>

      says, <I>all the ways of a man are open to his eyes</I>. By the sending of 
      his own Son, therefore, the Lord Father looks down from heaven, that is 
      from the inmost part of his compassion; Is 66:1, <I>Heaven is my 
      throne</I>. Or, <B>from heaven </B>may even<B> </B>refer to Christ, 
      through whom he will judge sinners. Or perhaps it can be understood in yet 
      another way. Now there are some who argue that God does not discern 
      singular and mutable things, because he is immaterial, simple and eternal. 
      And thus he does not discern in accordance with the movements of things, 
      and in accordance with the manner of his own perceptibility. Yet I respond 
      that, on the contrary, God does indeed discern material things, though he 
      does so in an immaterial fashion, as Dionysius has concluded. Furthermore, 
      he discerns intellects, and thus says, <B>from heaven</B>. That is to say, 
      from the sublimity of his own dignity and nature. <B>He hath looked down 
      upon the children of men</B>. For by means of the preceding will through 
      which he desires that all people would be saved, he wishes to discover in 
      us that which pertains to salvation, specifically that we would perceive 
      him through our intellect, love him through our affections, and earnestly 
      long for him. This is why he says, <B>So that he would see</B>. That is, 
      to make us see, since he always sees. <B>If there be any that 
      understands</B>, through the intellect; Deut. 32:29, <I>O that they would 
      be wise and would understand etc. </I><B>And seek God</B>, in their 
      affections. What will he find when he has searched here? The very 
      opposite, because <B>they are all gone aside</B>. And so he establishes 
      three points: that they have turned away from God, that their actions are 
      unprofitable, and that they have refrained from doing the good. Therefore, 
      he says, <B>they are all gone aside</B>. That is to say, from God; Deut 
      31:29, <I>For I know that after my death you will do wickedly and will 
      quickly to turn aside from that I have commanded you</I>; and Hos 4:1, 
      <I>For there is no truth, and there is no mercy, and there is no knowledge 
      of God in the land</I>; and Jer 8:6, <I>No man speaketh what is good, 
      there is none that doth penance for his sin</I>. Likewise, someone who 
      turns away from God in this manner produces what is unprofitable, because 
      something is unprofitable when it does not attain the goal for which it 
      was made. Man, however, was made for the purpose of enjoying God; Wis 4:3, 
      <I>But the multiplied brood of the wicked shall not be profitable</I>. 
      Whereupon he says, <B>They are become unprofitable</B>. Likewise, they 
      refrain from what is good, because, <B>there is none that doth good 
      etc</B>. This has already been explained.</FONT></TD></TR>

      ;><B>Sepulcher</B>. Jerome states that the Apostle employs the testimony 
      of these verses, <B>open sepulcher etc</B>. And it is found elsewhere in 
      Holy Scripture. It is in Rom 3 where he says that he takes one part from 
      Is 59, and another from parts of the Psalter. And not only from this 
      Psalm, since he is himself a Hebrew, and thus would know that this is not 
      contained within the Hebrew text. Nevertheless, it is found in the Vulgate 
      edition which most people use, or that which is not definitively 
      attributed to a particular person. Now a stench is exhaled from an open 
      sepulcher; so the Psalmist verified their malice above, or the guilt of 
      his enemies. Here, however, he explains it. And in connection with this he 
      does two things. First, he demonstrates how sinners are unprofitable to 
      others. Second, how they are unprofitable to themselves, therein, 
      <B>Destruction and unhappiness</B>. Concerning the first point he proposes 
      two aspects. First of all, the way in which they harm others with their 
      speech. Second, how they do so by their actions, therein, <B>Swift [feet] 
      etc.</B> With respect to the first he does two things. First, he states 
      the willingness of their mouth to do harm. Second, the means of doing 
      harm, therein, <B>With their tongues they acted deceitfully</B>. 
      Therefore, he says, <B>Their throat is an open sepulcher</B>. Such a thing 
      as this is prepared for nothing except the reception of a corpse. And in 
      this way the mouth of a person who is always prepared to destroy someone 
      with slander is an open sepulcher; Rev 9:17, <I>and from their mouths 
      proceeded fire and smoke and brimstone</I>. Or if you prefer, one may 
      consider their voraciousness, since the throat also serves to consume. But 
      there are some times when they do harm through deceitfulness, some times 
      when through malice, and still some other times through injury. And so he 
      first considers the deceitfulness which they have on their tongue. 
      <B>Their tongues</B>, by speaking outwardly in flattering tones; Jer 9:8, 
      <I>Their tongue is a piercing arrow, it hath spoken deceit</I>. Second, 
      there abides deceitfulness in their heart, <B>The poison of asps is under 
      their lips</B>. Now hidden poison is deadly, but the poison of asps is 
      even incurable, and incantations are ineffective; Ps 57:5, <I>Like the 
      deaf asp that stoppeth her ears etc.</I>, and whose poison kills by 
      putting one to sleep. Jer 5:26 says, <I>For among my people are found 
      wicked men that lie in wait as fowlers, setting snares and traps to catch 
      men</I>, and again: <I>As a net is full of birds, so their houses are full 
      of deceit</I> (Jer 5:27). For they lure the birds into their traps with 
      pleasant sounds. In this way their cruelty, obstinance and malice is 
      denoted: cruelty, because they endeavor to kill; obstinance, because 
      hatred always abides in their hearts; and thus he says, 
      <B>Poison.</B></FONT></TD></TR>

      ;><B>Destruction</B>. In this place he demonstrates the way in which they 
      have done harm to themselves. Someone harms himself in a two ways: by 
      destroying the good that he has, and by falling away from what he hopes 
      for. He says, therefore, <B>Destruction is in their ways</B>, because they 
      destroy the good which they have; <B>and unhappiness</B>, since they do 
      not attain the good they had hoped for, namely happiness. Is 59:7-8 says, 
      <I>Wasting and destruction are in their ways. They have not known the way 
      of peace, and their is no judgment in their steps</I>. Or even, 
      <B>destruction<I> </B></I>in this world, and <B>unhappiness </B>after 
      death, which is the very opposite of happiness; Job 21:30, <I>Because the 
      wicked man is reserved to the day of destruction, and he shall be brought 
      to the day of wrath</I>. This arises together with what is opposed to love 
      of one's neighbor, because <B>the way of peace they have not known</B>, 
      namely its true nature. Or perhaps, <B>the way of peace they have not 
      known</B> refers to Christ, since his ways are the ways of peace; Prov 
      3:17, <I>Her ways are beautiful ways, and all her paths are peaceable. 
      </I><B>They have not known</B>, because by sinning they have killed Christ 
      himself. For another way is contrary to the love of God; whereupon he 
      says, <B>There is no fear of God before their eyes</B>. On this account 
      they sin, because, as it is said in Prov 16:6, <I>By the fear of the Lord 
      men depart from evil</I>. And since they do not have this fear they are an 
      open sepulcher. </FONT></TD></TR>

      ;><B>Shall not. </B>Here he discusses his hope of liberation. And he first 
      demonstrates that the wicked have no hope, because <B>Shall not they 
      know</B>. Second, he demonstrates what sort of hope this would be, 
      therein, <B>Who shall give out of Zion</B>. With respect to the first he 
      does two things. First of all, he demonstrates that they do not know hope. 
      Second, he stipulates a sign, therein, <B>The counsel of the poor man</B>. 
      First, he produces the question, and then he interposes the guilt of the 
      wicked found within themselves. He speaks in the following way: 'I say 
      that they are an open sepulcher, and that there is no God in their heart;' 
      But shall they not know that the Lord is in the just generation? It is as 
      if he were to say, 'they ought to know this and, moreover, that the Lord 
      abides within it.' For Jer 14:9 states, <I>But thou, O Lord, art among us, 
      and thy name etc.</I>; and Ps 21:4, <I>But thou dwellest in the holy 
      place, the praise of Israel</I>. The Lord, therefore, abides within it, 
      just as in the temple. <B>All that work iniquity</B>. That is to say, 
      insofar as it concerns God. <B>Who devour my people as they eat bread</B>, 
      insofar as it concerns their neighbors whom they devour by taking away 
      their goods; Zech 11:9, <I>Let the rest devour every one the flesh of his 
      neighbor</I>; and Mic 3:3, <I>Who have eaten the flesh of my people, and 
      have flayed their skin from off them</I>; and Sir 34:25, <I>The bread of 
      the needy is the life of the poor; whoever defraudeth them thereof is a 
      man of blood.</I> <B>They have not called upon God</B>. That is to say, 
      they have no hope in God; Is 59:13, <I>We went not after our God</I>. And 
      it follows from this that they have no security; therefore, he says, 
      <B>They trembled for fear etc</B>. Prov 28:1 states, <I>The wicked man 
      fleeth, when no man pursueth</I>; and Job 15:21, <I>The sound of dread is 
      always in his ears, and when there is peace, he always suspecteth 
      treason</I>. But the one who calls upon God is saved; Joel 2:32, 
      <I>Everyone that shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved</I>; 
      and Prov 18:10, <I>The name of the Lord is a strong tower</I>. Therefore, 
      such people do not know, precisely because <B>the Lord is in the just 
      generation</B>. And he demonstrates through a sign that this is not such a 
      generation, because <B>you have confounded the counsel of the poor 
      man</B>. That is to say, you reckoned him as one capable of being 
      confused, and you blasphemed as far as it is in you. And yet this is the 
      counsel of the poor man, that he might know <B>the Lord is his hope</B>. 
      Psalm 21:9 says, <I>He hoped in the Lord; let him deliver him, let him 
      save him, seeing that he delighteth in him</I>, as does Matt 27:43. While 
      Matt 19:21 states, <I>And Jesus saith to him, 'If thou wilt be 
      perfect</I>.' But the rich always condemn this counsel; Prov 1:25, <I>You 
      have despised my counsel, and have neglected my reprehensions</I>. And 
      from whence does it come? <B>But the Lord is his hope</B>, for they have 
      nowhere in this world to place their hope except in God, who is the hope 
      of the saints. </FONT></TD></TR>
