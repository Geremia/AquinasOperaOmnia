Auribus percipe orationem meam, non in labiis dolosis. De vultu tuo iudicium meum prodeat: oculi tui videant aequitatem. Probasti cor meum, et visitasti nocte: igne me examinasti, et non est inventa in me iniquitas. Ut non loquatur os meum opera hominum: propter verba labiorum tuorum ego custodivi vias duras. Perfice gressus meos in semitis tuis, ut non moveantur vestigia mea.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">The prayer of David. Hear, O Lord, my justice: attend to my supplication. Give ear unto my prayer, (which proceedeth) not from deceitful lips. Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable. Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, thou hast tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me. That my mouth may not speak the words of men: for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways. Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps be not moved.</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><b>a.</b> Supra describit psalmista divinam iustitiam, et ostendit quod eam servabat; hic proponit orationem in qua petit exaudiri, propter iustitiam.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Previously, the Psalmist described divine justice and showed that he observed it. In this psalm, he offers a prayer in which he asks to be heard for the sake of justice.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Titulus, oratio David. Et est primus psalmus qui intitulatur ab oratione, quia huiusmodi totaliter est oratio; et ideo ab oratione incipit, quia inter tribulationes singulare refugium est oratio; Psalm. 108: Pro eo ut me diligerent, detrahebant mihi, ego autem orabam.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Its title is "The Prayer of David", and it is the first psalm entitled with (the word) "prayer" (for the whole of it is a prayer). This psalm arises from prayer because in the midst of tribulations, prayer is an unparalled refuge; Psalm 108: "Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me: but I gave myself to prayer."</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Dividitur ergo psalmus iste in duas partes. In prima orat pro stabilitate propria; in secunda petit liberationem a malo, ibi, <i>ego clamavi.</i> Circa primum duo facit. Primo petit exaudiri; secundo proponit petitionem suam, ibi, <i>de vultu tuo.</i></font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">This psalm, then, is divided into two parts. In the first, he prays for his own endurance. In the second, he asks for deliverance from evil, at <i>I have cried.</i> Concerning the former, he does two things. First, he asks to be heard, and second, sets forth his petition, at <i>From they countenance.</i></font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Considerandum est autem, quod in exauditione sit triplex gradus. Primo ille cui fit petitio, audit verba. Secundo attendit sensum. Tertio implet petitum.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Now, in hearkening (to another), a three-fold approach must be considered. Frist, he to whom the petition is made hears the words, second, he considers (its) meaning, and third, he fulfills what is prayed for.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Primo ergo petit ut exaudiatur, dicens, <i>exaudi</i> etc.; Dan. 9: Exaudi, Domine Deus, orationem servi tui. Secundo in exauditione ponit meritum petentis; et ideo dicit, <i>iustitiam meam:</i> quasi dicat: in me est meritum ut exaudias. Glossa: Iustitia habet vocem apud Deum, qua penetrat caelum: Iac. ult.: Multum valet deprecatio iusti assidua: Ioan. 9: Peccatores Deus non audit: sed si quis Dei cultor est, hunc Deum exaudit.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Accordingly, he asks first that he be heard, saying <i>Hear</i> etc; Daniel 9: "Hear O Lord God the prayer of thy servant". In his hearkening, he next states the merit of the petitioner. Thus, he says <i>My justice.</i> It is as if he were saying, "There is merit in me so that you may hearken (to me)". The Gloss states "Justice has a voice before God, by which (voice) it penetrates the heavens"; James 5: "The continual prayer of a just man availeth much"; John 9: "God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God (and doth His will), him He heareth".</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Secundo petit quod intendat ad sensum orationis, <i>intende deprecationem meam.</i> Glossa dicit: Deprecationem, quae est pro malis amovendis. Alia littera, Intende ad canticos meos, quasi ad spiritualem intellectum: Ps. 129: Fiant aures tuae intendentes in vocem deprecationis meae.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">(With respect to the) second (step), he asks that he strive after the meaning of his prayer, <i>Attend to my supplication.</i> The Gloss says "Supplication, which is for removing evils." Another version has "Attend to my songs", to (my) spiritual understanding, as it were; Psalm 129: "Let thy ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication".</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Tertio quod audiat verba orantis; et ideo dicit, <i>auribus percipe orationem,</i> quae est, <i>non in labiis dolosis,</i> sed simplicibus: Isa. 53: Dolus non fuit in ore eius.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">(And as for the) third (step, he asks) that He listen to the words of (his) praying. And so, he says <i>Give ear unto my prayer</i> which is <i>not from deceitful lips</i> but from sincere ones; Isaiah 53: "There was no deceit in his mouth".</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Sed cum omnia audiat, quare dicitur quaedam audire, et quaedam non? Sap. 1: Spiritus sanctus disciplinae effugiet fictum, et auferet se a cogitationibus quae sunt sine intellectu.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">But since He hears all things, why does He hear one prayer, but not another? Wisdom 1: "The Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful, and will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding."</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Deus non dicitur audire nisi verba vera, et non quae proveniunt ex labiis dolosis: et ideo dicit, <i>non in labiis dolosis.</i> Ps. 11: Labia dolosa in corde etc. Et sic dolosum dupliciter accipitur: scilicet fictio respectu oris, et respectu operis, cum opus non concordat ori. Pharisaeus qui dicebat, Luc. 18: non sum sicut caeteri hominum etc. non fuit exauditus; sed alius qui <i>non in labiis dolosis,</i> sed recte orabat, fuit exauditus, quia descendit iustificatus in domum suam. Glossa: Labia dolosa sunt qui dicunt Domine Domine, et non faciunt voluntatem Patris mei.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">(In response to this I say that) God is not said to listen except to true words, and not to those which come from deceitful lips; and so he says <i>not with decietful lips.</i> Psalm 11: "(with) deceitful lips (and) with a (double) heart (they have spoken)". "Deceitful" is thus taken in a two-fold way, namely, as insincerity with respect to mouth and deed when the latter does not agree with the former. The Pharisee who said "I am not as the rest of men" (Luke 18), was not heard, but the other man (the publican) who prayed <i>not with deceitful lips,</i> but uprightly, was heard because "he went down into his house justified" (Luke 18). The Gloss has "Deceitful lips are those which say 'Lord, Lord', and do not do the will of my Father".</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>De vultu tuo.</i> Iudex non profert sententiam nisi audita petitione et discussa causa. Et ideo hic petitionem ponit: et petit tria. Primo sententiam. Secundo causae examinationem, ibi, <i>Probasti.</i> Tertio sententiae qualitatem, <i>Perfice.</i> Circa primum duo facit. Primo petit iudicium. Secundo temperamentum, ibi, <i>Oculi tui.</i></font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>From they countenance.</i> A judge does not deliver (his) sentence unless he has heard the petition and has considered the affair. For this reason, he makes his petition at this point. He asks for three things. First, a sentence, second, an examination of the affair, at, <i>You have proved,</i> and third, a condition of sentence, at, <i>Perfect.</i> Concerning the first, he does two things. First, he asks for judgment, and second moderation (or "that it be moderate), at, <i>Let thy eyes.</i></font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Dicit ergo, <i>De vultu tuo,</i> idest de cognitione tua: <i>Iudicium meum prodeat,</i> idest pro me: Hier. 10: Corripe me Domine, verumtamen in iudicio, non in furore tuo, ne forte ad nihilum redigas me. Sed hic petit iudicium non severitatis: Isa. 64: Omnes iustitiae vestrae quasi pannus menstruatae, sed aequitatis, secundum quod patitur humana natura: et ideo dicit, <i>Oculi tui videant aequitatem,</i> idest iudicent iudicium aequitatum: Isa. 11: Arguet in aequitate pro mansuetis terrae: Iob. 22: Aequitatem proponat contra me, et ad victoriam proveniet iudicium meum; quasi dicat: non peto iudicium, quia causa mea tibi examinata est. Quod causa sua sit examinata coram eo, ostendit cum dicit, <i>Probasti</i> etc. Et primo ponit ordinem examinationis. Secundo quid sit inventum exponit, <i>et non est inventa.</i></font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Thus he says <i>From the countenance,</i> that is from thy thought, <i>Let my judgment come forth,</i> that is, for my benefit; Jeremiah 10: "Correct me, O Lord, but yet with judgment, and not in thy fury, lest thou bring me to nothing". But here, he asks for a judgment not of severity (Isaiah 64: "All our justices as the rag of a menstruous woman"), but of equity, in so far as human nature permits. Consequently, he says, <i>Let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable,</i> that is, let (them) decide an equitable judgment; Isaiah 11: "He shall reprove with equity for the meek of the earth"; Job 23: "Let him propose equity against me, and let my judgment come to victory." It is as if he were saying "I do not ask for judgment, because my cause has been examined by you." He shows that his cause has been examined in his presence when he says <i>Thou has proved</i> etc. First, he shows the order of examintion, and second, what was discovered, (which latter) he explains at, <i>And iniquity has not been found in me.</i></font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Dicit ergo, <i>Probasti cor meum.</i> Differentia est inter probare et examinare: probare quaerit rationem facti, examinare quaerit ipsum factum. Ratio autem facti magis tangit cor, sed factum magis tangit corpus. Dicit ergo, <i>Probasti cor meum,</i> idest probatum ostendisti, quod non est turbatum propter tribulationes quas patior.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Consequently, he says, <i>Thou hast proved my heart.</i> There is a difference between proving and examining. Proving (in the sense of testing, inspecting, trying) enquires after the reason for what has been done, while examining enquires after the deed itself. The former pertains more to the heart, but the latter more to the body. Thus, he says, <i>Thou hast proved my heart,</i> that is having proved (my heart), you have seen that it has not been disturbed according to the tribulations which I have suffered.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Deus cum examinat, tria facit. Probat, visitat, et examinat. Probat cum diiudicat an habeat cordis rectitudinem: quia si non habet, non curat examinare; sed quando hoc habet, indiget examinari utrum habeat firmitatem: Hier. 17: Ego Dominus scrutans corda et probans renes, qui do unicuique iuxta viam suam. Sed haec examinatio est dura et fortis, ita quod nullus sustineret nisi adiutus ab eo: Iob 6: Quae fortitudo mea ut subsistam et quis finis meus ut patienter agam? nec fortitudo mea nec caro mea aenea est. Et ideo praemittit visitationem: Psalm. 88: Visitabo in virga, vel adiuvando, vel corrigendo.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">When God examines, He does three things, namely, he proves, visits, and examines. He proves when he discerns whether an individual has rectitude of heart. For if he does not (have this rectitude), then he does not trouble himself to examine (him). But when (an individual) has this (rectitude), he will need to be examined (to see) whether he has constancy; Jeremiah 17: "I am the Lord who search the heart and prove the reins: who give to every one according to his way". But this examination is severe and powerful, so much so that no one would withstand it unless helped by Him; Job 6: "For what is my strength that I can hold out? or what is my end that I should keep patience? My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my flesh of brass (Neither my strength or my flesh is of brass)". And so, he goes forward in visitation; Psalm 88: "I will visit with a rod", either helping or correcting.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>Visitasti nocte.</i> Sed potest idem intelligi per noctem et ignem, quia turbat animam: Iob 30: Nocte os meum perforatur doloribus: et incendium facit hoc idem.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>Thou hast visited (my heart) by night.</i> (This visitation) can be understood by "night" and "fire" because (either) disturbs the soul; Job 30: "In the night my bone is pierced with sorrows...and fire does the same".</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Vel <i>nocte,</i> idest defectu spiritualis intelligentiae. Quandoque quis habet rectum cor, et supervenit sibi tentatio et negligentia; et haec est in nocte: et in hac visitat Dominus adiuvando contra tentationes, et negligentiam excutit et confortat: Ps. 49: Cum defecerit virtus mea, ne derelinquas me.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>By night</i> (can also be understood as) "in the absence of spiritual understanding". At times, one has an upright heart when temptation and negligence falls upon one and one's heart is in the night. The Lord visits in one's heart by helping (one) against temptations, driving away negligence, and comforting (one); Psalm 49: "When my power fails, do not abandon me".</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Vel <i>nocte,</i> idest quiete et silentio, et tunc visitat per consolationes: Matth. 25: Media nocte clamor factus est, ecce sponsus venit.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>By night</i> (can also be understood as) "in quiet and silence", and (in this situation) he visits through consolations; Matthew 25: "And at midnight there was a cry made: Behold the bridegroom cometh".</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>Examinasti igne,</i> idest tribulatione; quia tunc apparet si est bonus amicus, et non recedit: Eccl. 6: Est amicus secundum tempus suum, et non permanebit in die tribulationis. Invenitur autem per istam examinationem innocentia et perfectio, quia examinat si in eo inveniatur innocentia. Hoc autem in isto invenitur. Et primo ponit eius innocentiam. Secundo perfectionem, ibi, <i>Non est inventa in me iniquitas.</i></font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>Thou hast tried me by fire,</i> that is, by tribulation, because it is then apparent if he is a good friend and does not withdraw; Ecclesiasticus 6: "There is a friend for his own occasion, and he will...abide in the day of thy trouble". Innocence and perfection are discovered by this very examination since it examines if innocence is to be found in him, and indeed it is found in him. He first sets out his innocence, and second, his perfection, at, <i>And iniquity hath not been found in me.</i></font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Sed contra. 1 Ioan. 1: Si dixerimus quia peccatum non habemus, nosipsos seducimus, et veritas in nobis non est: Et Prov. 20: Quis potest dicere, mundum est cor meum? Eccl. 7: Non est homo iustus in terra qui faciat bonum et non peccet. Glossa, nec infans unius diei.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">But on the contrary there is 1 John 1: "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us", and Proverbs 20: "Who can say: My heart is clean (I am pure from sin?", and Ecclesiastes 7: "(For) there is no just man upon earth that doth good and sinneth not". The Gloss adds "Nor an infant of one day".</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Dicendum, quod loquitur de iniquitate peccati per quam in tribulatione recedit a Deo. Perfectio innocentiae invenitur in eo, intantum quod non loquitur <i>Opera hominum,</i> idest peccatum; quasi dicat: non solum in corde, sed nec in ore eius est iniquitas: Iob. 6: Non invenietis in lingua mea iniquitatem, nec in faucibus meis iniquitas personabit: Eph. 4: Omnis sermo malus de ore vestro non procedat.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">(I respond) by saying that he speaks concerning the iniquity of sin through which one withdraws from God in tribulation. The perfection of innocence is found in him in so far as he does not speak <i>The works of men,</i> that is, sin. It is as if he were saying "Iniquity is not only not in his heart, but also not in his mouth"; Job 6: "You shall not find iniquity on my tongue, neither shall folly sound in my mouth"; Ephesians 4: "Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth".</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Vel sic: <i>Non est inventa in me iniquitas, ut non loquatur os meum,</i> cum post sequitur, <i>opera hominum</i> etc.: quasi dicat, tu vidisti quod in me non est iniquitas: et hoc, quia non decet me loqui, tu tamen vidisti hoc. Prov. 27: Laudet te alienus, et non os tuum: extraneus, et non labia tua.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Or (it could be interpreted) in this way: <i>...and iniquity hath not been found in me. That my mouth may not speak,</i> when after follows <i>The works of men,</i> as if to say "You yourself have seen that there is no iniquity in me; and this is so because it is not proper for me to speak (of such); but you yourself have seen this"; Proverbs 27: "Let another praise thee, and not thy own mouth: a stranger, and not thy own lips".</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Jerome has "You have proved and you have not found my thoughts to ascend beyond my mouth", as if to say, "Confusion does not proceed so far that it comes from the heart to the mouth by murmurings".</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Next, he sets forth by what fire the examination was made, when he says, <i>For the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.</i> The hard ways are adversities, and I have sustained this <i>for the sake of the words of thy lips,</i> so that I might serve, or announce, your words; Jeremiah 22: "The word of the Lord was done in opprobrium and in derision".</font>

Again, a hen protects her chicks in her wings against a bird of prey, just as God defends the just from the rapacity of the demons in His Wings, which are charity and mercy; Matthew 23: "How often would I have gathered together thy children, as the hen doth gather her chickens under her wings, and thou wouldest not?" Therefore, in (his) wings, God raises up to the heavens; Psalm 88: "Mercy and truth shall go before thy face: blessed is the people (that knoweth jubiliation); Jeremiah 31: "I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore have I drawn thee, taking pity on thee."</font>

(It is understood in the former) in as much as it signifies a devotion of the mind; Psalm 62: "Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness." (It is understood) in a bad way, first as it signifies wickedness of heart, second, of the mouth, and third of (one's) works: and in this fashion (fat) designates detestable wickedness; Job 21: "His bowels are full of fat, and his bones are moistened with marrow. And this is manifold. Sometimes (there is) pleasure in the sin that they committ; Proverbs 2: "Who are glad when they have done evil, and rejoice in most wicked things." Also, pride and falseness; Job 11: "A vain man is lifted up into pride, and thinketh himself born free like a wild ass's colt." Also, carnal sensuality. Therefore, he says, <i>Their fat,</i> that is, carnal sensuality, either pride or pleasure: <i>They have shut up,</i> in themselves so that they do not take hold of the spiritual meaning.</font>

Et hoc fecerunt Iudaei Christo, quando proiecerunt eum extra civitatem: Luc. 2: <i>Et circumdederunt me,</i> convenientes ad spectaculum ut irriderent, Act. 7.

And he first shows how (the wicked) proceed to (their) work, and second, its cause, at, <i>Their eyes.</i> In (their) activity, he sets down two things. First, a defect, and second, the solicitude to injure. However, when one despises, one is not solicitous to do harm: and so he says <i>Those who cast (me) forth,</i> that is, those who despise (me); Isaiah 33: "He hath rejected the cities, he hath not regarded the men (and yet they have surrounded me on all sides carefully with solicitude"). And this the Jews did to Christ when they ejected him from the city; cf. Luke 2. <i>And they have surrounded me,</i> those comming to the spectacle so that they might mock (him); cf. Acts 7. The reason for this is that they care not for God, but rather for earthly things; Psalm 3: "There is no salvation for him in his God."</font>

And with respect to this, he says, <i>Deliver my soul from the wicked one</i> because he persecutes me contrary to justice, and is thus wicked; Psalm 42: "Deliver me from the unjust and deceitful man." The reason for this is that my soul is a spear, that is a <i>sword</i> sharpened on both sides by which the devil was destroyed.
