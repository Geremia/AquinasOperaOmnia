        THOMAS AQUINAS<br />
        COMMENTARY ON PSALM 9-19
      </h2>
      <p><b>translated by F.F. Reilly</b></p>
    </center>

    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
    <p>
      In Psalm 8 the psalmist rendered thanks to God for granting divine
      blessings to the entire human race. Here in Psalm 9, thanks is especially
      rendered to God for blessings to the psalmist. This idea, according to
      Jerome, is evident from the title of Psalm 9: "To the choirmaster;
      according to Muth-labben. A Psalm of David."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Second Book of Samuel (chapters: 18-19) records that David, after his
      son Absalom's death, recovered his kingdom. Due to this particular
      blessing, David composed Psalm 9.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our version (used by St. Thomas), the title of Psalm 9 is: "Thanks for
      the Victory over the Heathen," This seems to be an obscure title regarding
      things about Absalom's death, that are hidden from everyone's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mystically the title for Psalm 9 can refer to Christ (Son of God). For,
      Christ is called a "Son," as of God, the Father. Because: "So if the Son
      makes you free, you will be free indeed." (Jo 8:36), So, David's mystical
      son is promised in return. As recorded: "And he cried, 'Jesus, son of
      David, have mercy on me'" (Lk 18:38).
    </p>
    <p>
      So, hidden things of a son are as mysteries concerning Christ. For such
      hidden things of Christ are twofold, Christ's first coming on earth is
      hidden in reference to his divinity and glory, Both these two things are
      hidden within a weakness of human flesh. For: "Truly thou art a God who
      hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Savior" (Is 45:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ's second coming upon this earth will be evident. Because: "And then
      they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory"
      (Luke 21:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ's judgment is also twofold. One is hidden within the very condition
      of this present world. Another judgment is from God, the Father, allowing
      good persons to suffer from evil persons, For: "Thy righteousness is like
      the mountain of God, thy judgments are like the great deep." (Ps 36
      [35]:6). Also: "Therefore do not pronounce judgment before thy time,
      before the Lord comes" (1 Cor 4:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in Psalm 9 there is exposed a hidden judgment that good persons suffer
      from evil persons. Because: "But when I looked for good, evil came, and I
      waited for light, darkness came" (Job 30:26).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the entire Psalm 9 is exposed along the above consideration of
      thanks, and freedom from enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psalm 9 is divided into two parts, The first part considers actions from
      divine blessings. The second part considers the matters concerning such
      blessings, There: "When my enemies turned back, they stumbled and perished
      before thee," (Verse 3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Divine blessings are threefold: from the mouth, the heart, and the deed.
      The blessings from the mouth are twofold: from praising and preaching. By
      praising when it says: "I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole
      heart" (Verse 1). And by preaching, from three ideas: faith, sinners, and
      praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regards faith is said: "For man believes with his heart, and is so
      justified. He professes with his lips and so is saved." (Rom 10:10). Also:
      "I acknowledged my sin to thee, and I did not hide my iniquity" (Ps 32
      [31]:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regards sinners: "Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for
      one another, that you may be healed" (Jas 5:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regards praise: "Then the angel called the two of them private, and said
      to them: "Praise God and give thanks to him in the presence for what he
      has done for us" (Tob 12:6).
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses l-2</b></p>
    <p>
      Concerning the idea of praising, it is said: "I will give thanks to the
      Lord with my whole heart; I will tell of all thy wonderful deeds." (Verse
      1). Such praises are within the heart. As I Samuel 16:7 claims: "But the
      Lord said to Samuel, "Do not look on his appearance, or on the height of
      his stature, because I have rejected him; for the Lord sees not as men
      sees, but the Lord looks on the heart." On the contrary is stated in
      Isaiah 29:13: "And the Lord said: 'Because this people draw near with
      their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from
      me." And: "As it is written, This people honor me with their lips but
      their heart is far from me" (Mark 7:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      So is said in Verse 1: "With my whole heart." For: "Whenever our hearts
      condemn us, for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything"
      (1 Jo 3:20). Also, insofar as we praise as we can, due to God himself.
      Because: "And you shall love the Lord your God, with all your heart" (Deut
      6:5). Thus, the person who does not give the entire heart, or love, to
      God, but rather desires to possess something else besides, then forfeits
      God." For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on it, and the covering
      too narrow to wrap oneself in it" (Is 28:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      The person then who praises God with their entire heart accepts nothing
      contrary to God. Such a person refers everything to God alone by their
      actions, and habits. For: "It is good to guard the secret of the king; but
      gloriously to reveal the works of God. Do good, and evil will not overtake
      you" (Job 12:7). That is, by professing and praising God's works.
    </p>
    <p>
      So: "I will tell of all thy wonderful deeds." (Verse 1). Namely, by
      preaching and announcing God's works to others. For, God grants
      communicable divine blessings to others. Such will occur by announcing the
      blessings to others. But he sent them away saying, "Return to your home
      and declare how much God has done for you." (Lk 8:38-39). Also: "I will
      tell of all thy wonderful deeds" (Verse 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, there is had, what is said: "wonderful deeds," since God's works are
      wonderful. For: "Thou art the God who workest wonders, who has manifested
      thy might among the peoples" (Ps 77 [76]:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      But why does Verse 1 state: "All"? This is stated generally, either
      because all things whatsoever are narrowed and are thus wonderful. Or,
      because all things need not the intention of narrowing, nor need to
      consist as just one thing. So, a person then can proceed as much as one
      desires. Hilary (Doctor of the Church, died 368 A.D.), claims in his
      writing: "On the Trinity": One who piously proceeds infinitely, still
      never arrives. He merely becomes proficient in proceeding forward. For:
      "When you praise the Lord, exalt him as much as you can, for he will
      surpass even that" (Sir 43:30). Also: "The Lord has not enabled his holy
      ones to recount all his marvellous works, which the Lord Almighty has
      established that the universe may stand in glory" (Sir 42:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "I will be glad and exult in thee, I will sing praise to thy name, O
      Most High" (Verse 2). Here gratitude is rendered from the heart. Some
      narrate to others their blessings and rejoice about them, just as do even
      sinners. For, Luke the Apostle so declares of the Pharisee who claimed:
      "God, I thank thee that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust,
      adulterers or even like this tax collector" (Lk 18:11). Here in Verse 2
      the person will ever rejoice in the Lord, the Most High. "For the Lord is
      the one who repays, he will repay you sevenfold."(Sir 35:11). Thus: "I
      will be glad and exult in thee." (Verse 2). That is, inwardly within my
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again: "And exult in thee" (Verse 2). Namely, even towards external
      gladness. Because: "Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God
      of my salvation" (Hab 3:18). So, I will rejoice in the Lord: "I will sing
      praise to thy name, O Most High." (Verse 2).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also:"I will sing praise." (Verse 2). Here also thanks are considered
      regarding deeds. For to sing a psalm by hand (on the psaltery) is a deed,
      and good psalmody constitutes a good deed. Thus, all good deeds of
      ourselves ought to tend towards God's glory. For: "Let your light shine
      before men that they see your good works and give glory to your Father,
      who is in heaven." (Mt: 5: 16). And: "I will praise the Lord as long as I
      live, I will sing praises to my God while I have being." (Ps 146:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Verse 2 ends: "To thy name, O Most High." Which declares, as it were:
      "God the Most High does not profit from the fact that I, David, praise and
      sing a psalm to you, O Most High." Because: "I prayed with the head bowed
      on my bosom, as though I grieved for my frfend, or my brother" (Ps 35
      [34]:13). Also: "If you are righteousness what do you give to him, or what
      does he receive from your hand? (Job: 35: 7). And: "Is it any pleasure to
      the Almighty if you are righteous, or is it a gain to him if you make your
      ways blameless?" (Job: 22: 3).
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses 3-4</b></p>
    <p>
      Here in Verse 3 the matter for actions of divine blessings is exposed.
      First, especially as to such actions, and then generally. There: "When my
      enemies turned back, they stumbled and perished before thee." (Verse 3).
      Secondly the authority of the one acting is praised. There: "Thou hast sat
      on the throne giving righteous judgment." (Verse 4). Thirdly, an effect is
      noted: "For thou hast maintained my just cause" (Verse 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact of divine blessings for themselves, regards destruction of their
      enemies. About this, three ideas are advanced. First, if one is destroyed,
      that one is defected from their aim. Regarding such there is declared:
      "When my enemies turned back." (Verse 3). And one can add to this idea: "I
      confess." That is, I, David, render thanks to God. Thus, an enemy is
      deflected when departing from the aim he proposes. For: Let them be put to
      shame and confusion who' seek my life" (Ps 70 [69]:2); and (Ps 40 [39]:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      The justice for the fact of actions of divine blessings are considered on
      the part of the judges. Thus, here the authority of judgment of God is
      declared. For: "Thou hast sat on the throne givine righteous judgment."
      (Verse 4). Which is the seat of a judge, having regal power to destroy
      evil. For: "A king who sits on the throne of judgment winnows all evil
      with his eye" (Prov 20:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the judge has a love for justice. So is said: "Giving righteous
      judgment" (Verse 4). Namely: "But, Lord of hosts, who judgest righteously,
      who triest the heart and the mind, let me see thy vengeance upon thee, for
      to thee I have committed my cause" (Jer 11:20). Which claims, as it were:
      Such righteous judgment is proper to thee, O Lord. "For the Lord loves
      righteous deeds, the upright shall behold his face" (Ps 11 [10]:7).
      Because; "It is I am anouncing vindication, mighty to save" (Is 63:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, Verse 4 can refer to Christ. Then it is Christ judging, and Christ,
      the just cause. For: "But you are full of judgment on the wicked, judgment
      and justice seize you" (Job 36:17). Thus, it is Christ's just cause, since
      Christ arrived at his own glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      So: "Thou hast set" (Verse 4). Namely, "God, the Father, hast set on the
      throne" (Verse 4), That is, upon the soul of Christ's divinity, at the
      right of God, the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there is the weakening of the enemy's power. There: "They stumbled"
      (Verse 3). Namely, within their power they stumbled. Because: "But the
      Lord is with me as a dread warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble"
      (Jer 20:11). "There is then the idea that enemies will perish. So is
      declared: "And perished before thee" (Verse 3). That is, either by falling
      into irreverence: "Before thee" Namely, by your awareness and
      condemnation, O Lord. Or: "And perished" (Verse 3) from thy face, O Lord,
      as they were unable to behold you. For: "In the land of uprightness he
      deals perversely and does not see the majesty of the Lord" (Is 26:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Another version for Verse 3 has: "The impious one is taken away, lest he
      behold the glory of God".
    </p>
    <p>
      Then is considered the justice of the actions of divine blessings. First,
      on the Lord's part, as is said: "For thou hast maintained my just cause"
      (Verse 4). For, sometimes, one gains justice while having a judge who
      renders such justice. Othertimes, one may have a judge, yet does not have
      a witness, or an advocate. So is stated: "For thou hast maintained my just
      cause" (Verse 4). That is, you, O Lord, have granted to me, David, a just
      cause, as my own witness. For: "I am the one who knows and am witness,
      says the Lord" (Jer 29:23). God here is both a judge and witness. As
      judge, God renders a verdict; as witness, God, defends just causes.
    </p>
    <p>Other expositions for Verse 4 can be presented, as one desires.</p>
    <p><b>Verses 5-6</b></p>
    <p>
      "Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast
      blotted out their name for ever and ever" (Verse 5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Above, is shown the judgment in David's own interest, as if a verdict is
      owed to him, Here in Verse 5 is shown a just judgment in David's interest
      regarding those avenging. So, justice is first considered; second, such
      justice is then exposed. There: "Thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast
      blotted out their name for ever and ever" (Verse 5).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord punishing the wicked effects three things. First, the Lord does
      not proceed directly to his judgment, since he first reprehends. Second,
      unless the wicked correct themselves, the Lord then punishes. Third, the
      Lord finally exterminates the wicked. Concerning the divine reprehension,
      there is declared: "Thou hast rebuked the nations" (Verse 5). That is,
      through preachers. For: "Cry aloud, spare not, lift up your voice like a
      trumphet, declare to my people their transgression" (Is: 58: 1). Also:
      "Preach the word, be urgent in season and out of season, convince, rebuke
      and exhort, be unfailing in patience and in teaching" (2 Tim 4:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the correcting of the wicked is said: "Thou hast destroyed the
      wicked" (Verse 5). That is, through tribulations. For: "Man is also
      chastened with pain upon his bed and with continual strife in his bones"
      (Job 33:19). Thus is said: "Thou hast destroyed the wicked" (Verse 5).
      That is, this can refer to David's son, Absalom, or the devil himself.
      Because: "Between morning and evening they are destroyed, they perish
      forever without any regarding it" (Job 4:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "Thou hast rebuked the nations" (Verse 5). Namely, those nations
      deceiving thee, O Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, "Thou has destroyed the wicked" (Verse 5), since an entire multitude
      is repulsed. Yet, it is not completely destroyed, since it was seduced. In
      regard to the fact the Lord does punish, there is asserted: "Thou hast
      blotted out their name for ever and ever" (Verse 5). Because the wicked
      ever endeavor to perpetuate themselves, yet they are not to be found
      within eternity. However, the name of Judah, and the Jewish people, is
      held in memory. Yet it must be noted that no people wish their name to be
      magnified within wickedness, but within goodness The name of Judah,
      however, will remain in wickedness. Because: "The memory of the righteous
      is a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot" (Prov. 10: 7). Jerome
      claims that someone, indeed unknown, could burn a temple so as to become
      known. Likewise, the name of the wicked can remain remembered within
      wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then is said in Verse 6:"The enemy have vanished in everlasting ruins;
      their cities thou hast rooted out, the memory of them has perished" (Verse
      6). Here is exposed in what manner an enemy perishes, within two ideas.
      First, there is assigned a reason by which an enemy will perish; second,
      the manner. There: "The enemy have vanished in everlasting ruins, their
      cities thou hast rooted out" (Verse 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason why the enemy will perish is: One will perish as one wishes to
      gain a reputation. Sometimes one makes a name for themselves through their
      military power within wars. Hence is recorded: "These were the mightily
      men that were of old, the men of renown" (Gen: 6: 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Othertimes, a person can achieve a repution through the construction of a
      city. For: "Children and the building of a city establish a man's name,
      but a blameless wife is accounted better than both" (Sir 40: 19.). For
      instance, is the reputation of Romulus, constructor of the city of Rome.
      (Recorded in Roman mythology, as son of the God, Mars, and founder, and
      first king of Rome.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, the Lord God destroys both kinds of such reputations, as above
      stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      So:"The enemy have vanished in everlasting ruins" (Verse 6). That is, as
      if swords of men have finally failed. For: "There he broke the flashing
      arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war" (Ps 76 [75]:4).
      And: "Their cities thou hast rooted out" (Verse 6). For: "Your country
      lies desolate, your cities are burnt with fire" (Is 1:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in Verse 6 the enemy can refer to the devil. As: "He said to them,
      'An enemy has done this" (Mt 13:28). Likewise, short swords can refer to
      temptations, and cities refer to councils by which good persons are
      perverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then is declared: "The very memory of them has perished" (Verse 6). Here
      is considered the manner by which something perishes, which is twofold:
      their memory has perished, and at the same time, their sound. The sound of
      the wicked is made by clashes of rulers who destroy cities. For, all are
      given over to death, to the nether world among mortal men with those who
      go down to the pit" (Ezek 31:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      Or: the sound of "the enemy have vanished" (Verse 6). Namely, as when any
      evil person is destroyed yet not without a great clash of sounds. For, it
      is befitting such a one suffer some clash. For instance, as the Apostle
      Matthew in his Chapter 9 records that the enemy, the devil, goes out of
      someone shouting and clashing, and tearing himself to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome literally states for Verse 6: "Their memory perishes with the
      impious" For, such evil persons possess nothing of goodness, whence their
      memory could remain. Because: "For it comes into vanity, and goes into
      darkness, and in darkness its name is covered" (Eccles: 6: 4).
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses 7-8</b></p>
    <p>
      "But the Lord sits enthroned forever; he has established his throne for
      judgment" (Verse 7). Here is considered the authority of the person
      acting. So six conditions about God's judgment are exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, that a situation is not just for a moment, but for eternity. For
      some persons, their brief life is one of power. So there is stated: "But
      the Lord sits enthroned forever" (Verse 7).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome has for Verse 7: "The Lord sits as if in judgment". A judgment is
      said to be ever prompt. Such a judgment is not so regards others. Hence is
      said: "He has established his throne for judgment" (Verse 7). Namely, the
      Lord has been prepared. For "The Lord has taken his place to contend, and
      he stands to judge his people" (Is 3 13). The condition is declared as
      universal.
    </p>
    <p>
      So is said "And he judges the world with righteousness" (Verse 8). Now,
      justice infers a carrying out of such things in themselves just. Yet such
      things may not be just in every condition. Because, there are rules, and
      their number, that concern contingencies, or incidents. Nor can all such
      things be referred to the singular, or particular. However, such things
      are in some cases intermingled. For there are certain rules, their
      numbers, and their conclusions, that are not applicable to a particular
      condition as its due. Because an application of universal principles
      pertain to particular cases due to equity; (on the part of a judge).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome thus states for Verse 7: "He will judge peoples in equity" For
      equity (a benign interpretation of rules, or laws) regards particular
      cases. Such cases in all respects, restrain and regulate strict justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, a condition can be fulsome with mercy. Such mercy is commendable
      on the part of the person showing it. For: "When you give a dinner, or a
      banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers, or your kinsmen or
      such neighbors, lest they also invite you in return, and you will be
      repaid" (Lk 14:12). Also: "Did not I weep for him whose day was hard? Was
      not my soul grieved for the poor?" (Job: 30: 25).
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses: 9 - 10</b></p>
    <p>
      "The Lord is a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in time of
      trouble" (Verse 9). Namely, the oppressed poor peoples. For: "Correct
      oppression; defend the fatherless; plead for the widow" (Is 1:17). Also:
      "Give justice to the weak and the fatherless, maintain the right of the
      afflicted and the destitute" (Ps 82 [8l]:3). Such is truth where there is
      justice. Again: "You shall do no injustice, in judgment; you shall not be
      partial to the poor or defer to the great, but in righteousness shall you
      judge your neighbor" (Lev 19: 15). This condition is of time because it is
      at the time poor peoples are in need of acceptable mercy from the Lord
      God. For: "Mercy is as welcome when he afflicts them as clouds of rain in
      the time of drought" (Sir 35: 20).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then is added: "A stronghold in times of trouble" (Verse 9). For, in time
      of trouble, persons turn to God, and God is preached to them. Such ideas
      can be exposed in reference to Christ, as the Lord God remaining forever.
      Because: "Jesus Christ is the same, yesterday, and today and forever" (Heb
      13:8). As Verse 7 states: "He has established his throne for judgment" And
      Verse 8 continues: "And he judges the world with righteousness, he judges
      the peoples with equity" So: "He put on righteousness as a breastplate,
      and a helmet of salvation upon his head" (Is 39:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then is said: "And those who know thy name put their trust in thee" (Verse
      10). Above, the psalmist considered the deed by which divine blessings
      function, and the divine authority of he who did the deed. Here he states
      the fruit of the deed, first in relation to others, then in relation to
      persons themselves, There: "Be gracious to me, O Lord. Behold what I
      suffer from those who hate me" (Verse 13).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then first is exposed the threefold result on others. There is a trust for
      the name of God, and second, the spiritual result of joy for a person
      seeking the Lord God. Third, is an annunciation of the Lord's name, The
      second is there in Verse 11: "Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in
      Zion" And third there: "Tell among the peoples his deeds" (Verse 11).
    </p>
    <p>
      The psalmist leads to such results by a method of exhortation, around
      which he proposes three ideas. First, he leads one to hope. Second, he
      shows what is befitting for hope, and third, why one does hope. So is
      said:"Put their trust in thee" (Verse 10), Because: "You who fear the
      Lord, hope for good things; for everlasting joy and mercy" (Sir 2:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      But whence does such hope come? So: "And those who know thy name put their
      trust in thee" (Verse 10). Such could be desireable since it is the
      greatest good. "And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is
      good but God alone" (Lk 18:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of "Jesus" is principally powerful. For: "She will bear a son,
      you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their
      sins" (Mt 1:21). Also: "That at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow
      in heaven and on earth, and under the earth" (Phil 2:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      And why? "For thou, O Lord, hast not foresaken those who seek thee" (Verse
      10). "Because he is found by those who do not put him to the test, and
      manifest to those who do not distrust him" (Wis 1:2). That is, those who
      seek the Lord with a right intention, since evil persons never find the
      Lord God. For: "You will seek me and you will not find me; where I am you
      cannot come" (Jo 7:34).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, where is the Lord? Now, the Lord God is not among knowable ideas.
      Because: "But supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's
      journey, and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances" (Lk
      2:44). Also: "Man does not know the way to it; and it is not found in the
      land of the living" (Job 28:13).
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses 11-12</b></p>
    <p>
      The psalmist thirdly leads to a second result from divine blessings;
      namely, divinely towards happiness, or joy. So, "Sing praises to the Lord,
      who dwells in Zion" (Verse 11). Here, the Lord is declared in a location
      yet not corporeally. The second book of Samuel, Chapter 6, declares in
      passing that King Davidplaced the Ark of the Covenant on Mount Zion. But,
      according to divine truth itself, the Ark of the Covenant dwells within
      Christ's Church. The word "Zion" is interpreted as: "Mirror" Since, within
      the mirror of the Church a person looks into eternal verities. Thus, a
      person ought to sing praises to the Lord. So, a person who rejoices in
      heart does so by mouth and deeds for all the divine graces granted by the
      Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      The psalmist then leads to a third result of divine blessings. As: "Tel1
      among the peoples his deeds!" (Verse 11). Namely, "As each one has
      received a gift employs it for another, as good stewards of God's varied
      grace" (1 Pet 4:10). At first the psalmist leads into what persons ought
      to announce. As Gregory (around 540-604) claims in his "Rules for Pastoral
      Care" "One garners the results of preaching, as one sows seeds of good
      deeds".
    </p>
    <p>
      So is said: "Tell among the peoples" (Verse 11). Namely, as among persons
      living amidst both believers, and unbelievers. For: "To the thirsty bring
      water, meet the fugitive with bread, O inhabitants of the land of Tema"
      (Is 21:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      It adds: "His deeds" (Verse 11). That is, the Lord God's concern for the
      eternal salvation of the entire human race. "For I know the plans I have
      for you, says the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil to give you a
      future, and a hope" (Jer 29:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also "His deeds!" (Verse 11) is exposed in Verse 12: "For I he who avenges
      blood is mindful of them; he does not forget the cry of the afflicted".
      That deed which a person does with concern and diligence is never
      forgotten by the one doing the deed. Thus, the Lord God is concerned for
      the eternal salvation of the entire human race, and such concern is never
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two things make for forgetfulness: death and poverty. Because: "I have
      passed out of mind like one who is dead. I have become like a broken
      vessel" (Ps 31 [30]:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regards forgetfulness through poverty: "All the poor man's brothers hate
      him, how much more do his friends go far from him" (Prov 19:7). Also: "And
      they cried out with a loud voice, "O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how
      long before thou wilt judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell upon
      the earth?" (Rev 6:10). Thus:is not the Lord God forgetful of a deed.:
      "Who avenges blood" (Verse 12). Namely, of persons seeking the Lord God,
      even if it happens they are killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or: "For he who avenges blood is mindful of them" (Verse 12). That is, the
      blood of holy persons by their reparation within Christ's Resurrection.
      For: "Why has he been numbered among the sons of God. And why is his lot
      among the saints" (Wis 5:5). And is said: "Is mindful of them" (Verse 12).
      That is, not because the Lord God is forgetful, but rather his divine
      delay, seems to us forgetful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, the Lord God does not indeed forget poor persons in their
      poverty, or their children, For: "Behold, the wages of the laborers who
      mowed your fields, which you have kept back by fraud, cry. out; and the
      cry of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts" (Ja: 5:
      4). Also: "For he has not despised or abhorred the affliction of the
      afflicted" (Ps 22:24). Again: "Then the Lord said: "I have seen the
      affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry,
      because of their taskmasters" (Ex: 3: 7).
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses 13-14</b></p>
    <p>
      "Be gracious to me, o Lord Behold what I suffer from those who hate me, O
      thou who liftest me up from the gates of death" (Verse 13). Here is
      exposed the results of divine blessings concerning the psalmist David, and
      second the results themselves. There: "That I may recount all thy praises,
      that in the gates of the daughter of Zion, I may rejoice in thy
      deliverance" (Verse 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      A divine blessing can be twofold. One concerns future time, the other the
      habitual time. There: "O thou who liftest me up from the gates of death"
      (Verse 13).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding a divine blessing for a future time, two ideas are presented.
      First, the divine mercy of God is granted; second, its motivation. This
      future divine grace relates to God's divine mercy. So is said: "Be
      gracious to me, O Lord" (Verse 13). For: "He loves righteousness and
      justice, and earth is full of the steadfast love of the Lord" (Ps 33
      [32]:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome has for Verse 13: "Afflictions from mine enemies". Since, enemies
      afflict the psalmist. Or: "Behold what I suffer from those who hate me"
      (Verse 13). For, the Lord God grants a blessing to the humble. But he
      gives more grace, therefore it says "God opposes the proud, but gives
      grace to the humble" (Ja 4: 6). Thus, Verse 13 can be exposed in relation
      to proud and evil enemies. Hence, the psalmist here ever believed in an
      habitual grace, or blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And: "O thou who liftest me up from the gates of death" (Verse 13). That
      is, as it were: You, O Lord, have raised me up from my affliction that
      could not continue, unless I, David, would then die. "For death has come
      up into our windows, it has entered our palaces" (Jer: 9: 21).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "O thou who liftest me up from the gates of death" (Verse 13). That
      is, the gates of death spiritually indicates heretics. "And the power of
      death shall not prevail against it" (Mt 16: 18).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, gates of death indicates man's senses. "For death has come up into
      our windows" (Jer 9: 21). And it indicates a hatred of God's words.
      Because: "They loathed any kind of food and they drew near to the gates of
      death" (Ps 107 [1O6]:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      Temptations and vices are also considered as heretical. "For thou hast
      power over life and death; thou dost lead men down to the gates of Hades
      and back again" (Wis 16: 13). Thus, one who is freed from temptations and
      vices is the person, you, O Lord, have lifted up from the gates of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      So is stated: "That I may recount all thy praises, that in the gates of
      the daughter of Zion, I may rejoice in thy deliverance" (Verse 14). Here
      the psalmist considers the result of divine graces in a reverse order.
      First, a recounting is declared, and second, a rejoicing. There: "I may
      rejoice in the deliverance" (Verse 14). Third, the Lord's own knowledge is
      stated. There: "The Lord has made himself known, he has executed his
      judgment, the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands" (Verse
      16).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus is declared, as it were: I, David, declare that you, O Lord, are
      pitiful, and I desire that I shall obtain thy divine mercy. And so much of
      this mercy, so that: "I may recount all thy praises, that in the gates of
      the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in thy deliverance" (Verse 14). Namely,
      within the multitudes of Jerusalem's people.
    </p>
    <p>
      So: "That I may recount all thy praises" (Verse 14). Namely, I recount not
      merely all, but even each and every kind of praises. And: "That in the
      gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in thy deliverance" (Verse
      14). Which can indicate Doctors of the Church. For: "I will make your
      pinnacles of agate, your gates of carbuncles, and all your walls of
      precious stones" (Is: 54: 12). Also: "This is the gate of the Lord, the
      righteousness shall enter through it" (Ps 118 [ll7]:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      Again: "That in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in thy
      deliverance" (Verse 14). Namely, rejoice in good thoughts. "For he
      strengthens the bars of your gates, he blesses your sons within you" (Ps
      197:13). Thus, by such gates, I, David, proclaim thy praises, O Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence: "I may rejoice in thy deliverance" (Verse 14). Namely, this one
      divine blessing is considered: the proclaiming of praises. Also here, the
      psalmist considers a second result; as spiritual joy from God. So, he
      first views the joy itself, and then its occasion. There: "That I may
      recount all thy praises, that in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may
      rejoice in thy deliverance" (Verse 14). All such praises were not sterile.
      If they came from the mouth, it was so because joy from God could ever be
      within the heart. "For it is good to sing praises to our God" (Ps 147
      [146]:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      So is said: "I may rejoice in thy deliverance" (Verse 14). That is, not in
      the world, or in the flesh, but in thy deliverance, O Lord, by which you
      lift up me, David. Or, by which you lift me in Christ (the promised
      Messiah and Saviour). For: "Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in
      the God of my salvations" (Hab: 3: 18). Also: "My heart exults in the
      Lord, my strength is exalted in the Lord" (I Sam 2:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Again: "I may rejoice in thy deliverance" (Verse 14). That is, an occasion
      for joy from God is the destruction of enemies who persue holy persons,
      and attack twofold: by violence, and deceit. Regarding violence is said:
      "The nations have sunk in the pit which they made" (Verse 15). That is,
      the fact that nations prepared for the death to other nations, and then
      even they themselves become destroyed. So is said: "The nations have sunk"
      (Verse 15).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome has for Verse 15: "They were submerged" For violence is submerged
      by like violence. Thus, those who are seen to destroy other by violence,
      are finally violently destroyed. For: "The way to peace they know not, and
      there is no justice in their paths" (Is 56:8). Also: "Their sword shall
      enter their own heart and their bows shall be broken" (Ps 37 [36]:15).
      Now, a person is spiritually submerged inwardly, as sins are committed.
      For, by sins a person enters into an eternal punishment. And sinful deeds
      are conjoined by sinful habits. "For he is cast into a net by his own
      feet, and he walks on a pitfall" (Job 18:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the pursuit of holy persons by deceit, it is said: "In the net
      which they hid has their own foot been caught" (Verse 15). That is, like
      hunters, placing nets to trap birds and other animals, proceed
      deceitfully. For: "They set a net for my steps, my soul was bowed, they
      dug a pit in my way, but they have fallen into it themselves" (Ps 57
      [56]:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      So Verse 15 states: "In the net which they hid" Namely, like bird-catchers
      'who literally hide nets or snares. Likewise, other men deceitfully hide
      snares, as they utter words of peace while. preparing their words poisoned
      for the destruction of others. For: "Arrogant men have hidden a trap for
      me, and with cords they. have spread a net, by the wayside they have set
      snares for me" (Ps 140 [139]:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      A third result of a divine blessing is knowledge of God's divine majesty.
      For: "Has their own foot been caught" (Verse 15). Because, an evil result
      is upon them. For: "The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up, his sin is kept
      in stone" (Hosea 13:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "The Lord has made himself known, he has executed judgment; the
      wicked are snared in the work of their own hands" (Verse 16). Namely by
      what? So: "In the work of their own hands" (Verse 16). Sometimes, a person
      within prosperity does not recognize God. For, Pharaoh recognized God only
      within his adversity. So: "Fill their faces with shame, that they seek thy
      name, O Lord" (Ps 83 [82]:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is said: "He has executed judgment" (Verse 16). "So what are such
      judgments, but in the work of their own hands" (Verse 16). It seems
      befitting within divine wisdom that the Lord God dispose all things
      sweetly. For: "She (wisdom) reaches mightily from one end of the earth to
      the other, and she orders all things well" (Wis 8:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord God so acts while endowing things, so they dispose themselves
      toward proper ends by proper means, By such things do sinners consider in
      order to offend, and so fall into like punishments. For: "He takes the
      wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are brought to a
      quick end" (Job 5:13). Thus is concluded: "The wicked are snared in the
      work of their own hands" (Verse 16), For: "The iniquities of the wicked
      ensnare him and he is caught in the toils of his sin" (Proverbs 5:22).
      Also: "His strong steps are shortened and his schemes throw him down" (Job
      18:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also concluded is: "The Lord has made himself known; he has executed
      judgment" (Verse 16), That is, by holy persons ever fleeing snares, "For
      in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird" (Proverbs 1:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Gloss" declares:"One ever easily escapes snares upon this earth who
      ever have their eyes turned upwards to the heavens". Jerome states:
      "Everyone carries ropes, chains, instruments to ward off evil snares" Yet,
      sinners in God's hidden eyes, are trapped within the very nets in which
      they hide, and out of which all holy persons escape"
    </p>
    <p><b>Verse 15</b></p>
    <p>
      "The wicked shall depart to Sheo1, all the nations that forget God" (Verse
      17). Above the psalmist considers God's judgment in relation to his own
      enemies. Here a like idea is exposed in reference to enemies of the entire
      human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then two ideas are presented, First: God's judgment is declared in
      prayer-form against all sinners, and second: the progress of evils is
      considered, There: "Why dost thou stand afar off, O Lord? Why dost thou
      hide thyself in times of troubles?" (Psalms 10:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the prayer-form against enemies, two further ideas are
      presented, First, a punishment for sinners is pronounced; and second, the
      divine judgment to punishment is exposed, There: "Arise, O Lord, Let not
      man prevail, let the nations be judged before thee" (Verse 19).
    </p>
    <p>
      About sinners for sins, three considerations are made, First, a chosen
      penalty is declared; second, the cause of the punishment for sinners is
      given. There: "All the nations that forget God" (Verse 17), Third, a cause
      for punishment is stated in the interest of just, or holy persons, There:
      "For the needy shall not always be forgotten, and the hope of the poor
      shall not perish forever" (Verse 18).
    </p>
    <p>
      So is said: "The wicked shall depart to Sheol, all the nations that forget
      God" (Verse 17), This statement can be understood in two ways: first
      regarding the punishment of the evil in the present time by death; and
      second, in the future by an eternal punishment, So: "The wicked shall
      depart to Sheol all the nations that forget God" (Verse 17), Namely, let
      them be punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is such a punishment ever to be sought? It is suggested that such
      punishment is proclaimed by the prophets in the form of a proclamation,
      and not in a prayer-form, or by conforming onesef to the divine will.
      Because: "But those who seek to destroy my life shall go down into the
      depths of the earth" (Psalms 63:9). Also: "But you are brought down to
      Sheol, to the depths of the Pit" (Isaiah 14:15). And such a pit's depth
      can refer to obstinacy with sins, and evils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verse 17 declares, as it were: Sinners are cast down even in their present
      life. Hence, there is punishment into a casting down to Sheol (or Hell),
      as is declared in Verse l7.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause of such punishments is the forgetfulness of God (the Creator) on
      the part of sinners, For, any sinner who receeds from the end of life
      eternal, tends towards some temporal end, Because, there is a final end
      for human beings: either the eternal enjoyment in God, or the eternal
      punishment in Sheol (or Hell), Thus is said: "The wicked shall depart to
      Sheol, all the nations that forget God" (Verse 17). That is, those sinners
      who forget the commandment of God and his blessings, For: "They forget
      what he had done, and the miracles he had shown them" (Ps 78 [77]:11),
      Also: "You were unmindful of the Rock that begat you, and you forget the
      God that gave you birth" (Deut 32:18).
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses 16-19</b></p>
    <p>
      On the part of just persons, there is another cause of punishment that
      vindicates, For there are two things that the just demand as vindicated: a
      casting-down in time of sinners, and the spiritual power of themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the casting-down in time of sinners being vindicated, there is
      said: "For the needy shall not always be forgotten, and the hope of the
      poor shall not perish forever" (Verse 17).
    </p>
    <p>
      Things of small value are held in contempt, For example, a speech can be
      cast down to oblivion, Yet just persons are not cast down into
      forgetfulness by God, For: "Listen my beloved brethren, Has not God
      chosen, who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the
      kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?" (Ja 2:5). Also:
      "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (Mat
      5:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Although just persons seem to be cast down into oblivion on this earth,
      yet such is never the case in eternity. "For a brief moment I forsook you,
      but with great compassion I will gather you" (Isaiah 34:7). And also: "In
      overflowing wrath for a moment, I hid myself from you, but with
      everlasting love I will have compassion on you, says the Lord, your
      Redeemer" (Isaiah 54:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      When it shall be finally recorded regarding those expressing the needy and
      poor, then such wicked ones will be punished eternally by God. For: "Has
      God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger, shut up his compassion?"
      (Psalms 77 [76]:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding just persons seeking to be vindicated through spiritual power,
      it is said: "And the hope of the poor shall not perish forever" (Verse
      18). Or, Jerome's version for Verse 18: "The expectation of the poor..."
      For, the needy and poor endure patiently their oppression and poverty on
      this earth, since they expect to be vindicated for their patience (within
      an eternity).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Verse 18 states: "Their expectations shall not perish forever"
      Because the poor and needy persues the goodness they hope for, within a
      life eternal. Moreover, such expectation or patience, is even within an
      eternal life in heaven. Not indeed such hope in its essence, but within
      the effects of hope in eternal life hereafter. Yet, such patience, or
      expectation, is not within love (the theological virtue of charity) or
      within justice (one of the four cardinal virtues). For, such virtues as
      charity and justice shall be for all in heaven, both regarding their
      essence and effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psalm 9 concludes: "Arise, O Lord, Let not man prevail; let the nations be
      judged before thee" (Verse 19). Here is proclaimed a divine judgment,
      About this idea are three further ideas, First, the Lord God arises as a
      judge; second, he is implored to judge; and third, the effect of the
      Lord's judgment is shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The psalmist thus declares that the Lord God is never forgetful of the
      hope of the poor, since God himself speaks as a poor man. So, is declared,
      as it were in Verse 19: I, David, request that you, Lord, do not forever
      delay, and so be to my own advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus: "Let not man prevail; let the nations be judged before thee" (Verse
      19). And within this statement, three ideas are considered: First, the
      Lord God repudiates any bad human judgment, because human beings sometimes
      oppress, even without any human reason. So is said: "Let not man prevail"
      (Verse 19), That is, no human being should prevail in order to achieve
      what one desires, For: "Then the righteous are in authority, the people
      rejoice; but when the wicked rule, the people groan" (Proverbs 29:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, the Lord God repudiates another human judgment when it says: "Let
      the nations be judged before thee" (Verse 19), That is, before the Lord
      God, in his judgment, just as if I, David, appeal to you" Now Paul the
      Apostle declares: "I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought
      to be tried" (Acts 25: 10). Also: "Vindicate me, O Lord, for I have walked
      in. my integrity" (Psalms: 24 [23]:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, the psalmist in Verse 20, seeks a listener: "Put them in fear, O
      Lord. Let the nations know that they are but men" (Verse 20). Namely, O
      Lord God (the Father), regarding thy divine Son, Christ, "For the Lord is
      our judge; he will save us" (Isaiah 33:22). Or: "Put them in fear, O Lord"
      (Verse 20). That is, as a punisher, according to thy Law, O Lord, for
      punishment is inflicted according to thy Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome's version for Verse 20 is: "Send bitterness down upon them" And the
      "Gloss" declares: "Man shall not be conforted", Namely, as regards the
      anti-Christ. Thus: "Let the nations know that they are but men" (Verse
      20), That is, the effects of a judgment are due to man realizing
      themselves, as they really and truly are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again: "Let the nations know that they are but men" (Verse 20), That is:
      men are fragile sinners, and mortal, Because: "As often as it passes
      through, it will take you, for morning by morning, it will pass through"
      (Is 28:19).
      <center>
        <b>Psalm 10 (Psalm 9 Continued)</b>
      </center>
    </p>

    <p><b>Verses 1-2</b></p>
    <p>
      The psalmist then continues in Psalm 10:1: "Why dost thou stand afar off,
      O Lord? Why dost thou hide thyself in times of trouble?" That is, insofar
      as afflicting us, while you, O Lord, do not seem to be punishing us, but
      despising us. Why dost thou hide thyself in times of trouble?" (Verse 1),
      Namely, during a time, you, O Lord, could aid, Or: "In times of trouble"
      That is, as you aid opportunely, since holy persons are perfected, as to
      their merit, during their life eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, a divine effect regards dissimilation is exposed regards the fact
      that evils are not immediately punished by God,
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Verse 2 declares: "In arrogance, the wicked hotly persue the poor"
      Namely, the poor are afflicted due to the pride of sinners in their sins,
      "For the zeal of thy house has consumed me and theinsults of those who
      insult thee, have fallen on me" (Is 99:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, there is a divine effect, Since: "Let them be caught in the schemes
      which they have devised" (Verse 2). For: "The iniquities of the wicked
      ensnare him, and he is caught in the toils of his sin" (Proverbs 5:22).
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses 3-4</b></p>
    <p>
      "For the wicked boasts of the desires of his heart, and the man greedy for
      gain curses and renounces the Lord" (Verse 3). Here are considered these
      causes leading sinners into their sins. First, there is an adulation for
      other sinners; second, a contempt for God, There: "And the man greedy for
      gain curses and renounces the Lord" (Verse 3), And third, there is a
      Sinner's presumption, There: "All his thoughts are: 'There is no God'"
      (Verse 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning adulation of sinners for other sinners, these ideas are
      exposed, First, there is the very adulation; second, its effects;
    </p>
    <p>
      and third, the divine factor of clemency to sinners. According to the
      "Gloss" Sinners adulate others by two sins: carnal concupisience in
      themselves; and then the sin of injustice towards their neighbors. Sinners
      are also proud, as Jerome claims: "For the sinner glories within self, as
      he so embitters the Lord God" Namely, in carnal desires, and injustices
      towards neighbors, Thus, Jerome literally claims, is the greedy and
      avaricious person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other versions for Verse 3 have: "A rapacious man" Because: "Woe to those
      who call evil good and good evil, who put darnkess for light for darkness,
      who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter" (Is: 5: 20).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus is said in Verse 3: "And the man greedy for gain curses and renounces
      the Lord" Namely, the man provokes God's wrath. Jerome has this all under
      one verse; so that the next verse begins: "In the pride of their
      countenance, the wicked do not seek him" And such can be exposed as within
      an excess of pride of which a sinner has no concern. This is so, either
      because the Lord God punishes beyond condign guilt or because God does not
      punish in great wrath, since God will punish more strongly in the future
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "In the pride of his countenance the wicked does not send him"
      (Verse 4). Since, on the Sinner's mind is the idea that the Lord God has
      no concern for him. For: "All his thoughts are: 'There is no God'" (cf.
      Psalms 14 and Psalm 53:2) and Job: 21: 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Above was considered three causes for the evils of the wicked: adulation,
      contempt and presumption. Adulation was permissive as God receeded far
      away. Contempt was inductive by a persuading tongue, and from which there
      are two further causes for evils, First is one's intrinsic contempt for
      God, and second, there is one's presumption. There: "He thinks in his
      heart, I shall not be moved, throughout all generations I shall not meet
      adversity" (Verse 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the intrinsic contempt for God, two further notions are
      presented, First, the sinner recalls no idea of God, second, the sinner
      does not fear God's judgment, There "His ways prosper at all times; thy
      judgments are on high, out of his sight; as for all his foes, he puffs at
      them" (Verse 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      So: "All his thoughts are: 'There is no God,'" (Verse 4). Jerome has for
      Verse 4: "In his thought" Since a sinner has no thought regards God:
      "There is no God" (Verse 4). Namely, in the sinner's intention, or
      attention, there is no God, For: "They say to God, 'Depart from us! We do
      not desire the knowledge of thy ways'" (Job 21:14).
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses 5-6</b></p>
    <p>
      The result for contempt for God is: "His ways prosper at all times; thy
      judgments are on high, out of his sight, as for all his foes, he puffs at
      them" (Verse 5). Wicked persons are classed as sordid by their sins; like
      to those of preceeding times. Allegorically, such sordidness can be
      referred to the anti-Christ. Morally it can have reference to such sinners
      from the fact that God is not within their intentions, For sinners tend
      toward temporalities, and by such their souls become sordid, Insofar as a
      person is permeated by temporalities, so far is a person sordid within his
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a person's soul is permeated by God, it becomes better, it is not
      defiled, but cleansed, For: "Her uncleanness was in her skirts; she took
      no thought of her doom" (Lam 1:9). Also: "Let their way be dark and
      slippery, with the angel of the Lord persuing them" (Ps 35 [34]:6). Again:
      "For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me, the
      fountain of living waters; and hew out cisterns for themselves; broken
      cisterns that can hold no water" (Jer 2:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome has for Verse 5: "His ways smite" For sinners proposed to do
      diverse deeds, "And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid
      up for many years; take your ease; eat, drink, and be merry, But God said
      to him: 'Fool, This night your soul is required of you, and the things you
      have, whose wil1 they be? So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and
      i's not rich toward God" (Luke 12:19-21). Also: "Behold, the wicked man
      conceives evil, and is pregnant with mischief, and brings forth lies" (Ps
      7:14). Thus, a sinner attached to temporalities, is not affected in just
      one manner, since this does not suffice, Due to this fact, a sinner thinks
      in many different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "Thy judgments are on high out of his sight; as for all his foes, he
      puffs at them" (Verse 5). Hence, a sinner will not fear, since he does
      consider God's judgment, For: "Evil men do not justice, but those who seek
      the Lord understand it completely" (Proverbs 28:5). Also: "And they
      perverted their minds and turned away their eyes from looking to Heaven,
      or remembering righteous judgment" (Dan 13:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it is befitting to refer to the literal sense of Jerome for Verse 5:
      "They despise all their enemies", That is, they give no heed to God's
      judgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then is said: "He puffs at them" (Verse 5), And: "He thinks in his heart,
      "I shall not be moved" (Verse 6), For sometimes, by God's permission, a
      sinner rides roughshod over enemies. This is the reason why a sinner does
      not consider a divine judgment, Because: "At kings they scof, and of
      rulers they make sport" (Habbukuk 1:10). Also: "So the law is slacked and
      justice never goes forth" (Habbukuk l:lO).
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason why a sinner holds divine judgment in contempt, is
      presumption within himself, Such presumption refers to two things: First,
      there is a presumption as to one's own stability, So is said: "He thinks
      in his heart" I shall not be moved" (Verse 6). Second is a presumption
      regards adversity, There: "Throughout all generations I shall not meet
      adversity" (Verse 6), That is, my rule shall be extended from one nation
      to another, and I shall inflict evils to many.
    </p>
    <p>
      So: "I shall not be moved" (Verse 6). Namely, I, a sinner, shall not let
      go of my prosperity. For: "On the aged man you make your yoke exceedingly
      heavy" (Is 47:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome has: "And he says in eternity, I shall go through all generations
      without adversity" And: "Since in her heart she says 'A queen I sit, I am
      no widow, mourning I shall never see'" (Rev l8:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      The third chapter of the Apostle Luke's Gospel, exposes one idea from the
      Gloss: "A sinner is said to be as one wishing to perpetuate his name, yet
      will not go through publicity and fame" (cf, Luke Chapter 3: John the
      Baptist's Preaching,)
    </p>
    <p>
      So: "I shall not meet adversity" (Verse 6). Namely, I, the sinner, shall
      come into the possession of dwellings, without adversity as violence.
      Likewise will the anti-Christ operate, according to the "Gloss", since, as
      it were: I, the anti-Christ, shall not be thworted, I shall not be
      disturbed throughout all generations, and shall operate as far as what is
      permitted me.
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses 7-9</b></p>
    <p>
      "His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; under his
      tongue are mischief and iniquity" (Verse 7). Here the progress of evils is
      exposed. The first progress is within the heart, that has been exposed.
      Second, the progress of evils is by mouth; and third, by deeds. There: "He
      sits in ambush in the villages; in hiding places he murders the innocent"
      (Verse 8).
    </p>
    <p>
      Two ideas are considered about the evils within the heart. First, there is
      sin itself in the heart; and then its committing, in three ways. First is
      a cursing of God and one's neighbor, which breaks forth in blasphemy. For:
      "They have despised the holy one of Israel; they are utterly estranged"
      (Is 1:4). Othertimes, sinners partially curse God, as they are restrained
      by a fear of God. And again, their curse breaks forth in injuries to
      themselves. So is said: "His mouth is filled with cursing" (Verse 7). The
      "Gloss" has for Verse 7: "You shall love words less" For: "Let all
      bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from
      you, with all malice" (Eph 4:31).
    </p>
    <p>
      Sinners othertimes curse by deceit. Hence, "His mouth is filled with
      deceit" (Verse 7), that is, by treachery. Because "Do not be deceived;
      neither be immoral, nor adulterers nor homosexuals, nor thieves; nor the
      greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor robbers will inherit the Kingdom
      of God" (1 Cor 6:9-10). And: "See to it that no one fail to obtain the
      grace of God; that "no root of bitterness spring up and cause trouble, and
      by many become defiled" (Heb 12:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, in Verse 7, the root of one's heart is indicated, For: "Under his
      tongue are mischief and iniquity" (Verse 7). Namely, the mischief of lies,
      hidden within the innermost recesses of one's heart. The "Gloss" claims
      that evils are like this: A sinner imagines he is perfect in his evils in
      reference to their aim, For: "They taught their tongue to speak" (Jer
      9:5). And: "Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it
      under his tongue" (Job: 20: 12). Again: "Under his tongue are mischief and
      iniquity" (Verse 7), Namely, the destruction following out of mischief.
      For: "Your lips have spoken lies" (Is 59:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "He sits in ambush in the villages, in hiding places he murders the
      innocent" (Verse 8). Here is exposed progress of evils in reference to
      one's body. First, the progress is set forth; and second, its aim, There:
      "The hapless is crushed, sinks down, and falls by his might" (Verse 10).
    </p>
    <p>
      About the progress of evil itself, those ideas are exposed. First regards
      with whom a sinner sits in ambush; and second, against whom, There: "In
      hiding places he murders the innocent" (Verse 8), Third is the manner a
      sinner is within ambush, There: "He lurks in secret like a lion in his
      covent" (Verse 9).
    </p>
    <p>
      The psalmist thus exposes that evil itself is just, not content in mere
      talking, since sinners labor to perfect their evils, Hence is said: "He
      sits in ambush in the villages" (Verse 8). That is, while planning how he
      can harm others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "In hiding places he murders the innocent" (Verse 8), Namely,
      through deceit and oppression. "For he lies in wait, turning good into
      evil, and to worthy actions he will attach blame" (Sir: 11: 3).
    </p>
    <p>
      So, he sits in ambush in the villages" (Verse 8), Namely, he sits with
      other sinners as his counsellors. For: "Wild asses in the wilderness are
      the prey of lions, likewise the poor are pastures for the rich" (Sir
      13:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome has for Verse 8: "He sits in the court-yard" Namely, as if within
      his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, who does the sinner show himself in ambush as against? Indeed: the
      innocent, as: "In hiding places he murders the innocent" (Verse 9),
      Namely, murders spiritually or corporeally. Thus: "And do not slay the
      innocent and righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked" (Ex 23:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      The sinner also shows himself as one against the poor, For: "His eyes
      stealthily watch for the hapless" (Verse 8). Then: "What do you mean by
      crushing my people by grinding the fact of the poor, says the Lord God of
      hosts" (Is 3:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Gloss" claims the anti-Christ holds counsel with the rich against the
      poor. And Jerome declares: "His eyes (the sinners) are upon the poor" That
      is, upon the poor who are not strong with temporalities, yet within
      spiritualities. For: "My adversary sharpens his eyes against me" (Job
      16:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "He lurks in secret like a lion in his covert" (Verse 9). Here is
      exposed the manner while a simile is employed: "Like a lion in his covert"
      (Verse 9), For: "Like a roaring lion, or a charging bear, is the wicked
      ruler over the poor people" (Prov 28:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the manner of the ambush is exposed. Thus: "He seizes the poor when
      he draws him into his net" (Verse 9). Because: "The words of the wicked
      lie in wait for blood, but the mouth of the upright delivers men" (Prov
      12:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      And:"He seizes the poor" (Verse 9). That is, the possessions of the poor
      he seizes by violence and deceit, So is added the manner of seizure: "When
      he draws him into his net" (Verse 9), Namely by enticing the poor by
      praises, either by violence, or deceit. For: "With much seductive speech,
      she persuades him, with smooth talk she compels him" (Prov 7:21).
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses 10-11</b></p>
    <p>
      "The hapless is crushed, sunk down and falls by his might" (Verse 10).
      Here two ideas are exposed. First, just what attempt the evil deeds of
      sinners advance; and second, the cause of such evil deeds, There: "He
      thinks in his heart, "God has forgotten".
    </p>
    <p>
      The attempt of sinners follows the intention for the destruction of the
      haples. Hence: "The hapless is crushed, sinks down, and falls by his
      might" (Verse 10).
    </p>
    <p>
      It happens that sinners at first, are belligerent, Then, they turn to
      life's comforts, and so become effete and soft, feeling abandoned. Thus,
      the philosopher Aristotle claims: "Servants of masters do not ever allow
      their own sons to be reared delicately in their life".
    </p>
    <p>
      Also: "But you laid your loins beside women, and through your body you
      were brought into subjection" (Sir 47:9). And: "They all have gone astray,
      they are all alike corrupt; there is none that does go, no, not one" (Ps
      14 [13]:3). Then an entire situation is exposed, For: "Pride goeth before
      destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall" (Prov 16:18). Thus, a
      spirit of exultation is the sign of their own destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Gloss" refers this entire situation to the anti-Christ, And Jerome
      refers it otherwise, as he declares: "While he entices him". Namely, a
      sinner entices the hapless poor into a net, who is crushed, sunk down, and
      then is struck by the sinner's might. In like manner do lions seize their
      capture prey. They so subject their prey, and then fall upon it with all
      their might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, a cause for evils is the false security the sinner adopts, because:
      "He thinks in his heart" God has forgotten, he has hidden his face, he
      will never see him" (Verse 11), that is, the sinner himself never sees his
      own evil. On the contrary: Do not say: "I shall be hidden from the Lord,
      and who from on high will remember me?" (Sir 16:17). And: "Darkness
      surrounds me, and the walls hide me, and no one sees me, Why should I
      fear?" (Sir 33:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cause for a sinner's false security is adopted regards the future
      times, Hence: "He has hidden his face; he will never see it" (Verse 11),
      because: "Thick clouds enwarp him so that he does not see and he walks on
      the vault of heaven" (Job: 22:14).
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses 12-13</b></p>
    <p>
      "Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up thy hand; forget not the afflicted" (Verse
      12). Above, the psalmist diligently exposed the progress of human evils,
      Here, as if by his own zeal, he implores divine assistance with a certain
      degree against evils, Thus, the psalmist first begs divine aid; second, he
      sets forth his prayers and the answers, There: "Break thou the arm of the
      wicked and evil-doers; seek out his wickedness til thou find none" (Verse
      15).
    </p>
    <p>
      The psalmist prays for one thing, while he proposes another thing. So, he
      implores that the Lord God arise: "Arise, O Lord, O God; lift up thy hand;
      forget the afflicted" (Verse 12). So, the Lord God seems to be asleep,
      while good persons are permitted to suffer, and as the Lord arises from
      such sleep, he frees such persons, Thus: "Awake, awake, Put on your
      strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy
      city" (Is 52:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "Lift up thy hand, forget not the afflicted" (Verse 12), namely,
      forget not in thy power, O Lord". And then is stated in a simile to a
      murderer, who is enraged, For when someone wishes to murder his enemy, he
      raises the hand, since: "Lift up thy hand against foreign nations, and let
      them see thy might" (Sir 36:3). Also: "O Lord, thy hand is lifted up, but
      they see it not. Let them see the zeal for thy people, and be ashamed"
      (Sir 26:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      So a reason is proposed: "Forget not the afflicted" (Verse 12). Thus, the
      entire psalm is composed in relation to sinners afflicting just persons.
      It exposes evils of such sinners, and then afflictions from such evils on
      just persons. Another reason is proposed as results are shown, There:
      "Thou doest see, yea, thou dost note trouble and vexation, that thou
      mayest take it into thy hands; the hapless commits himself to thee; thou
      hast been the helper of the fatherless" (Verse 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Further reasons are proposed on the part of just persons and on the part
      of evil persons, There: "Why dost the wicked renounce God, and say in his
      heart, "Thou wilt not call to recount" (Verse 1-3). Hence is said: "Arise,
      O Lord, O God: lift up thy hand, forget not the afflicted" (Verse 12),
      namely, that the Lord God is unmindful of the poor. For: "Can a woman
      forget her sucking child that she should have no compassion on the son of
      her womb?" And: "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither"
      (Ps 137 [l36]:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a reason is proposed regarding evil persons who gravelysin, as if
      they were not to be punished, "Because sentence against an evil deed is
      not executed speedily, the heart of the sons of men is fully set to do
      evil" (Eccles 8:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      So is said: "Why dost the wicked renounce God, and say in his heart, 'Thou
      wilt not call to account?'" (Verse 13). Which states, as if: Due to such a
      renouncement, evil persons provoke the Lord God by their sinning. They do
      not believe that any kind of punishment will be endured by them. For:
      "Thick clouds enwrap him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the
      vault of the heaven" (Job 22:14), That is, as if God considers and judges
      sinners as through a haze or mist, Thus: "For they say, 'The Lord does not
      see us, the Lord has forsaken the land" (Ezek 8:12)
    </p>
    <p><b>Verse 14</b></p>
    <p>
      "Thou dost see; yea, thou dost note trouble and vexation, that thou mayest
      take it into thy hands; the hapless commits himself to thee; thou hast
      been the helper of the fatherless" (Verse 14). Here the psalmist
      strengthens his reasons for divine assistance. He first strengthens the
      very reasons; second, the results, He claims, as it were: You, Lord God,
      alone knowest the afflictions that evil persons impose upon just persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "That thou mayst take it into thy hands" (Verse 14), Namely, after
      the manner of thy justice, O Lord, as you hold them in the hand of your
      divine power. Sinners are ignorant of the fact that a reason for divine
      providence is unknown to them, "For he knows worthless men, when he sees
      iniquity, will he not consider it?" (Job 11:11). Again: "With him are
      strength and wisdom, the deceived and the deceiver are his" (Job 12:16).
      Also: "O the depth of the riches and wisdom of God" (Rom 11:33).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "That thou mayst take it into thy hands, the hapless commits himself
      to thee, thou hast been the helper of the fatherless" (Verse 14), Namely,
      commits himself in thy Son, Christ, For: "Jesus, knowing that the Father
      had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was
      going to God" (Jo 13:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Augustine, this Verse 14 is in relation to evil persons. So
      he declares: "And he says in his heart, 'He will not investigate'",
      Namely, God will not investigate. Then Augustine declares: "For he says in
      his heart, 'Thou dost note trouble and vexation, so that thou mayest take
      it into thy hands'".
    </p>
    <p>
      A superior sometimes notes a fault of his subject; fearing the subject's
      vexation, he does not punish. Other times, a superior may fear punishment
      for himself for punishing a subject. Thus, an evil subject could say: Do
      not punish me, O Lord, since trouble or vexation does not become you.
    </p>
    <p>However, the first exposition above seems best for Verse 14.</p>
    <p>
      So is said: "The hapless commits himself to thee, thou hast been the
      helper of the fatherless" (Verse 14). Here, the psalmist reinforces his
      first reason in Verse 12: "Forget not the afflicted", Namely, you, O Lord,
      ought not to forget that: "The hapless commits himself to thee; thou hast
      been the helper of the fatherless" (Verse 14), Because: "Break forth into
      singing, you waste places of Jerusalem, for the Lord has conforted his
      people, he has redeemed Jerusalem" (Is 52:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      All such persons who hold fast to God in their own personal world, ever
      look for personal strength to God alone, Because: "O our God, will you not
      execute judgment upon them? For we are powerless against this great
      multitude that is coming against us" (2 Chron: 20: 12).
    </p>
    <p>
      This verse from Chronicles is here declared significantly. Because good
      persons even in this world, defend themselves by their own private wealth,
      or personal power, as much as they are able, For: "Men who trust in their
      wealth and boast of the abumdance of riches. Truly no man can ransom
      himself, or give to God the price of his life" (Ps 49 [48]:6-7).
    </p>
    <p>
      Othertimes good persons try to defend themselves through relatives, or
      benefactors, And then they find no such defenders, so that they abandon
      themselves to God's aid alone. For: "He delivers the afflicted by their
      affliction, and opens their ear by adversity" (Job 36:15). Also: "Did I
      not weep for him whose day was hard, was not my soul grieved for the
      poor?" (Job 30:25). And: "We have become orphans, fatherless, our mothers
      are like widows" (Lam 5:3). Then: "I am reckoned among those who go down
      to the Pit, I am a man who has no strength" (Ps 88:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      If such conditions prevail concerning the hapless by necessity, so much is
      it thus among the poor in spirit, And such persons refer to: "The hapless
      commits himself to thee; thou hast been the helper of the fatherless"
      (Verse 14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the materially hapless is said: "Thou hast been the helper of
      the fatherless" (Verse 14). Namely, for those persons who have no
      defenders, Because: "Father of the fatherless and protector of widows is
      God in his holy habitation" (Ps: 68 [67]:5). Also: "For my father and my
      mother have forsaken me, but the Lord will take me up" (Ps 27 [26]:10).
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses 15-16</b></p>
    <p>
      "Break thou the arm of the wicked and evildoer; seek out his wickedness
      til thou find none" (Verse 15), Here the psalmist proclaims an answer to
      his prayer. First, the answer relates to sinners and second, to the
      hapless, or poor, There: "O Lord, thou wilt hear the desire of the meek,
      thou wilt strengthen their heart, thou wilt incline thy ear" (Verse 17).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the psalmist's answer to his prayer as relating to sinners, two
      ideas are exposed. First, he proclaims the evils from evil-doers' aim,
      that are afflicted upon good persons. Second is proclaimed the termination
      of such evils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning a termination of evil persons' power, there is said: "Break
      thou the arm of the wicked and evildoer" (Verse 15), Namely, those ones
      sinning against God, For: "The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked,
      the scepter of rulers" (Is 14:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "And evildoers" (Verse 15), That is, those evil ones who sin against
      their neighbors, "For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but the Lord
      upholds the righteous" (Ps 37:[36]:17). Also: "From the wicked their light
      is withheld and their uplifted arm is broken" (Job 38:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      When it so happens that some ruler does evils, he still remains within
      such evils even after such deeds are done, Yet, such a situation does not
      prevail here in Verse 15, For the evil deeds actually vanish and the same
      deeds are never done again, But, punishment for such deeds can remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: "Seek out his wickedness til thou find none" (Verse 15), That is,
      find none within the evil one's own world, Because: "Today he will be
      exalted, but tomorrow he will not be found, because he has turned to dust,
      and his plans will perish" (I Mac 2:63).
    </p>
    <p>
      God sometimes permits a person to sin, due to some good that may later
      occur, For example, the wrath of rulers brings forth the virtue of
      patience in martyrs. So, here in Verse 15, any allowance for a sin is not
      found, for such evil has no future usefulness. Yet, how could such an
      allowance for sin exist, since God's kingdom cannot be overcome? Because,
      evil persons will be broken away from God's kingdom. For: "The Lord is
      king for ever and ever, the nations shall perish from his land" (Verse
      16).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus: "The Lord is king for ever and ever" (Verse 16). That is, because'
      the Lord God embraces all time (past, present, and future) within his
      eternity, Or namely, as generations are succeeded by ages, For: "His
      dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his
      kingdom is one that shall not be destroyed" (Dan 7:14). Also: "But the
      wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted
      out of it" (Prov 2:22). Again: "The wicked are like chaff which the wind
      drives away" (Ps 1:4). Also: "I have seen a wicked,man overbearing and
      towering like a cedar of Lebanon, Again, I passed by, and lo, he was no
      more, though I sought him he could not be found" (Ps 37 [36]:35-36).
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses 17-18</b></p>
    <p>
      "O Lord, thou wilt hear the desire of the meek; thou wilt strengthen their
      heart; thou wilt incline thy ear" (Verse 17). Here the psalmist announces
      an answer to prayer in relation to the hapless, or poor, So, three ideas
      are exposed. First is the very answer to the prayer, There: "O Lord, thou
      wilt hear the desire of the meek" (Verse 17), Second is the manner the
      Lord has heard the prayer. There: "To do justice to the fatherless and the
      oppressed" (Verse 18).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the very answer to the prayer, the psalmist shows that the poor
      are efficatiously heard, So the Lord God granted to the hapless what they
      needed. Because: "What the wicked dread will come upon him, but the desire
      of the righteous is established forever" (Prov 10:24).
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, the meek poor are heard in their personal intentions. For
      instance, just persons are heard in their prayers by those things they
      most desire. Thus: "Thou wilt strengthen their heart, thou wilt incline
      thy ear" (Verse 17). For: "Before they call I will answer, while they are
      yet speaking, I will hear" (Is 65:24). Also: "When he calls to me, I will
      answer him" (Ps: 91 [9O]:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the meek poor are heard in their prayer, for the Lord judges the
      meek as poor, since he himself (Christ) is poor. "But with righteousness
      he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth"
      (Is 11:4). Namely, for humble persons. A humble person is one who is not
      established in his own power. For: "They judge not with justice the cause
      of the fatherless, to make it prosper; and they do not defend the rights
      of the needy" (Jeremiah: 5: 28). Also: "He does not help the wicked alive,
      but gives the afflicted their right" (Job: 36: 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, from what effect? "So that man who is of the earth may strike no
      terror" (Verse 18). That is, a terror that is not good, since it is from
      pride. For: "O Lord, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised too
      high" (Ps 131 [130]:1). Also: "But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like
      a child quieted at its mother's breast; like a child that is quieted is my
      soul" (Ps 131 [13O]:2). Again: "May the Lord cut off all flattering lips,
      the tongue that makes great boasts, those who say, 'With our tongue we
      will prevail, our lips are with us, who is our master?" (Ps 12:3).
