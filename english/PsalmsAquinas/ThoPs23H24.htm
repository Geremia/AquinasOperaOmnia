      potestatem auxiliantis. Titulus non est novus in Hebraeo; sed in Latino 
      additur <I>in prima sabbati.</I> Ubi sciendum est quod sicut dicitur Exod. 
      20: Memento ut diem sabbati sanctifices etc., est tertium praeceptum. Sex 
      enim diebus fecit Deus caelum et terram et omnia quae in eis sunt, et in 
      septima requievit; ita et nos debemus pro reverentia septima die 
      requiescere. Unde omnes dies hebdomadae sabbatum appellantur, sicut dies 
      Dominicus dicitur prima sabbati. Matth. ult.: Vespere autem sabbati quae 
      lucescit in prima sabbati. Et deinceps tota hebdomada sabbatum dicitur. 
      Luc. 18: Ieiuno bis in sabbato: unde psalmus hic in prima sabbati 
      commemorat ea quae pertinent ad primam sabbati, idest ad 
    dominicam.</FONT></TD>

      ;>Having related (his) distress and the divine help (for which he asked 
      and received), the Psalmist commends here the power of the Helper. The 
      title, <I>On the first day of the sabbath,</I> does not originate with the 
      Hebrew version (of the Psalter), but has been added in the Latin version. 
      It should be noted that this (title) is the third commandment, as is said 
      at Exodus 20: "Remember that thou keep holy the sabbath day". For God made 
      heaven and earth, and everything contained therein, in six days, and 
      rested on the seventh. And just as (He so rested), so too should we, for 
      the sake of reverence, on the seventh day. Hence all the days of the week 
      are called "sabbath" days, as the Lord's day is called "the first day of 
      the sabbath"; Matthew 28: "And in the end of the sabbath, when it began to 
      dawn towards the first day of the week..." And from that time forward, 
      every day of the week has been called the sabbath: Luke 18: "I fast twice 
      in a week (<I>sabbato).</I>" Hence, this psalm <I>On the first day of the 
      sabbath</I> commemorates those things which pertain to the first day of 
      the week, that is to say, the Lord's day. </FONT></TD></TR>

      qua tria facta sunt: scilicet creatio mundi, productio lucis, et 
      resurrectio Christi, ut in Evangelio habetur Matth. 28. De istis ergo agit 
      Psalmista: scilicet de potentia creantis, et gloria resurgentis; et forte 
      iste psalmus cantabatur in prima sabbati, sed videtur esse disiunctus. 
      Tamen sciendum est, quod tempore David Deus colebatur solum in Iudaea; et 
      David considerans quod Deus est Deus totius terrae, et videns in spiritu 
      prophetico futurum esse quod coleretur in toto mundo, fecit istum psalmum: 
      et de hoc agit hic. </FONT></TD>

      three things were done on this day, namely the creation of the world, the 
      production of light, and the resurrection of Christ, as (the latter) is 
      related in the Gospel of Matthew 28. Consequently, the Psalmist treats of 
      these things, namely of the power of the Creator, and the glory of he who 
      rises from the grave. Perhaps this very psalm was sung on the first day of 
      the week. However this would seem to be incongruous. Nevertheless, it 
      should be noted that in David's time, God was worshiped only in Judea. And 
      David, considering that God is the God of all the earth, and seeing, in a 
      prophetic spirit, what would be, that God was being praised in all the 
      world, wrote this very psalm. And concerning this, he acted 
  thus.</FONT></TD></TR>

      of the one who rises from the grave, at <I>Lift up.</I> Concerning the

      earth in its heaviness tends, as well as all other things subject to (the

      because through its heaviness it tends thither (that is, to the center): 
      and (it, the center, is founded) upon nothing, because nothing remains to 
      it (to tend to - it is the lowest place in the universe). (Now,) Isaiah 40

      ;>Contrary to this (position is the fact that) the disposition of the 
      waters to the earth is a sign of great providence, because light elements 
      ought to be above (those which are) heavier. In a like manner, therefore, 
      just as air surrounds water, so too ought water to surround earth. The 
      philosophers assign many causes to this phenomenon. But the (true) cause 
      is divine providence so that there be a habitation for man and the 
      animals. Hence when Moses, at the beginning (of Scriptures, in "Genesis") 
      sets down the creation of things, he described the earth first as 
      formless. Hence, "The earth was void", that is formless, "and empty" of 
      trees. In this way he describes it (the earth as) surrounded or covered by 
      water, "And darkness", that is water, "was upon the face of the deep",

      strongest shall bear rule"; Job 9: "If strength be demanded, he is most 
      strong." Second, because of (his) might, which he shows when he says, 
      <I>The Lord mighty,</I> because He is the most powerful in the matter of 
      holding dominance; Job 36: "God doth not cast away the mighty"; Daniel 7: 
      "His might is an everlasting might" etc. Third, that he be a good 
      combatant. Hence he says <I>The Lord mighty in battle,</I> in which he 
      conquers death and the devil in all things; Apocalypse 5: "The lion of the

      glossa autem est alia expositio. Christus ad inferos descendit et ascendit

      portas, paradisi. Unde respondens Christus quasi praeconis voce, et vicem 
      gerens, dirigens vocem in caelum dicit, o principes caelestes, attollite,

      ;>However, in the gloss, there is another explanation. Christ descends to 
      the lower regions (to hell), and ascends to heaven. And this he foretells 
      here in two ways. First, he instructs the lower regions to open up. Hence, 
      he says <I>Lift up</I> etc. <I>O ye </I>infernal <I>princes, </I>open up 
      <I>your gates: and be ye lifted up</I> etc. <I>And the King of Glory shall 
      enter it.</I> But when the demons ask <I>Who is this King of Glory,</I> 
      the Psalmist responds He<I> who is strong and mighty...in battle</I> 
      against you. Second, he instructs the citizens to open the gates of 
      paradise over us. Hence Christ, responding as it were in the voice of a 
      public crier, bearing misfortune, directs his voice to heaven, saying, O 
      heavenly princes, <I>Lift up,</I> that is open up <I>Your gates,</I> etc. 
      <I>And he shall enter</I> etc. And to those who ask, he says <I>The Lord 
      of hosts, he is the King of Glory.</I></FONT></TD></TR>

      autem sciendum, sicut dicit Dionysius, quod non est intelligendum sic quod 
      angeli essent ignorantes de mysterio incarnationis; sed admirantes 
      dixerunt, quis est iste rex gloriae, quia gloria Christi excellit omnem 
      cognitionem. Aliquando enim ipse Christus docet de se per scripturam, ut 
      dicitur Isa. 63: Ego qui loquor iustitiam etc. Hic autem non ipse, sed 
      alii de eo, scilicet angeli, respondent, Dominus virtutum etc.; quia 
      aliqui angeli accipiunt illuminationem immediate a Deo, sicut dicitur Isa. 
      6: Vidi Dominum sedentem super solium excelsum, et plena erat etc. Alii ab

      ;>However, it should be noted that, as Dionysius says, it is not to be 
      understood that the angels are ignorant concerning the mystery of the 
      incarnation. But wondering at it, they said, <I>Who is this King of 
      Glory,</I> because Christ's glory exceeds every understanding. At times, 
      Christ teaches about himself through Scripture, as is said at Isaiah 63: 
      "I, that speak justice" etc. Here, however, it is not Christ who speaks, 
      but others concerning him, namely the angels. And these respond, <I>The 
      Lord of hosts </I>etc. For some angels receive illumination immediately 
      from God, as is said at Isaiah 6: "I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne 
      high and elevated: and his train filled the temple." Other angels, those 
      middle and lower, (receive their illumination) from others. And these 
      latter are responded to by the former angels.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
