      <h2>
        THOMAS AQUINAS<br />
        COMMENTARY ON PSALM 20 (Vulgate 19)
      </h2>
      <p><b>translated by F.F. Reilly</b></p>
    </center>

    <p align="center"><b>Introduction</b></p>
    <p>
      In the preceding psalms David considered his freedom from persecution.
      Here in Psalm 20 (19) he renders his due thanks for such freedom. Being so
      freed, or with a hope for his liberation, the psalmist seeks to be
      advanced to greater things.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Psalm 20 (19) is divided into two parts. First, a prayer of
      exaltation is set forth, and second, there is a promise. As there: "In thy
      strength the king rejoices, O Lord; and in thy help how greatly he
      exults!" (Ps 21 (20):1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the prayer of exaltation three ideas are proposed. First, the
      prayer itself is considered, second, is a hope for an answer. As there:
      "Now I know that the Lord will help his anointed, he will answer him from
      his holy heaven with mighty victories by his right hand. (Verse 6). And
      third, the psalmist's conclusion is presented. There: "Give victory to the
      king, O Lord; answer us when we call." (Verse 9).
    </p>
    <p>Concerning the prayer itself two ideas are advanced.</p>
    <p>
      First, the prayer is advanced in relation to evils, and second, its
      advancement is towards goodness. There: "May he grant you your heart's
      desire, and fulfill all your plans!" (Verse 11).
    </p>
    <p>
      This Psalm20 (19) can proceed in another manner. In other preceeding
      psalms, David's prayer was introduced as if he was praying in his own
      behalf. Here, in Psalm 20 (19) is a prayer, as if for others by David.
      And, also literally those things are here said, as referring to David, yet
      properly and precisely they pertain to the Lord Christ.
    </p>
    <p><b>Verses 1-5</b></p>
    <p>
      However, according to mystery, such things pertain to Christ's Church, and
      the just man, and are altogether understood. About this part the psalm
      makes two points.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, an answer of the one praying is condidered, and second, the reason
      for the answer. As there: "The name of the God of Jacob protect you!"
      (Verse 1). Thus is said: O David, or, O Christ: "The Lord answer you in
      the day of trouble!" (Verse l). For: "May he hear your prayers and be
      reconciled to you, and may he not forsake you in time of evil" (2 Mac
      1:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      David suffered tribulations, as did Christ, in his Passion, so is said in
      Verse 1: "In the day of trouble". Namely, of rebuke. For: "They said to
      him, 'Thus says Hezekiah, "This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and
      of disgrace" (Is 37:3). In such distress and rebuke Christ has been
      answered regards himself, and others. For: "In the days of his flesh,
      Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to
      him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard for his godly
      fear" (Heb 5:7). Also: a just man claims: "In my distress I cry to the
      Lord, that he may answer me" (Ps 120 (ll9):l).
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be a triple reason why any prayer is heard. First, through
      divine goodness, second through aid from sainted ones, and third, from
      one's own merit or credit. As the Apostle John claims: "We know that God
      does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does
      his will, God listens to him." (Jo 9:31).
    </p>
    <p>
      A reason for a prayer's answer is said in Verse 1: "The name of the God of
      Jacob protect you." The first reason is because of his name, that is,
      because of his goodness. "May he protect you", that is Christ, or other
      persons who pray to the God of Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>
      This very God, Jacob himself adored, as when God appeared to Jacob at
      Bethel. (cf Gen 28:18-22). That is, Jacob's God, who leads earthly persons
      to heaven, and from this heaven assists earthly person. Thus, does this
      "God of Jacob" protect you. For: "The name of the Lord is a strong tower"
      (Prov 18:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also: "thou holdest them safe under thy shelter from the strife of
      tongues." (Ps 31 (30):20). Again: the name of God is all powerful.
      Because: "The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is his name." (Exod 15:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, God's name is one of divine mercy. For: "He who is mighty has done
      great things for me, and holy is his name" (Lk 1:19). That is, divine
      mercy is God's name. For: "Your name is oil poured out" (Song 1:2). So,
      persons are protected through the divine power and mercy of God. Because:
      "in the shadow of his hand he hid me." (Is 14'9:2). Also: "hide me in the
      shadow of thy wings" (Ps 17 (l6):8).
    </p>
    <p>
      Verse 2 then gives a second reason for an answer to prayer. "May he send
      you help from Zion!" That is, from the assembly of sainted persons on
      Zion, where is two assemblies. One assembly reigns with God in glory in a
      church triumphant in heaven, another assembly comprises members of the
      militant church here on this earth. Now, from such earthly and heavenly
      assemblies persons are helped, as God's own angels intercede for us.
      Because: "But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
      Jesus Christ, the righteous" (1 Jo 2:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, regards an assembly of God's angels: "And the smoke of the incense
      rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before
      God." (Rev 8:4). Namely, such smoke from incense comes from moisture and
      heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ also (King of all angels and saints), helps us. For: "Consequently
      he is able for all time to save those who draw near to God through him,
      since he always lives to make intercession for them" (Heb 7:25).
    </p>
    <p>
      So Verse 2 declares: "May he send you help from the sanctuary, and give
      you support from Zion!" Namely, from the Incarnate Son of God, the Father,
      Christ. For the Lord Christ is anologically termed as: "Holy". Because:
      "therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God." (Lk
      1:35). And: "to anoint a most holy place." (Dan 9:21). And: "from the
      sanctuary" (Verse 2). Namely, out of Christ's own tribulations, as he
      sanctified himself in his Passion and Death. Since: "And for their sake I
      consecrate myself that they also may be consecrated in truth." (Jo 17:19).
      Also: "Tomorrow by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance."
      (I Sam 11:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Verse 2: "May he send you help from the sanctuary." That is, from
      the assemblies of holy, sainted, blessed personso For: "Yet thou art holy,
      enthroned on the praises of Israel!" (Ps 22 (2l):3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Verse 2 concludes: "and give you support from Zion!" That is, from
      David's tent, or dwelling, upon Mount Zion. Here on Zion was an ark, or
      sanctuary, for the Lord's Covenant (or Torah), wherein the Lord God of
      Jacob was worshipped. Thus, Verse 2 declares, as it were: From the prayer
      of those persons who, in this present world, turn to celestial assemblies.
      And so: "and give you support from Zion!" (Verse 2). Namely, may he, the
      God of Jacob, make you, David, safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Verse 2: "from the sanctuary". Namely, from an assembly of holy
      persons in this world. Also: "from Zion". Namely, those who are in glory
      give you help. Or also: "from the sanctuary" (Verse 2). That is, in
      relation to those in the contemptive life to those in the active life as:
      "from Zion" (Verse 2). Namely, as holy persons help by their prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third reason for an answer to prayer is that holy deeds of blessed
      persons are most pleasing to the Lord God of Jacob. So, Verse 3 states:
      "May he remember all your offerings, and regard with favor your burnt
      sacrifices. Now, every deed is good, insofar as a person makes some
      sacrifice, since all deeds ought to be offered as sacrifices to God. As is
      said: "So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the
      glory of God." (1 Cor 10:31). All deeds are indeed sacrifices to some
      degree, just like simple alms-giving. Since: "Do not neglect to do good
      and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God" (Heb
      13:16). And also, like to fasting. For: " In appeal to you therefore,
      brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living
      sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God which is your spiritual worship."
      (Rom 12:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the Old Law there occured certain sacrifices that were not totally,
      but only as partially burnt offerings. For instance, there were so termed
      peace-sacrifices, that were totally burnt-offerings, and so declared as
      most holy, and "Holocausts". This word "Holocaust", comes from two Hebrew
      words: "Olon", meaning a totality, and "cauma", meaning incense. Now,
      there is a dual kind of good deeds. Some are termed "Sacrifices". For
      example, whenever a holy person dedicates his good deed to God, as
      refraining from the marital act upon certain days of the month. As said:
      "A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing." (Eccles 3:5).
      Or again, whenever a holy person sacrifices oneself totally, reserving no
      free-will, and thus rendering self as a complete holocaust.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Verse 3 declares: "May he remember all your offerings." That is, "The
      sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite
      heart, O God, thou wilt not despise." (Ps5l (50):l7).
    </p>
    <p>
      And then: "And regard with favor your burnt sacrifices!" (Verse 3). For:
      "The offering of a righteous man anoints the altar." (Sir 35:6). Also:
      "your burnt sacrifices"! For, a holocaust is a totally burnt sacrifice and
      makes a great odor, since much fat of animals make more odors, or incense.
      Thus, persons totally devoted, offer more than a mere sacrifice partially
      but it becomes their complete sacrifice or holocaust, whatsoever their
      offerings be. Hence all such ideas on offerings, sacrifices, or
      holocausts, may be the ones referred to the person of Christ, (the
      Redeemer), on his cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Verse 3: "May he remember all your offerings." Namely, Christ, (the
      Savior), reminds everyone to recall his own Passion and Death. For:
      "Remember my affliction and my bitterness, the wormwood and the gall!"
      (Lam 3:19). Or: "May he remember". (Verse 3). Namely, the good deeds, as
      offerings to the Lord Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the psalmist above considered an advancement towards goodness by
      prayer. Such prayerful goodness is desired inwardly, and two ideas about
      such is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, the persons desire their prayer be answered, as to what is prayed
      for, and second, is their reason. As there: "May we shout for joy over
      your victory, and in the name of our God set up our banners! May the Lord
      fulfil all your petitions!" (Verse 5).
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning first, the prayer's answer, two further notions are advanced.
      First, is sought that which is inward within a soul's notion, as to one's
      free-will, for an answer. Second, is desired, that answer in relation to
      ideas within one's prayer. As: "May he grant your heart's desire, and
      fulfill all your plans!" (Verse 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, Verse 4: "May he grant you your heart's desire!" Namely, according
      to your own free-will towards some end. As Verse 4 declares, as it were:
      The Lord God leads you to your end, as you, David, so intended, or
      free-willed, while God leads. For: "What the wicked dreads will come upon
      him but the desire of the righteous will be granted." (Prov lO:24).
    </p>
    <p>
      So Verse 4 states: "and fulfill all your plans!" That is, like your ideas
      that lead to your end, David. Since our plans are so weak we cannot
      provide for everything. "For the reasoning of mortals is worthless and our
      designs are likely to fail" (Wis 9:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it is the Lord God himself who leads or confirms our plans by his
      divine direction, since all plans should concern eternal desires. For:
      "Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask, and you will receive,
      that your joy may be full." (Jo 16:24). Therefore, it is God himself, by
      permitting our effectiveness, who really fulfills our plans. As Job
      claims: "He takes the wise in their own craftiness; and the schemes of the
      wily are brought to a quick end." (Job 5:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Verse 5 asserts: "May we shout for joy over your victory." Here is
      presented the reason for the answer to prayer. For, God bestows his divine
      blessings freely on those creatures who extend themselves in behalf of
      other creatures. So is said: "As each has received a gift, employ it for
      one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace" (1 Pet 4:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for an answer to prayer is sometimes the goodness one may
      desire, and that ought to be applied to others. Such reason first occurs
      in relation to a joy regarding many other persons, as if at once everyone
      rejoices.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Verse 5 again: "May we shout for joy over your victory!" Namely, a
      victory, not due to oneself. Since, Gregory, the Pope, (540-604 A.D.)
      claims: "It is just that one should find self within sadness, who, by
      abondoning God, seeks gladness within self."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Verse 5 continues: "And in the name of our God set up our banners!"
      That is, by an invocation to God who exalts, you, David. "For in
      everything, O Lord, thou hast exalted and glorified the people; and thou
      hast not neglected to help them at all times and in all places." (Wis
      19:22). So is stated in Verse 5: "May we shout for joy over your victory,
      and in the name of our God set up our banners!" Namely, then we shall all
      be great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Verse 5 concludes: "May the Lord fulfill all your petitions!" Here
      the psalmist finally considers exterior prayers. That is, regards when
      God, to whom all pray, answers us. Besides, the Lord Christ utters many
      prayers in behalf of all (cf. John, Chapter 16, in passing).
    </p>
    <p>
      Verse 6 begins: "Now I know that the Lord will help his anointed." Here is
      stated a hope for an answer to a prayer. As if it states: Considering that
      we all increase by thy blessings, O Lord. This can refer to Christ,
      through whom many are saved, or to David who was saved by being
      predestined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I know", as if talking before the event, as in 1 Peter: "The prophets
      sought this salvation, predicting Chist's sufferings and his future
      glory." This took place not only by God's saving Christ by raising him
      from the dead: Ps 15: "You did not allow your Holy One see corruption",
      but through Christ the Head's being saved, his members will be saved. And
      he will hear him, that is, Christ praying for his members. "Father, I know
      that you always hear me" (Jo 11:42). Or it can refer to David.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will hear him". Here in Verse 6 the power of an answer to prayer is
      commended. First, as to power itself and second, the experience of such
      power. As there: "Some boast of chariots, and some of horses; but we boast
      of the name of the Lord our God." (Verse 7).
    </p>
    <p>
      Strength, or fortidude, can be classed as a plentitude of power, or virtue
      which is valid for dominating. Such can so refer to persons. So, the
      meaning in Verse 6 is: "with mighty victories by his right hand." Thus
      God, the Father, by his right hand, saves Christ, (his Son) and, also
      saves everyone through Christ. Such is evident with mighty victories, at
      every location, as virtuously, or powerfully, within persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or again: "with mighty victories by his right hand." (Verse 6). Namely, by
      God, the Father, in the magnitude of thy divine power. For: "God gives the
      desolate a home to dwell in; he leads out the prisoners to prosperity."
      (Ps 68 (67):6). So is said: "by his right hand" (Verse 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      Salvation from the Lord God is twofold. One comes, as if, from the left
      hand, by which God saves in temporal things, giving temporal goods: Ps 49
      [48]: "You save men and animals, Lord". The other is from the right hand,
      which is giving eternal goods, whereby God saves the just, by giving them
      gits. Wisdom 10: "God gave the reward of the labors of his saints".
    </p>
    <p>
      Next he give an example of God's power, first showing the different kinds
      of trust and glory that people have, secondly the different result of
      each: There: "they will collapse and fall". For there are two kinds of
      people: Some put all their trust in worldly power. Against them Jeremiah
      (17) spoke: "Cursed the man who trusts in man." Ps 51 (50): "The just will
      look and laugh..." Others put their trust in God: Ps 118 (117): "It is
      good to trust in the Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore he says, "Some trust in chariots, some in horses" etc. As if to
      say, Some trust in worldly power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or this can refer to warfare and victories, as some persons fight on
      chariots, others on horses. Since; "The Egyptians persued them, all
      Pharaoh's horses and chariots and his horsemen and his army." (Exod 14:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Verse 7 also can refer to warfare victories. As some persons do not trust
      in victories, but to the glory therein. For, according to the "Gloss"
      there were dual victories in ancient times. The first kind is termed a
      "laureated victory", as the victor is crowned with laurel, and rides
      around in a chariot. The second kind of victory is called an "ovation",
      and the victor rides around on horseback. Which declares, as if, some
      victors gloried in their victories by an ovation, while on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Latin: "Ovo-ovas" refers to what it is: "to rejoice". So, the English
      word "Ovation" is derived from an occasion in ancient times,when small
      shepherd boys rejoiced, as a sheep was given to them as their own. And so,
      this word "Ovation" can be applied to Verses 6 and 7, as to victories, or
      ovations, in triumphs. And so, "but we boast of the name of the Lord our
      God." (Verse 7).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the word "triumph" is derived from the Latin syllables: "tris",
      meaning "three" and "phonos ", meaning "sound". For, there comes a
      threefold sound from the victories, or triumphs, of the victors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first sound comes to a victor from the entire populace along his way
      of victory. The second sound comes from all the war-captured bound by
      hands, and who follow their victors' chariots. The third sound comes from
      the victor himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A victor is clothed in a tunic of Jupiter (Jove, or Zeus, father of the
      pagan gods), as he sits in a chariot drawn by four white horses. Then, he
      is led to the "Capitolum", or temple, of Jupiter, at Rome. There before
      the victor's chariot is placed one war captive, whom the victor boxes or
      punches, on the ears. Then he shouts to him: "Cognosce teipsum": "Know
      thyself", or behave thyself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Verse 8 declares: "They will collapse and fall". And here a different
      outcome is viewed in relation to evil persons. As St Jerome dubs them:
      "The crooked ones". For, a level path can become curved, or crooked,
      resulting in one's collapse, and fall. Likewise, little by little, the
      powers of this world fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again: "will collapse" (Verse 8). For, temporalities can bind good
      persons, and exceedingly bind evil persons, "because, through part of what
      God created, they became an abomination, and became traps for the souls of
      men and a snare to the feet of the foolish." (Wis 14:11). Namely, evil
      persons, as sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Verse 8 continues: "and fall", Since, all sinners are finally
      constrained. Since: "And many shall stumble thereon and they shall fall
      and be broken; they shall be snared and taken." Namely, little by little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Verse 8 concludes by declaring an outcome of power, as is said: "But
      we shall rise and stand upright". Because: "Rejoice not over me, O my
      enemy; when I fall, I shall rise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord will be
      a light to me." (Mic 7:8),
    </p>
    <p>
      Final1y in Verse 8: "and stand upright". For, an inclination, or curve can
      be a path to one's falling down. And uprightness is the true posture of a
      righteous person who walks within sanctity.
    </p>
    <p><b>Verse 9</b></p>
    <p>
      Psalm 20 (19) concludes in Verse 9: "Give victory to the King, O Lord;
      answer us when we call." Thus, a person is seen to bend, or lean, towards
      two sides. For, either person can pray directly to the Lord Christ, the
      Savior's divine power, or to such power figuratively in Psalm 20 (19).
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Christ's power directly Verse 9 says: "Give victory to the king, O
      Lord." Namely to Christ, (as King of Kings).
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Chris't power figuratively, it is said: "answer us when we call"
      (Verse 9). For: "On the day I called, thou didst answer me, my strength of
      soul thou didst increase." (Ps 138 (l37):3).
