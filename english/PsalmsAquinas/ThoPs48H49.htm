        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><b>a.</b> Supra psalmista invitavit gentes ad gaudium et gratiarum actionem pro beneficiis populo Dei datis; hic autem monet eas ut confidant de Deo: et circa hoc duo facit. Primo excitat attentionem. Secundo prosequitur propositum.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Previously, the psalmist invited the nations to gladness and thanksgiving for the gifts given to the people of God. In this psalm, he advises them to trust in God. Concerning this he does two thing. First, he rouses (their) attention, and second, he pursues (his) intention.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Titulus non est novus. Secundum autem titulum homo dupliciter redditur attentus. Uno modo dicitur attentus reddi aliquis ex parte auditorum, alio modo ex parte dicendorum, cum promittit se dicturum aliqua magna: Prover. 8: Audite me, quia de rebus magnis locutura sum. Et hoc modo loquitur hic. Primo ergo reddit eos attentos ex parte eorum quibus loquebatur. Secundo ex parte dicendorum, ibi, os meum.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">The title (of this psalm) is not new. According to it, a man is made attentive in two ways, namely on the part of those listening, or on the part of the things that are about to be said, when one promises that one is about to say some great things - Proverb 8: "Hear, for I will speak of great things." And it is in this latter sense that the psalmist speaks here. Thus, he first makes them attentive on the part of those to whom he was speaking, and secondly, on the part of the things about to be said, at <i>My mouth.</i></font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Dicit ergo, quod ad omnem differentiam hominum et ad omnes pertinent, quae dicturus est. Et tangit quatuor differentias hominum. Unam ex diversitate populorum: quia alius erat populus Iudaeorum, et alius gentium. Aliam ex parte locorum. Aliam ex parte originis. Quidam enim erant nobiles et insignes, quidam non. Aliam ex parte fortunae: quia quidam divites, quidam non.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Thus he says that what he is about to say pertains to every difference between men and to all (people). He mentions four differences between men. One concerns the diversity of peoples, since some were Jewish, while others were gentiles. Another difference concerns (their) location. Another, (their) origin, for some were noble and distinguished, while others were not. The last difference concerns (their) fortunes, since some were rich, while others were not.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Primam ponit cum dicit, audite haec omnes gentes, non solum Iudaeorum, quia haec ad omnes pertinet audire: et est hoc necessarium: Proverb. 1: Audiens sapiens etc.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">He considers the first when he says, <i>Hear these things, all ye nations,</i> and not just of the Jews, since to hear this belongs to all. And this is necessary - Proverbs 1: "A wise man shall hear..."</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Secundam ponit cum dicit, auribus percipite qui habitatis orbem, idest quacumque parte orbis: et dicit, auribus percipite, quia oportet audire et percipere: Matth. 13: Qui habet aures audiendi audiat, idest attendat.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">He considers the second when he says, <i>Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,</i> that is, in whatever part of the world (they may be). He says, <i>Give ear,</i> because it is necessary to hear and understand - Matthew 13: "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear", that is, let him attend.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Hieronymus habet, habitatores occidentis. Quasi sit quaedam prophetia: quia fides Christi praecipue viget in populo occidentis: quia in aquilonari sunt adhuc multi gentiles, et in orientalibus sunt multi schismatici et infideles.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Jerome has "The inhabitants of the west," as if this were a kind of prophecy. For the faith of Christ especially thrives in the people of the west, while in the northern (regions) there are still many gentiles, and in the eastern (parts) there are many schismatics and infidels.</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Vel, audite haec omnes gentes, refertur ad malos; qui habitatis orbem, ad bonos qui dominantur terrae.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Or, <i>Hear these things, all ye nations,</i> is referred to evil (people, while) <i>All ye inhabitants of the world</i> is referred to the good who govern the earth.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Tertiam ponit cum dicit, quique terrigenae, idest ignobiles, et filii hominum, idest nobiles.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">He considers the third when he says, <i>All you that are earthborn,</i> that is, those who are ignoble, <i>and you sons of men,</i> namely the noble.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Hieronymus habet, tam filii adam quam filii singulorum, quia quidam nihil habent insigne ex parentibus.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Jerome has, <i>As much the sons of Adam as the sons of individuals,</i> since some have no idea of who their ancestors were.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Mystice terrigenae dicuntur peccatores, qui terrae adhaerent per affectum; unde serpenti comparantur: Isa. 65: Serpenti (idest terrenis) pulvis panis eius. Filii hominum dicuntur boni, qui imaginem Dei et Christi, qui est filius hominis, habent.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">In the mystical sense, the <i>Earthborn</i> are sinners who cling to the earth through (their) desires. Hence they are compared to the serpent - Isaiah 65: "The dust shall be the serpent's (that is, the earthly person's) food." <i>The sons of men</i> are called good who are the image of God and of Christ, who is the Son of man.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Quartam ponit cum dicit, simul in unum dives et pauper; quasi dicat: omnes audiatis haec documenta: quia omnibus sunt utilia. Et quae sunt? Matth. 5: Beati pauperes spiritu, quoniam ipsorum est regnum caelorum: Eccl. 31: Beatus dives qui inventus est sine macula etc. Tamen aliquis est dives actu, sed non affectu: et hic potest esse sanctus, sicut Abraham et Ludovicus rex franciae. Alius est dives actu et affectu: et hic non est sanctus. De hoc dicitur Matth. 19: Facilius est camelum intrare etc. quia sicut est contra naturam intrare camelum per foramen acus; ita intrare divitem in regnum caelorum est contra iustitiam divinam. Et tales sunt terrigenae; sed primi sunt filii hominum.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">He considers the fourth when he says, <i>Both rich and poor together,</i> as if to say, "Everyone, heed these teachings" since they are useful to all. And what are these teachings? Matthew 5: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven"; Ecclesiasticus 31: "Blessed is the rich man that is found without blemish." However, some are rich in actuality, but not in (their) desires. And this can be a holy (one), like Abraham, and Ludovic, the king of France. Others are rich in actuality and in their desires. And this does not describe a holy (one). Concerning this, Matthew 19 says "It is easier for a camel to pass..." etc., because just as it is contrary to nature for the camel to pass through the eye of a needle, so too is it contrary to divine justice for the rich (in this latter sense) to pass into the kingdom of heaven. And such are the <i>earthborn,</i> but the former are <i>the sons of men.</i></font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Whoever teaches, teaches either human affairs or words. When we proclaim faith and morals, we teach human affairs; when we expound upon Scripture, we teach words. And so, first he speaks about first teaching, and then he speaks about the second at, <i>I will incline.</i></font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Rerum autem cognitio necessaria est ad duo: scilicet ad cognitionem veritatis, et ad usum operationis. Omnis ergo cognitio veritatis, quae nobis necessaria est de aliis rebus, referenda est ad cognitionem veritatis divinorum. Unde Augustinus dicit: Qui scrutatur haec, non referens ad aeterna, est otiosus. Et ideo omnis cognitio veritatis pertinet ad sapientiam; et ideo dicit, os meum loquetur sapientiam: 1 Cor. 2: Sapientiam loquimur inter perfectos.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">The knowledge of human affairs is necessary for two reasons, namely for the knowledge of truth, and for the purpose of acting. Thus all knowledge of truth, which is necessary for us concerning other affairs, must be referred to the knowledge of the truth of divine affairs. Consequently, Augustine says, "He who examines this thoroughly, but not referring it to the eternal, is lazy." In this way, every knowledge of truth belongs to wisdom, and, consequently, the psalmist says, <i>My mouth shall speak wisdom</i> - 1 Cor. 2: "We speak wisdom among the perfect."</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Id autem quod est necessarium quantum ad usum operationis, pertinet ad prudentiam, qua habetur directio rerum humanarum; et ideo dicit, et meditatio cordis mei prudentiam, scilicet loquetur: Prov. 10: Sapientia est viro prudentia, quia sapientia comparata ad res humanas et materiales est prudentia.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">However, that which is necessary with respect to the purpose of acting belongs to prudence by which the direction of human affairs is accomplished. And thus, the psalmist says, <i>And the meditation of my heart</i> shall speak <i>prudence</i> - Proverbs 10: "Wisdom is prudence in man", because wisdom brought to bear upon human and corporal affairs is prudence.</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Inclinabo. Hic agit de secunda doctrina, scilicet verborum obscurorum: et sunt circa ea duo necessaria. Primo, ut studeat intelligere. Secundo, ut studeat ea exponere aliis.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>I will incline.</i> Here he speaks about the second kind of teaching, namely of obscure words. These (obscure words) are necessary in two ways. First, that one might be eager to understand them, and second, that one might be eager to explain them to others.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Quantum ad primum dicit, inclinabo in parabolam aurem meam. Parabola est sententia aliqua, quando habet obscuram similitudinem; quasi dicat: dabo studium ad intelligendum aliorum dicta: Prov. 1: Animadvertet parabolam et interpretationem eius; verba sapientium et aenigmata eorum.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">With respect to the first, he says, <i>I will incline my ear to a parable.</i> A parable is a teaching when it has an obscure image or representation. It is as if he were saying, " I will study so as to understand the sayings of other people" - Proverbs 1: "He shall attend to a parable and its interpretation; the words of the wise, and their mysterious sayings."</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Vel, inclinabo aurem meam in parabolam, quam loquitur Deus: quia aenigmatice loquitur; quasi dicat: inclinabo intellectum meum ad vocem Domini, qui loquitur parabolice.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Or, <i>I will incline my ear to a parable,</i> which God speaks, because He speaks enigmatically, as if to say, "I will incline my intellect to the Lord's voice who speaks parabolically.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Aperiam in psalterio propositionem meam. Propositio dicitur dupliciter. Uno modo id, quod prae aliis opto, et est illud quod magis desidero, illud, aperiam in psalterio, idest in mea operatione, quia hic est optimus modus aperiendi propositum suum: quia si tu proponis intrare vitam aeternam, non manifestas propositum tuum, si non habes bonam operationem.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>I will open my proposition on the psaltery.</i> Proposition is said in a twofold way. In one way, (it is) that which I wish for in preference to other things, that which I desire more - that (very thing) <i>will I open on the psaltery,</i> that is, in my activity, because here is the best way of opening his proposition. For if you propose to enter life eternal, you do not clearly show your proposition if you do not practice good activity.</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Vel propositio est sermo obscurus, vel propositus causa tentationis; sic Samson, Iudic. 14, proposuit problema: unde dicit: si non arassetis in vitula mea: et sic accipitur hic propositio.

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Or (in the second way), proposition is (understood as) obscure speech, or (as) the cause of temptation; thus Samson, in Judges 14, proposed problems: whence he says "If you had not ploughed with my heifer"; and in this way is this proposition understood.

Primo ostendit de quo sit timendum. Secundo ostendit de quo non debeant timere, ibi, ne timueris. Circa primum duo facit. Primo proponit intentum. Secundo probat propositum, ibi, qui confidunt.

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>Why shall I fear evil?</i> Having set forth the psalm's introduction, in which he rouses the people's attention, he now proceeds to (his) main purpose which is to lead men not to fear evil at hand, nor to trust in goods of the present time. Rather, his fear and trust is in God alone. Concerning this he does two things. First, he shows what is to be feared, and second, what they ought not to fear, at <i>Be not thou afraid.</i> Concerning the former, he does two things. First, he sets forth (his) intent, and second, he proves his proposition, at, <i>They that trust.</i> Concerning the first, he does two things. First, he sets forth a question, and second, he offers a conclusion.</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Quaestio est, cur timebo in die mala? Ubi primo videndum est, quae sit ista dies mala: quia omnes dies sunt a Deo. Sed dicuntur mali propter mala quae in eis contingunt: Eph. 5: Redimentes tempus, quoniam dies mali sunt. Potest ergo dies mala dici in qua aliquod periculum evenit; et praecipue in qua imminet periculum aeternae damnationis, et haec est dies iudicii: Soph. 1: Vox diei domini amara: tribulabitur ibi fortis. Ergo, cur timebo in die mala? Idest quid faciet me timere in die illa? Et respondet, iniquitas calcanei mei circumdabit me. Nihil enim timendum est, nisi peccatum: quia nulla nocebit adversitas, si nulla dominetur iniquitas: Prov. 28: Fugit impius nemine persequente: Eccl. 34: Qui timet Deum nihil trepidabit; et ideo dicit, iniquitas calcanei.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">The question is, <i>Why shall I fear in the evil day?</i> First it must be discerned what this evil day is, for all days are from God. They are called evil on account of the evils that happen on them - Ephesians 5: "Redeeming the time, because the days are evil." Therefore, a day can be called evil on which some danger happens, especially (that day) on which the danger of eternal damnation overtakes one. This is the day of judgment - Sophonias 1: "The voice of the day of the Lord is bitter, the mighty man shall there meet with tribulation." Therefore, (the question) <i>Why shall I fear in the evil day?</i> that is, "What will cause me to fear on that day?" And the psalmist responds, <i>The iniquity of my heel shall encompass me.</i> For nothing is to be feared except sin, since no misfortune will be suffered if no iniquity governs one - Proverbs 28: "The wicked man fleeth, when no man pursueth (but the just, bold as a lion, shall be without dread)"; Ecclesiasticus 34: "He that feareth the Lord shall tremble at nothing"; and thus he says, <i>The iniquity of the heel.</i></font>

First, that it is an extreme part of the body. And in this way, <i>The iniquity of my heel</i> is that iniquity which lasts until the end of (one's) life, in which fashion it is understood as <i>heel</i> - Genesis 3: "She (namely the woman) shall crush thy head", namely the higher reason; but she shall crush the serpent's head: and "thou shall lie in wait for her heel", that is, you will lie in wait for it until the end of (your) life.</font>

First, on account of the impossibility of avoiding the punishment of sin - Job 11: "...the way to escape shall fail them, and their hope the abomination of the soul." Secondly, on account of the evils that befall the evil.

On this account, then, one should not trust in the bodily strength of (one's) friends. And so he says, <i>They that trust in their own strength,</i> namely of their friends, or (for that matter) in their own particular power, since "There is a way which seemeth just to a man: but the ends thereof lead to death" as Proverbs 14 states.</font>

Man should not trust in bodily or spiritual riches, but should seek, insofar as he can, his salvation - Jeremiah 9: "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, and let not the strong man glory in his strength, and let not the rich man glory in his riches". No person composited in his very being can, in any way, redeem himself, that is to say, free himself from sin or punishment - Ezechial 14: "If...these three men be in the midst thereof...Noe, Daniel and Job...they shall deliver their own souls by their justice."</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>He shall not give to God his ransom.</i> Here, he shows that they do not avoid punishment on account of something they do while they are in sin. The reason for this is that sinners stand in need of a two-fold remedy because of a two-fold evil which they have incurred, namely God's displeasure, and punishment's debt. And for this reason they need to satisfy God, which they themselves cannot do, since, by the very fact that they themselves are not pleasing to God and are His enemies, he does not accept their gifts. Thus he says, <i>He shall not give to God his ransom,</i> because external things do not satisfy God, unless they be interior graces which the pure man cannot give.</font>

For this reason he cannot free (himself) from punishment - Psalm 88: "Who is the man that shall live, and not see death: that shall deliver his soul from the hand of hell?"

However, with respect to his sensitive nature, man participates in (the nature of the other) animals. Therefore, the psalmist first describes the honor of man in so far as he has a likeness to the angels.

Therefore, if a man immediately follows his passion when aroused, and strikes when angered, <i>He is compared</i> in his activities <i>to the senseless beasts</i> - Psalm 31: "Do not become like the horse and the mule (who have no understanding)."</font>

Therefore, when man becomes habituated to living according to (his) passions, henceforth he is turned to (them, namely his passions) in (his very) nature. And in this way, he <i>is become like to them,</i> through habit weighed down by evil deeds - Jeremiah 5: "They are become as amorous horses and stallions: (every one neighed after his neighbor's wife)". And thus Aristotle says that the evil man is worse than the evil beasts because when malice or badness possesses intellect, it devises diverse evils.</font>

With respect to the former, he says, <i>Be not thou afraid, when a man shall be made rich,</i> and with respect to the latter, he says, <i>And when the glory of his house shall be increased.</i></font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Et dicit, homo. Homo constat ex duplici natura: scilicet animali et rationali. Et quandoque sumitur pro una, quandoque pro alia. Hic sumitur pro animalitate; quasi dicat: si homo animalis dives factus fuerit: tales enim saepe ditantur. Iob 21: Quare impii vivunt, sublimati sunt, confortati sunt divitiis? Item ibidem 12: Abundant tabernacula praedonum: si ista scilicet videris, ne timueris.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">He says, <i>Man.</i> Man is established (exists) by reason of a two-fold nature, namely animal and rational. And at times, he is understood with respect to the one, and at other times, with respect to the other. Here, he is understood with respect to his animality, as if the psalmist is saying, "If a bestial man should become rich (do not take this amiss, for) such men often will become rich" - Job 21: "Why then do the wicked live, are they advanced, and strengthened with riches?" Again, at Job 12: "The tabernacles of robbers abound" - if you see such, <i>Be thou not afraid.</i></font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Duplex potest esse causa timoris. Una, ne desaeviant in homines: alia, ne ex hoc scandalizentur boni, et deficiant a spe, secundum illud Psalm. 72: Mei autem pene moti sunt pedes.... et dixi: ergo sine causa iustificavi cor meum; quasi dicat: ex quo tot bona Deus facit malis, videtur quod non curet de nobis, secundum illud Malach. 3: Vanus est qui servit Deo, et quod emolumentum habemus, quia custodivimus praecepta Domini?</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">The cause of fear can be two-fold, namely, that they not rave furiously at men, and second, that by this (fear) they not scandalize the good, and deflect them from hope, according to Psalm 72: "But my feet were almost moved...And I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart," as if to say, "on account of the fact that God does so much good for the evil, it would seem that he does not care for us," according to Malachai 3: "He laboureth in vain that serveth God, and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, and that we have walked sorrowful before the Lord of hosts?"</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">With respect to the other (way in which fear can be understood), he says, <i>And when the glory of his house shall be increased</i> - Ecclesiasticus 9: "Envy not the glory and riches of a sinner"; Psalm 36: "I have seen the wicked (highly exalted and lifted up like the cedars of Libanus).</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>For when he shall die.</i> Here he assigns the reason why the evil, if they have become rich, are not to be feared. First, because at some point they will be stripped of all external goods, and second, that they will lose all interior goods as well. The latter (is discussed) at <i>For...his soul.</i></font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Ideo dicit, non sunt timendi, quia Deus reservat tibi maiora. Haec autem quae dantur istis sunt transitoria. Et ostendit primo, quod divitiae transeunt; dicens, quoniam cum interierit, scilicet dives, non sumet omnia, idest nihil ex omnibus quae habuit, poterit habere. Iob 27: Dives cum dormierit, nihil secum auferet. 1 Tim. ultim.: Nihil intulimus in hunc mundum: haud dubium, quia nec auferre quid poterimus.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Thus he says they are not to be feared since God reserves greater things for you. However, these things which are given to them are transitory. And he shows first that riches are passing, saying, <i>For when he shall die,</i> namely the rich man, <i>He shall take nothing away,</i> that is, from all the things that he possessed, he will be able to have not one thing. Job 27: "The rich man when he shall sleep shall take away nothing with him." 1 Timothy 6: "For we brought nothing into this world: and certainly we can carry nothing out."</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Secondly, he shows the sinner's loss of man's glory (at) <i>Nor shall his glory descend with him.</i> For at that time his glory is terminated with his body, and shame in hell is reserved for him. Hosea 4: "I will change their glory into shame." Apocalypse 18: "(As much as) she hath glorified herself (and lived in delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye to her)."</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>For in his lifetime his soul will be blessed: and he will praise thee when thou shalt do well to him.</i> Here, the psalmist describes, first, the interior loss pertaining to the body, and secondly, that which pertains to the soul, at, <i>And he shall go.</i> First, therefore, he shows that after this life, the good of the body is lost to them, and second, that whatever they have had of the good of virtue is ended.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Dicit ergo, quia anima eius. Sicut homo sumitur aliquando pro natura animali, aliquando pro rationali, ita anima sumitur dupliciter.

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Thus, he says, <i>For his soul.</i> Just as man is sometimes understood with respect to his animal nature, and at other times, with respect to his rational nature, so too the soul is understood in a two-fold way. At times, with respect to the rational life, as (it is so understood at) Deuteronomy 6 (where it is said) "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul." At other times, (it is understood) with respect to the animal (or sensitive) life: Luke 12: "(And I will say to) my soul: Soul, thou hast much goods (laid up for many years take thy rest; eat, drink, make good cheer)."</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Dicit ergo secundum hoc, quia anima, idest animalis vita eius, in vita ipsius benedicetur; quasi dicat: quicquid habet de divitiis et gloria, totum est in hac vita; et cessante hac vita, deficit eius gloria: et ideo non potest vitae suae benedicere nisi dum vivit.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Therefore according to this he says, <i>For his soul,</i> that is, his animal (or sensitive) life, <i>In his lifetime will be blessed,</i> as if to say "Whatever he has of riches and glory, this is entirely in this life." And when this life ceases, he loses his glory; and in this way, in his own lifetime, he cannot benefit except while he is alive.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Item aliquando peccatores laudant Deum, vel faciunt opera de genere bonorum; sed si adversitas immineat, cessat eius laudatio, sive operatio bona. Et ideo convertit se ad Deum dicens: o Deus, iste talis, scilicet peccator, sive aliquis in prosperitate existens, confitebitur tibi, idest laudabit te, cum benefeceris ei, idest dederis sibi bona temporalia quae amat. Prov. 10: Benedictio Domini divites facit.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Again, sometimes sinners praise God, or do works of the class of good (works). However, if adversity threatens, he ceases his praise or the doing of good works. And thus he turns himself toward God saying: O God, <i>One</i> of that sort, namely a sinner, or someone existing in prosperity, <i>Will confess you</i> , that is, will praise you, W <i>hen thou shalt do well to him,</i> that is, when you have given to him temporal goods which he loves - Proverbs 10: "The blessing of the Lord maketh men rich."</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Jerome has "They will praise you when they will have done well for themselves", that is to say, men praise and serve riches as long as they are present to and prosper in riches.
