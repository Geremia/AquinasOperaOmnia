      >Lo, your enemies have made a noise: and those who hate you have lifted up
      the head. They have taken malicious counsel against your people, and have
      consulted against your Saints. They have said: “Come, and let us destroy
      them, so that they be not a nation; and let the name of Israel be
      remembered no more” (Ps. lxxxii.).</i
    >
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Almighty God, the Lover of mankind, makes use of us, as St. Augustine says
    (<i>I De doctrina christiana</i>), both for the sake of His own goodness,
    and for our advantage. He makes use of us for His own goodness, that man may
    glorify Him. “Every one who calls upon My name, I have created him for My
    glory” (Isa. xliii 3). He likewise makes use of us for our own advantage, in
    order that He may give salvation to all. “Who wishes all men to be saved” (1
    Tim. ii. 4). At the birth of Our Lord, an angel proclaimed this harmony
    between God and man, saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and peace on
    earth to men of good will” (Luke ii. 14).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But, although God, who is Almighty, could, of Himself alone, have caused man
    to glorify Him, and to obtain salvation, He has willed that a certain order
    should. be preserved in this work of salvation. Consequently He has
    appointed ministers, by whose labours the twofold end of man’s creation is
    to be accomplished. These ministers are rightly spoken of as God’s
    coadjutors” (1 Cor. iii. 9). But Satan strives, in his jealousy, to hinder
    both the Divine glory and the salvation of mankind. He, in like manner,
    endeavours to effect his purpose by means of his ministers, whom he incites
    to persecute the servants of God, The emissaries of Satan show clearly that
    they are the enemies both of God, whose glory they endeavour to frustrate,
    and, of man, against whose salvation they wage war. More especially do they
    show themselves hostile to the ministers of God, whom they persecute. “They,
    have persecuted us; and they do not please God; they are adversaries to all
    men (1 Thes, ii, 15). On this account, the Psalmist, in the verse which we
    have quoted, enumerates three points.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    First he mentions the hatred borne by the ministers of Satan to God. “Lo,
    your, enemies have made a noise,” <i>i.e.</i> they who formerly spoke
    secretly against You, do not fear now to oppose You publicly. The Gloss
    tells us, that these words refer to the days of Antichrist, when, the
    enemies of the Lord, being no longer subdued by fear, will cry out, against
    Him aloud. And, as their clamour will be an unreasoning tumult, it is spoken
    of as a noise, rather than a voice. They will not, however, manifest their
    hatred of God by sound only, but also by deeds. “Those who hate you have
    lifted up, their head,” <i>ie.</i>, Antichrist, as the Gloss says. And not
    only Antichrist, the head himself, but likewise his members, who we heads
    under his head, and being governed by him as their head, are able so much
    the more efficaciously to persecute the saints of God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Secondly, the Psalmist points out how Antichrist and his ministers wage war
    against the whole human race. Hence he adds, “They having taken malicious
    counsel against your people”; or, according to another version: “They have
    devised crafty things, that they may deceive them.” This reading agrees with
    the words of Isaiah (iii. 12), “O my people, those who call you blessed, the
    same deceive you.” They deceive, as the Gloss adds, “with flattering words.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Thirdly, David shows how the ministers of Satan persecute the servants of
    God. For, he continues, “They have consulted against your saints,” “not” (as
    the Gloss points out) “against men of moderate virtue, but even against
    heavenly men.” Hence St. Gregory (<i>Lib. Moral.</i> XIII), expounding the
    words of Job (xvi. 11) “they have opened their mouths against me; they have
    reproached me,” etc. says: “The reprobate, chiefly, persecute those men in
    the Holy Church whom, they judge likely to be of service to many.” The Saint
    further adds, “These enemies of God deem themselves to have performed a
    great deed, if they can destroy the life of the preachers of the Gospel.”
    They nourish two designs against the Saints. First, they wish to sweep them
    from the face of the earth. “Our enemies resolve to destroy us, and
    extinguish your inheritance” (Esth. xiii. 15). Secondly, the ministers of
    Satan desire, if they cannot succeed in slaying the preachers of the Gospel,
    at least to ruin their good name among men, so that their words way produce
    no fruit. Do not the rich oppress you by might? Do they not blaspheme the
    good name that is invoked upon you? (James ii. 6). Now the Psalmist alludes
    to the first of these wicked designs in these words: “Come” (for, thus, as
    the Gloss says, these reprobates summon their accomplices), “let us destroy
    them” (<i>i.e.</i>, the Saints”), “so that they be not a nation.” These
    words the Gloss understands to mean, “Let us destroy them, that they be not
    among the nations: <i>i.e.</i>, let us destroy them from the world. This is
    the persecution of Antichrist.” David makes allusion to this second design
    of Satan against the preachers of the Gospel, in the words, “Let the name of
    Israel be remembered no more,” meaning by this, as the Gloss explains, let
    their name be held in no esteem by such as consider themselves the true
    children of Israel.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    In former days, tyrants sought to rid the world of the Saints by violence.
    St. Paul writes that he saw the literal accomplishment of the verse of the
    Psalm, “for your sake we are put to death all the day long: we are accounted
    as sheep for the slaughter” (Rom. viii. 36). But in our day, the enemies of
    God’s work aim at this indeed, but rather by cunning counsels, devised
    especially against religious, who, by word and example, may spread
    throughout the world the perfection which they profess. Their persecutors
    refuse to furnish them with certain necessities of life. They, further,
    withdraw from them spiritual solace. They impose on them again, bodily
    hardship, in the hopes, that their condition may thus be rendered burdensome
    and ignominious, and that they may, finally, cease to exist.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    First, their enemies endeavour, as far as they can, to deprive religious of
    the means of study and of becoming learned, in order that they may be unable
    either to confute the adversaxies of the truth, or to draw spiritual
    consolation from the Scriptures. This was the cunning practised by the
    Philistines. “The Philistines had taken this precaution; lest the Hebrews
    should make them swords or spears” (1 Sam xiii. 19). The Gloss interprets
    this passage as signifying the prohibition to study. This mode of
    persecution was first practised against the Christians by Julian the
    Apostate, as we read in Ecclesiastical history.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Secondly, the enemies of religious seek to prevent their consorting with
    learned men, in order that, thus, their life may fall into disrepute. “And
    that no man might buy or sell, but he that has the character or the name of
    the beast” (Apoc. xiii. 17), by consenting, that is, to their malice.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Thirdly, these same malicious men seek to hinder religious from preaching,
    and from hearing Confessions, by which means they might effect much good to
    souls. “Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved” (1
    Thes. ii. 16).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Fourthly, they seek to oblige religious to labour with their hands, that so
    they may become weary of, and be disgusted with, their state of life; and
    that they, may be impeded in the discharge of their spiritual functions.
    They were anticipated in this device by that King Pharaoh, who said, “See,
    the people of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we. Come
    let us wisely oppress them...” “Therefore,” it is added, “he set over them
    masters of the works “ (Exod <i>.</i> i. 9). According to the Gloss, “
    Pharaoh means Zabulum who imposes a heavy yoke of earth, signifying the
    labour of tilling the soil.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Fifthly, the enemies of religious malign them, and blaspheme against their
    perfection, <i>i.e.</i> the poverty of the Mendicant Orders. “Many shall
    follow their luxuries; through whom the way of truth shall be evilly spoken
    of” (2 Peter ii, 2). The Gloss understands by “the way of truth,” good
    works.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Sixthly, as far as they are able, they try to deprive religious of alms, and
    of all other means of subsistence. “And as if these things were not enough
    for him,” writes St. John, “neither does he himself receive the brethren;
    and those who receive them he forbids (3 Jn). The Gloss thus comments on,
    these words, “And, as if these things were not enough for him,” <i>i.e.</i>,
    as if it did not suffice him to dissuade others from exercising hospitality,
    “neither does he himself receive the brethren,” ie. the indigent, “and those
    who receive them he forbids,” <i>i.e.</i>, he forbids them to give
    assistance to those in want.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Seventhly, the ministers of Satan endeavour to tarnish the reputation of the
    Saints; and that, not only by word, but by letters, sent to all parts of the
    world. “From the prophets of Jerusalem, corruption is gone forth into all
    the land” (Jer. xxiii. 13). St. Jerome, expounding this text, says, “These
    words are our testimony against those who send forth into the world letters
    full of lies and deceit and perjury, wherewith to pollute the ears of those
    who hear them.” For it is not enough for the servants of the devil to
    nourish themselves with their own malice, or to injure those at hand, but
    they must strive to defame their enemies, and spread their blasphemies
    against them over the entire globe.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    In our attempt to cheek the calumnies of these foul tongues, we shall
    proceed in the following order.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    First, as their malice seems entirely directed against religious, we shall
    show what the religious life is, and wherein its perfection consists (ch.
    1).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Secondly, we shall demonstrate the worthlessness and folly of the reasons
    which their enemies adduce against the religious (chs. 2-7).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Thirdly, we shall point out that the accusations brought against religious
    are calumnious (chs 8-28).

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        IN order to understand the meaning of religion, we must know the
        etymology of the word. St. Augustine, in his book
        <i>De vera religione</i> considers it to be derived from
        <i>re-ligare</i> (to re-bind). One thing is bound to another, when it is
        so joined to it, that it cannot separate from it, and unite itself to
        anything else. The word <i>re-binding,</i> however, implies that one
        thing, though united to another, has begun, in some degree, to
        disconnect itself from that other. Now every creature existed,
        originally, rather in God than in itself. By creation, however, it came
        forth from God, and, in a certain measure, it began, in its essence, to
        have an existence apart from Him. Hence every rational creature ought to
        be reunited to God, to whom it was united before it existed apart from
        Him, even as “unto the place whence the rivers come, they return to flow
        again” (Ecclesiast <i>.</i> i.). Therefore, St. Augustine says, (<i
          >De vera religione</i
        >), “ Religion reunites us to the one Almighty God.” We find the same
        idea expressed in the commentary of the Gloss, on the words, “for of
        Him, and by Him” (Rom. xi. 36).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The first bond whereby man is united to God, is that of Faith. For, “ he
        who comes to God must believe” (Heb. xi. 6). <i>Latria,</i> which is the
        worship of God as the Beginning of all things, is the duty of man in
        this life. Hence religion, primarily and chiefly, signifies
        <i>latria</i>, which renders worship to God by the expression of the
        true Faith. St. Augustine makes the same observation in his
        <i>De civitate Dei</i> (book 10), where he says, “Religion signifies not
        worship of any kind, but the worship of God.” Cicero in his ancient
        <i>Rhetoric</i> gives almost the same definition of religion. He says
        that “Religion is that which presents certain homage and ceremonies to a
        higher nature, which men call the Divine Nature.” Hence all that belongs
        to the true Faith, and the homage of <i>latria</i> which we owe to God,
        are the primary and chief elements of religion. But, religion is
        affected, in a secondary manner, by everything by which we manifest our
        service to God. For, as St. Augustine says in his <i>Enchiridion</i>,
        “God is worshipped not only by faith, but likewise by hope and charity.
        Hence all offices of charity may be called works of religion. In in this
        sense St. James says (i. 27), “Religion clean and undefiled before God
        and the Father, is this: to visit the orphans and the widow in their
        tribulation,” etc.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Religion then bears a twofold meaning. its first signification is that
        re-binding, which the word implies, whereby a man unites himself to God,
        by faith and fitting worship. Every Christian, at his Baptism, when he
        renounces Satan and all his pomps, is made partaker of the true
        religion. The second meaning of religion is the obligation whereby a man
        binds himself to serve God in a peculiar manner, by specified works of
        charity, and by renunciation of the world. It is in this sense that we
        intend to use the word religion at, present. By charity, befitting
        homage is rendered to God. This homage may be paid to Him by the
        exercise of either te active or the contemplative life. Homage is paid
        to Him by the various duties of the active life, whereby works of
        charity are performed towards our neighbour. Therefore, some religious
        orders, such as the monastic and hermetical, are instituted for the
        worship of God by contemplation. Others have been established to serve
        God in His members, by action. Such are the Orders wherein the brethren
        devote themselves to assisting the sick, redeeming captives, and to
        similar works of mercy. There is no work of mercy for the performance of
        which a religious order may not be instituted; even though one be not as
        yet established for that specific purpose.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As by Baptism man is re-united to God by the religion of faith, and dies
        to sin; so, by the vows of the religious life, he dies, not only to sin,
        but also to the world, in order to live solely for God in that work in
        which he has dedicated himself to the Divine service. As the life of the
        soul is destroyed by sin; so likewise the service of Christ is hindered
        by worldly occupations. For, as St, Paul says (2 Tim. ii. 4), “No man
        being a soldier to God, entangles himself with secular businesses.” It
        is on this account, that, by the vows of religion, sacrifice is made of
        all those things in which the heart of man is wont to be especially
        absorbed, and which are, consequently, his chief obstacles in the
        service of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        That which, first and chiefly, engrosses man is marriage. Hence St. Paul
        writes (1 Cor. vii. 23). “I would have you to be without solicitude. He
        who is without a wife is solicitous for the things that belong to the
        Lord, how he may please God. But he who is with a wife, is solicitous
        for the things of the world, how he may please his wife; and he is
        divided.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The second thing that fills man’s heart, is the possession of earthly
        riches. “The care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches chokes
        the word, and he becomes fruitless” (Mat xiii. 22). Hence the Gloss,
        commenting on the words of Luke (viii.), “But that which fell among
        thorns,” etc., says, “Riches, although men seem to take pleasure in
        them, become as thorns to their possessors. They pierce the hearts of
        such as covetously desire, and avariciously hoard them.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The third thing on which man is inclined to centre his heart, is his own
        will. He who is his own master has the care of directing his life.
        Therefore, we are counselled to commit the disposal of ourselves to
        Divine Providence, “casting all your care upon Him, for He has care of
        you” (1 Peter v. 7). “Have confidence in the Lord with all your heart,
        and lean not upon, your own prudence” (Prov. iii. 5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence perfect religion is consecrated to God by a three-fold vow: by the
        vow of chastity whereby marriage is renounced, by the vow of poverty,
        whereby riches are sacrificed, and by the vow of obedience, whereby
        self-will is immolated. By these three vows man offers to God the
        sacrifice of all that he possesses. By the vow of chastity, he offers
        his body, according, to the words of St. Paul, “Present your bodies a
        living sacrifice” (Rom. xii. 1). By the vow of poverty, he makes an
        offering to God of all his external possessions, as did St. Paul, who
        says, “that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in Jerusalem to
        the Saints” (Rom. xv. 31). By the vow of obedience, he offers to God
        that sacrifice of the spirit of which David says, “the sacrifice to God
        is an afflicted spirit” etc. (Ps. l. 19).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But these three vows are, in the sight of God, not a sacrifice only, but
        also a holocaust. This, in the Old Law, was the most acceptable form of
        sacrifice. St. Gregory says (8 <i>Homil. II. part. on Ezech.</i>), “When
        a man vows to God one part only of his possessions, he offers a
        sacrifice. When, however, he offers all that he has, all that he loves,
        and his entire life to the Almighty, he presents to Him a holocaust.”
        Hence religion, understood in its secondary sense, in so far as it
        presents a sacrifice to God, imitates religion taken in its primary
        sense. There are some who renounce a part of the things which are
        sacrificed by the religious vows; but this partial renunciation is not
        perfect religion. The observances customary in religious orders are
        intended to be helps, either to the avoidance of what has been renounced
        by the vows, or to the accomplishment of the promises which religious
        make to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence we see that in a certain sense (<i>secundum quid)</i> one
        religious Order may be judged more perfect than another. The complete
        perfection of anything consists in its prosecution of the end to which
        it is ordained. The perfection of a religious Order depends, chiefly,
        upon two things. First, it depends upon the purpose for which the Order
        was instituted. That Order is the most perfect which is destined to the
        noblest work. Thus a comparison may be made between the active and
        contemplative Orders, according to the comparative utility and dignity
        of the active and contemplative life. Secondly, a religious Order is
        more or less perfect in proportion as it fulfils the end whereto it was
        instituted. It is not enough for an order to be established for a
        specific purpose, unless its customs and observances be adapted to the
        attainment of that purpose. It two Orders be founded for the sake of
        contemplation, that one in which contemplation is chiefly facilitated,
        must be considered the more perfect of the two. But because, in the
        words of St. Augustine, “ None can begin a new life, unless he repent of
        his old life,” any religious Order, in which a man begins to lead a new
        life, must be a state of penance, whereby he may be purged of his old
        life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For this reason, a third comparison may be made between religious
        Orders. That one being reputed the most perfect, wherein the most
        austerities and penitential exercises, such as fasts and poverty, are
        practised. But the first points which we have mentioned are the most
        essential to religious life. A conclusion as to the perfection of an
        Order, must, therefore, be based upon the perfection with which these
        points are observed. For perfection of religious life depends more upon
        interior justice, than upon external abstinence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We see then what is the nature of religion; or the religious life, and
        in what religious perfection consists. Our next task will be to repeat
        the arguments adduced by the adversaries of Religion, and then to refute
        them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We shall proceed, therefore, in the following order. We shall enquire:

        CONSTANT efforts have been made to hinder religious from becoming
        learned, and thereby, to ensure their inability to teach. The words of
        our Lord, “But be not ‘you called, Rabbi” (Matt. xxiii. 8), have been
        quoted in defence of these measures. It has been maintained, that, as,
        these words are a counsel to be observed by the perfect, Religious, as
        professors of perfection, ought in deference to them, to abstain from,
        teaching. St. Jerome, likewise has been brought forward as an advocate
        against the propriety of teaching being undertaken by religious. This
        saint, in his epistle to Riparius and Desiderius against Vigilantius
        (and the words are quoted in Gratian, <i>xvi. Quaest. I</i>), writes
        thus: “The office of a monk is to mourn, not to teach.” Again, in VII.
        Quaest. I, cap. <i>Hoc nequaquam,</i> it is said, “The life of monks is
        one of subjection and discipline, not of teaching, nor ruling, nor of
        being pastors over others.” And as canons regular and other religious
        are classed as monks (as it is stated in
        <i>Extra de postulando, ex parte</i>, and <i>Quod Dei timor</i>), it
        follows that no religious way lawfully teach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is further argued, that teaching is contrary to the vow of a
        religious, whereby he renounces the world. “For all that is in the world
        is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,”
        by which we understand riches, pleasures, and honour. Now teaching is
        considered to be an honour; and this theory is thought to be supported
        by the Gloss upon the words of St, Matthew (iv. 5), “He set Him upon the
        pinnacle.” “In Palestine,” says the Gloss, “ the roofs were flat, and
        the Doctors sat thereon, and spoke to the people. The devil seduced many
        of them with vainglory. For they were puffed up by the honour of
        teaching.” On these words is based the conclusion that teaching is
        contrary to the vow of religious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, it is urged, that, Religious are bound as stringently, to
        practise perfect humility, as they are obliged to observe perfect
        poverty. As their vow of poverty forbids them to possess anything of
        their own, so the humility, to which they are bound, does not permit
        them to enjoy any honour. Teaching is, as has been proved, an honour. It
        is not lawful, consequently, for religious to teach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A passage from Dionysius (V. cap. <i>Eccles. hierarch</i>), is quoted as
        a proof that religious ought not to teach. This writer divides the
        hierarchy into three classes, those who perform sacred functions; those
        who share in these functions; and those who merely, receive the benefit
        of them. In the same chapter, he divides these functions likewise into
        three classes, viz., that of cleansing, which is the office of deacons;
        that of enlightening, which is, the office of priests; and that of
        making others perfect, which is the office of bishops. Those that
        receive the benefit of these sacred functions are also, again, divided
        into three classes, Of these, the first consists of the unclean, who are
        purified by the deacons; the second is composed of the holy people of
        God who are enlightened by priests; and, the third class is formed by
        monks, who are of a higher rank than the other classes), and these are
        perfected by bishops. Hence the function of monks is to receive
        holiness, not to impart it to others. And as they who teach must
        instruct their pupils in sacred science, teaching is not the lawful work
        of monks.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, the scholastic office is more remote from the monastic life than
        is the ecclesiastical. But we find (<i>XVI, quaest. I</i>), that “no one
        can exercise the priestly functions, and persevere in the due observance
        of monastic rules.” Much less then can a monk devote himself to the
        scholastic office, by teaching or listening.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is likewise supposed to be contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles
        for religious to teach. For St. Paul says (2 Cor. x. 13), “We will not
        glory beyond our measure, but according to the measure of the rule
        which, God has measured to us.” On these words, the Gloss thus comments:
        “We use power in-so-far as it has been given to us by the Author of our
        being: but we do not go beyond the limit, or measure, of our power.” The
        argument, drawn from these words, is that any religious, overstepping
        the measure of power assigned by the author of his rule, contravenes ths
        Apostolic doctrine. An no religious order originally included teachers,
        no monk ought to be promoted to the scholastic office.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Some enemies of religion, however, failing in their attempt to
        completely prevent religious from teaching, try to prove, that no
        religious community ought to have many teachers. In support of this
        theory they quote the words of St. James (iii. 1), “Let not many of you
        become teachers, my brethren.” These words the Gloss explains to mean,
        “Do not desire to have many teachers in the Church.” Now one community
        of religious is one Church. Hence there ought not to be many masters in
        a religious community. St. Jerome writes thus to Rusticus—and the words
        are quoted in <i>VII. quaest. 1</i>.—“Bees have one queen. Cranes follow
        one leader. There is one captain to a vessel. And one lord in a house.”
        Hence in one community of religious, it is argued, there ought to be
        only one master.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Furthermore, it must be remembered that there are many religious
        communities. If each college has more than one teacher, there will be so
        many religions teachers, that secular masters will, from dearth of
        pupils, be altogether shut out from the profession. There ought, also,
        to be a definite number of teachers for every branch of learning; but
        this great multiplicity of religious professors will cause sacred
        science to be held in low esteem.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        These advocates of half measures, commit, in reality, as great an error,
        as those who desire to see religious totally excluded from the office of
        teaching. For, all who go astray and cannot keep on the beaten track of
        truth, fall, in their efforts to avoid one mistake, into the opposite
        error. Thus, Sabellius, as St. Augustine remarks, striving to keep clear
        of the Arian heresy of the division of the Divine Essence, fell into the
        error of confusing the Divine Persons. Boethius also observes that
        Eutyches, although avoiding the Nestorian heresy of dividing the Person
        of Christ, fell into the error of teaching that in Him there is unity of
        nature. The same observation applies to Pelagius, to Manichaeus and to
        other heretics. On this account St. Paul speaks (2 Tim iii. 8) of “men
        corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.” On which text the
        Gloss enlarges, by saying, that such men “do not stay in the faith, but
        walk round about it, never remaining on the mean line.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The, passages quoted from the <i>Decretals</i> and the writings of the
        Fathers against the right of religious to teach owe their origin to the
        following fact. There existed, formerly, among certain presumptuous
        monks a mistaken idea, that, because they were monks, they, had a right
        to usurp the office of teachers. This assumption of authority, on their
        part, gave rise to considerable disturbance to the Church. We find this
        fact stated in <i>XVI quaest. I</i>, “Certain monks, bearing no
        commission from their own bishop, come to Constantinople, and cause
        confusion to arise in the church of that city.” This statement is fully
        corroborated in ecclesiastical history. The Fathers used every effort,
        both by arguments and decrees, to suppress these presumptuous monks.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But certain men of our own day, being “unlearned and unstable, wrest”
        these decrees, “as they do also the other Scriptures, to their own
        destruction” (2 Peter iii. 16). They, thus, fall into an opposite error
        to that which the Fathers strove to rectify. For, it is now asserted by
        the enemies of religion, that no religions has any right to exercise, or
        to undertake, the function of teaching; and that such an office. ought
        not to be open to religious orders. We will produce proofs that such a
        conclusion is utterly unfounded. We will then proceed to confute the
        arguments adduced in its support.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        First, we quote the authority of St. Jerome, who writes thus to Rusticus
        (the words are cited in <i>XVI, quaest. I</i>), “Lead such a life in
        your monastery, that you may deserve to become a cleric. Learn, for a
        long time, that which, hereafter, you may teach,” Again he continues in
        the following, chapter, “If the desire for the priesthood attract you,
        learn what you can teach.” From these words it is plain that monks may
        accept the office of teaching. The same fact is proved by the example of
        the Saints, who taught while living in religious orders. We read in the
        History of the Church, that St. Gregory of Nazianzen, a monk, was sent
        to Constantinople, in order to teach Holy Scripture. St. Damasus,
        likewise a monk; instructed his scholars, not only in Scripture, but in
        liberal arts, We have proof of this in the book
        <i>De miraculis beatae Virginis.</i> St. Jerome, also, although a monk,
        promises, in his prologue to the Bible, to instruct Paulinus, (also a
        monk), in Holy Scripture, and he exhorts him to its study. St.
        Augustine, knew, we are told, after he had founded the monastery in
        which he lived by the rule drawn up by the Apostles, wrote books and
        instructed the unlearned. In fact, some of the greatest Doctors of the
        Church—such as Sts. Gregory, Basil, Chrysostom, and many others—were
        religious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our Lord Himself has set the same example. For, as we read (Acts i. 1),
        “Jesus began to do and to teach.” The Gloss thus comments on these
        words, “Christ, by beginning to do and to teach, shows that a good
        teacher must do what he teaches.” The Gospels contain not only doctrine,
        but likewise counsels. Therefore, he who not only instructs others in
        the Evangelical precepts, but likewise himself observes the counsels (as
        do religious) are the most fit exponents of the Scriptures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, when a man dies, he passes away from the works belonging to the
        life which he quits. When he begins a new life, those works best beseem
        him which belong to the life on which he enters. Dionysius (2
        <i>cap. Eccles. Hierarch.</i>)shows that before Baptism, whereby man
        receives Divine life, he is incapable of any Divine operation; for life
        must precede work. In like manner a religious, by his vows, dies to, the
        world in order to live to God. Hence he is excluded from any share in
        secular business, such as commerce; but he is not forbidden to perform
        those Divine functions which require for their exercise life in God.
        Among such offices, is that of giving praise to God, which is only
        rightly done by those who have knowledge of sacred things. “The dead
        shall not praise you, O Lord... But we who live” (Ps. cxiii. 17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Another office from which religious are not excluded by their vows is
        that of teaching. On the contrary, being rendered by contemplation
        capable of understanding Divine things, they are certainly the most fit
        to impart them to others. Hence St. Gregory says (6, <i>Moral.</i>),
        “Those who contemplate with undistracted mind, drink in that knowledge,
        which they afterwards, when they are busied in speech, communicate to
        others.” Now religious are chiefly set apart for contemplation. Thus
        then we see, that religious become, by their vocation, more, rather than
        less, fit for teaching.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is ridiculous to assert, that a man is rendered incapable of
        teaching, because he has adopted a life which gives him more quiet and
        greater facility for study and learning. It would be as reasonable to
        say that a person is debarred from running, because he avoids the
        obstacles on his course. Now religious, as we have already seen,
        renounce by their vows all those things that chiefly disquiet the human
        heart. They, therefore, are the men beat adapted for study and for
        teaching. “Write wisdom (<i>i.e.</i>, Divine wisdom, according to the
        Gloss) upon the tables of your heart” (Prov. vii. 3). “The wisdom of a
        scribe, comes by his time of leisure and he who is less in action, shall
        receive wisdom (Eccli. xxxviii. 25).

        St. Jerome teaches, that the poor of Christ have a special claim to the
        knowledge of the Scripture. They know,” he says, (in
        <i>prol. Hebraicarum quaestionum, super Gen.</i>), “that we are poor and
        lowly, and do not own property nor accept alms. They know likewise that
        none can possess the treasure of Christ, i.e., the knowledge of the
        Scriptures, together with the riches of the world.” But it behoves those
        to teach, who have knowledge of the Scripture. Hence religious, who
        profess poverty, are peculiarly fitted to teach.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We have already pointed out that religious Orders may be founded for the
        prosecution of any work of charity. Now teaching is numbered amongst the
        spiritual works of mercy. Therefore a religious Order may be instituted
        for the purpose of teaching.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Certain religious Orders exist in the Church for the purpose of
        defending her against her enemies by force of arms, although there is no
        dearth of secular princes who are her official champions. Surely,
        warfare with sword and shield, must appear less consonant with a
        religious life, than is that spiritual combat waged against heresy by
        sacred writings, and suchlike intellectual weapons against heresy. It is
        of this spiritual armour that St. Paul says, “the weapons of our warfare
        are not carnal, but powerful through God,” etc. (2 Cor. x. 4). Why then
        may not Orders be lawfully founded for the purpose of teaching, and thus
        of defending the Church against her enemies, although she has other
        defenders who are not religious?

        We must remember, once more, that he who is fit for a greater thing in
        which a lesser is included ought to be accounted fit for the lesser,
        included in the greater one. Now a religious, even if he does not belong
        to an order founded for teaching, may, as we know (<i
          >De monachis, cap. XVI. quaest. I</i
        >), be promoted to the office of a prelate. As, therefore, the office of
        prelate is greater than that of a doctor (which is exercised by the
        masters who hold professorships in the schools), and, as a prelate is
        bound to be versed in sacred learning, it ought not to appear unseemly
        for a monk, by permission of lawful authority, to undertake the function
        of teaching.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        “Lesser goods may be sacrificed for greater ones,” the Gloss remarks on
        the words, “Go, and preach the kingdom of God” (Luke ix. 60); but the
        common welfare must always be preferred to any private advantage. Now
        while a monk is observing his rule in his cloister, he is working only
        for his personal advantage, i.e., for his own salvation. When, however,
        he is instructing many, his efforts redound to the profit of the whole
        Church. Hence it is not unseemly for a religious to live outside his
        monastery, in order, by permission of lawful authority, to exercise the
        office of teaching.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Neither is it a valid objection to urge, that monks ought not to act
        thus at present, while there is no dearth of secular teachers. For, the
        common welfare ought not to be sought by any means that may offer, but
        by the surest means possible. Now a plurality of teachers is greatly to
        the public advantage; for one will be well versed in subjects of which
        another is ignorant. Hence we read in Wisdom vi., 26, “The multitude of
        the wise is the welfare of the whole world.” “O that all the people
        might prophesy,” Moses cried out in his zeal for knowledge (Numb. xi.
        29). The Gloss remarks upon his words, that, “a faithful preacher would
        have all men utter the truth, which he himself does not suffice to
        declare.” And, in another place, the Gloss continues, in the same
        strain, “He” (i.e., Moses) “wished all men to prophesy; for he was not
        jealous of the gift bestowed upon him.”

        It matters little whether teaching be conveyed by the word of a master
        who is present, or by the writing of one who is absent. To quote St.
        Paul (2 Cor. x. 11), “Such as we are in word by epistles when absent;
        such we will be in deed when present.” Now no one has seen the libraries
        of books, composed by monks, for the instruction of the Church, doubts
        that they can teach by writing, when absent. Therefore, it is lawful for
        them to teach by word, when present.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We will now proceed to the easy task of confuting the objections brought
        against the right of religious to teach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The first argument, namely, that Our Lord gave a counsel to His
        disciples not to be masters, is, for several reasons, misleading. First,
        because the works of supererogation, concerning which the counsels are
        given, are rewarded by a peculiar recompense. “Whatever you spend over
        and above, I, at my return, will repay you” (Luke x. 33). These words
        are applied by the Gloss to works of supererogation. Hence it cannot be
        a counsel to abstain from works that are to be specially rewarded. Now
        teachers, like virgins, are promised a peculiar recompense. For we read
        in Daniel xii. 3, “Those who instruct” (ie., by word and example, as the
        Gloss explains) “many to justice, (shall shine) as stars for all
        eternity.” Hence there is no better ground for saying that it is a
        counsel to refrain from the function of teaching, than there is for
        maintaining that it is a matter of counsel to abstain from virginity, or
        from martyrdom.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, there cannot be a counsel which is contradictory either by
        another counsel, or by a precept. But teaching is a matter both of
        precept and of counsel. For our Lord said: “ Go, therefore, teach all
        nations” (Matt. viii. 19). St. Paul also writes: “You, who are
        spiritual, instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness” (Gal. vi. 1).
        Hence there can be no counsel forbidding us to teach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, our Lord willed that His Apostles, should themselves put, His
        counsels in practice, in order that by their example, others should be
        led to their observance. Hence St. Paul, giving the counsel of
        virginity, says, (1 Cor. vii. 7), “I wish all were as I myself am.” But
        the Apostles certainly did not observe the so-called counsel not to
        teach. For they themselves were sent forth to teach over the whole
        world. Thus, there can be no counsel against teaching.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is unreasonable to say that it is a counsel to abstain from those
        things that embrace the dignity of teaching. Solemnities pertaining to
        an office are not a cause of personal elation. Otherwise all men would
        be bound to shun them; since it is the duty of all to avoid pride.
        External insignia merely demonstrate the exalted character of an office.
        Hence as it is not imperfect for a priest to sit above a deacon, or to
        wear costly vestments, it can certainly be no imperfection to make use
        of the insignia pertaining to the scholastic office. Our Lord said of
        the Pharisees, “They love the first places at feasts” (Matt. iii. 6);
        but “He did not” (as the Gloss remarks) “forbid masters to occupy the
        first seats; he merely reproved the desire to have or not to have them.”
        It is truly absurd to say that, though it be not a counsel to refrain
        from teaching, it is a counsel to refuse the name of master. There
        cannot be a counsel or a precept regarding what is not in ourselves but
        in another. To teach or not to teach is our own concern, and we have
        shown that it is not a matter of counsel. But the fact that we are
        called master or doctor, is no affair of ours. It regards those who give
        us these names. Therefore, to refrain from being called master, cannot
        be a counsel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Further, as names are used to mean certain things, it is foolish to say
        that a name is forbidden, while the thing signified by it is allowed.
        Likewise, the observance of the Counsels was primarily the duty of the
        Apostles. It is only through their instrumentality that they are
        observed by any other persons. Now the name of Master cannot be
        forbidden by any counsel, since the Apostles called themselves both
        masters and teachers. “I am appointed a preacher and an apostle—I say
        the truth and do not lie—a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and truth” (1
        Tim. ii. 7). “In which I am appointed a preacher and an apostle, and a
        teacher of the Gentiles” (2 Tim. i. 11).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It remains to be considered that our Lord’s words: “Do not be called
        Rabbi” are not a counsel but a precept, by which all men are bound. He
        did not wish to forbid the office of teaching, but the sin of ambition.
        Neither, when He added, “ nor masters,” did He forbid us to teach, nor
        yet to bear the name of master. What His words signify, according to the
        Gloss, is: “Do not desire to be called masters.” He forbids the desire
        of place. He does not forbid all such desire, but only such as is
        inordinate, and therefore unlawful. This has been proved both by a
        foregoing quotation from the Gloss, and also by Christ’s words about the
        Pharisees, “They love the first places,” etc. Nevertheless, these words,
        may (says the Gloss) bear another interpretation. If our Lord forbids us
        to be called by the name of master and teacher, He equally prohibits our
        bearing the name of Father; for we have one Father who is in Heaven and
        one Master Christ. “For God” (as the Gloss says) “is by nature both our
        Father and our Master.” A man may be called father to signify his
        tenderness; and master to denote the authority which he exercises. That
        which our Lord forbids is that to any man should be attributed either
        right over physical or spiritual life, or plenitude of wisdom. Hence the
        commentary of the Gloss on this prohibition of Christ is as follows: “Do
        not be called masters, as assuming to yourselves what is due to God. Do
        not you call others Rabbi, as paying to man Divine homage.” And in
        another place we find the following commentary on the same passage: “A
        man may be called father, as a mark of respect to his age, but not to
        denote that he is the author of life.” In the same way, a man may be
        addressed as master, meaning that he is united to the true master, and
        that we reverence Him whose commission he holds. But, if our Lord had
        absolutely forbidden, either by counsel or precept, the name of master
        to be given to men, the Fathers of the Church would certainly not have
        allowed monastic superiors to be called Abbots, a word equivalent to
        father. If the name father were forbidden, how could the Vicar of
        Christ, who ought to set an example of perfection, be called Pope or
        father? Again, both St. Augustine and St. Jerome frequently addressed
        bishops as popes or fathers. Hence it is the height of folly to pretend
        that the words, “Do not be called Rabbi,” are to be understood as a
        counsel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, even granted that these words were intended by our Lord as a
        counsel, it does not follow that all such as are perfect would be bound
        to observe it. For, those who make profession of the state of perfection
        are not under an obligation to obey all the counsels, but only such as
        they, by their vows, are bound to observe. Were it otherwise, the
        Apostles, who were in the state of perfection, would have been bound to
        perform the work of supererogation which St. Paul practised in taking no
        stipend from the churches in which he preached; and they would have
        sinned had they acted otherwise (1 Cor ix.). Were all religious equally
        bound to observe every counsel, and to perform every work of
        supererogation, great confusion would ensue, and the distinctions which
        now differentiate the various Orders would be abolished. Those who are
        in a state of perfection are not bound to observe all the Counsels, but
        only those to which their vows oblige them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The argument; that the office of a religious is not to teach, but to
        mourn, carries no weight. St. Jerome meant, by the words quoted, that
        the chief duty of a monk, as a monk, is to do penance, not to teach. He
        thereby shows that a monk is not, by virtue of his profession, bound to
        teach; and he rebukes the presumption of those religious who claimed the
        function of teaching as their special prerogative. He writes in the same
        sense in his epistle to Vigilantius. But it does not, by any means,
        follow that, although a monk has not the office of teaching, it may not
        at some future time be imposed upon him. It is not the duty of a
        subdeacon to read the Gospel, but that does not prove that this office
        will never fall to his share, as Gratian points out (<i
          >XVI quaest. I, Superiori</i
        >). St. Jerome wished to emphasise the distinction between the person of
        a monk and that of a cleric, and to show, that certain duties were
        peculiar to the office of each. One function belongs to a monk, as a
        monk; another to an ecclesiastic as an ecclesiastic. The duty peculiar
        to a monk, by reason of his state of life, is to mourn for his own sins
        and those of others. The task especially allotted to an ecclesiastic is
        that of preaching to and instructing the people. This distinction
        appears still more clearly in another chapter of Gratian, in which be
        treats of the teaching conveyed by preaching, which is the, special duty
        of prelates, not of scholastic teaching in which they are not specially
        well practised. Hence in raising this objection against the right of
        religious to teach, our adversaries are begging the question.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, even supposing that it be not lawful for a monk to teach, that does
        not prove that it is not right for Canons regular to teach; since these
        are counted as ecclesiastics. St. Augustine, in his sermon
        <i>De communi vita clericorm</i> (quoted <i>XII quaest. I, Nemo</i>),
        says, speaking of Canons regular: “He who possesses, or desires to
        possess private property and to live on his own means, virtually
        renounces his life with me, and is not a cleric.” This passage shows
        that those who lived under the rule of this Saint, in the practice of
        poverty, were recognised as clerics. Although St. Augustine withdrew the
        assertion that no one was a cleric who retained private property, he
        never contradicted his words, that those who lived under him without
        possessing anything of their own, were clerics (see cap.
        <i>Certe ego sum, quaest. eadem</i>).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        When canons regular and monks are said to be equally counted as
        religious, it is to be understood, that they are equal in observance of
        the points common to all religious Orders, <i>i.e.,</i> the renunciation
        of private property, abstention from commerce or from legal business,
        and the like. Unless this be made clear, it might be thought, that
        canons regular were bound to certain observances, <i>e.g.</i> the disuse
        of wearing linen apparel, to which monks are bound. Even if it be not
        lawful for monks to teach, this function is certainly permissible to
        religious belonging to Orders instituted for the purpose; just as it is
        lawful for the Knights Templar to bear arms, although the use of armour
        is forbidden to monks.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The objection, that the exercise of the teaching office is contrary to
        the religious vows, is, on several accounts, ill-founded. Religious do
        not renounce the world in the sense that they can make no use of secular
        things. They renounce a worldly life, <i>i.e.</i> they are not allowed,
        by their vows, to be employed in secular affairs. Even among men, living
        in the world, there are some who are not of the world, <i>ie.</i> who
        are disengaged from temporal interests. But religious do not act
        contrary to their vows, by making use of the riches or even, at times,
        of the pleasures of the world. Otherwise occasional feasting would for
        them be a mortal sin. Which is, of course, out of the question. If it be
        not against the religious vows to make use of secular riches or
        pleasure, why should it be contrary to these vows, to make use of
        worldly honour?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Not only religious, but all men are, in one sense, bound to renounce the
        world, as we learn from the words of St. John already quoted (1 Jn. ii.
        15), “If any man love the world the charity of the Father is not in him,
        for all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh and the
        concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life.” The Gloss says that
        “lovers of the world have nothing except these three things, viz. the
        lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, from
        which sources spring every vice.” Hence we see, that it is not riches or
        pleasure simply, which are said to belong to the world, but the
        inordinate desire for them; and that not honour, but ambition, is
        forbidden, not to religious alone, but to all mankind. “The pride of
        life,” says the Gloss, “signifies worldly ambition.” But, even if honour
        be simply understood as belonging to the world, this would not be true
        of every kind of honour, but only of such as consists of worldly things.
        The honour of the priesthood cannot be said to belong to the world.
        Neither can the honour given to a teacher, when the teaching which is
        honoured concerns spiritual things. Thus, if religious do not, by their
        vows, renounce the priesthood, they need not renounce the office of
        teaching. Again, it is untrue to say that the act of teaching is an
        honour. It is the teacher’s office which is honourable. And, even if
        religious renounce all honours, they cannot renounce all honourable
        functions; otherwise they would renounce all those works of mercy which
        are most deserving of honour. “Honour,” to quote Aristotle, “is the
        reward of virtue” (<i>I Ethic.</i>). That the devil deceives some do men
        and fills them with pride on account of their office as teachers, is no
        more reason for refusing the work of teaching than it is for declining
        to do any virtuous actions. For, as St. Augustine says, “Pride
        insinuates itself into good works, to make them worthless.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The assertion, that, religious profess perfect humility is absolutely
        untrue. They make no vow of humility. Their vow is of obedience. Neither
        humility, nor any other virtue, is a matter of vow. Acts of virtue,
        being a matter of precept, are a necessity. Vows are only concerned with
        that which is voluntary. Again, no one can make a vow of perfect
        humility, or of perfect charity. For perfection is a gift of God; it
        does not depend upon our will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Granted, however, that religious were bound to perfect humility, that
        would not hinder their receiving certain honours. The possession of
        property is certainly contrary to perfect poverty, but the acceptance of
        honours is not contrary to humility. For pride consists not in
        possessing honours, but in being unduly elated by them. Hence St.
        Bernard says (in <i>Libro de consideratione</i>), “Even in the time of
        the Sovereign Pontiff there is no jewel brighter than humility! He who
        is in a more exalted position than others, becomes, by humility,
        superior to himself.” And in the book of Sirach iii. 20 we read: “The
        greater you are, the more you should humble yourself in all things.” Who
        would dare to say that St. Gregory became less humble by being promoted
        to the highest ecclesiastical honour? Moreover, as we have said, the
        function of teaching is not an honour. Therefore, objections brought
        against it, on that ground, are, worthless.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Another argument brought against the right of religious to teach is that
        Dionysius distinguishes monks as apart from deacons, priests, and
        bishops. We know from ecclesiastical history that the monks of the
        primitive Church, until the time of Eusebius, Zozimus, and Siricius,
        were not clerics (<i>XVI, quaest I, Superiori</i>). Therefore, as it is
        of these monks that Dionysius speaks, we cannot, from his words, come to
        any conclusion about the monks who were bishops, prieds, or deacons. Any
        difficulty on the point, arises from misunderstanding of the words of
        Dionysius. This author calls the Sacraments of the Church sacred
        actions. Baptism he terms cleansing and illumination. Confirmation and
        the Blessed Eucharist he names perfecting (IV cap.
        <i>Eccl. hierarch.</i>). Now it is not lawful for any, save bishops,
        priests or deacons, to perform these sacred functions. Teaching in the
        schools, however, is not one of the holy rites, or sacred actions,
        whereof he speaks; otherwise it could be undertaken by none save by a
        priest, or a deacon. Again, ordained monks can consecrate the Body of
        our Lord, a power pertaining to none but priests. Why then should they
        not exercise the function of teaching, for which no Orders are required?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is further urged, that, as no monk can be employed in ecclesiastical
        duties, and yet keep his monastic rule aright, much less can he combine
        the work of teaching with regular observance. Our answer is that, as we
        have already shown, this objection does not hold good with regard to the
        essentials of religious life. For these can be practised by those who
        hold ecclesiastical office. As for such religious observances as
        silence, vigils, and the like, it is shown in another chapter, that, “he
        who is obliged to serve daily in the ministry of the Church, practises
        the strictness of his monastic life.” But it is not unseemly if anyone
        neglect regular observance for the sake of performing an action such as
        teaching, which is for the common good. Thus religious who are called to
        the office of prelates, sometimes while they are still in their
        monastery, accept a dispensation for such reason. There are also
        religious living in their cloister in strict observance, who exercise
        the function of teaching, because it is enjoined by their rule.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The seventh objection to the right of a religious to teach is, that by
        so doing, be oversteps his measure, or, as the Gloss says, goes further
        than is permitted to him. Now when we say that a thing is permitted, we
        mean that it is not forbidden by any law. Hence if a religious do
        something not prohibited by his rule, even though the thing be not
        mentioned in the Rule, he does not overstep his measure. Otherwise,
        religious who live under a mitigated rule, would have no right to
        undertake the customs and usages of a more perfect life. Such a
        prohibition would be opposed to the sentiments of St. Paul (Philipp.
        iii.), who says that, forgetting the things that were behind, he
        stretched forth himself to those that were before. We must further
        remember that some religious are, by the rule of their Order, destined
        for teaching. To them, of course, the foregoing objection cannot apply.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The suggestion, that in one community of religious there ought not to be
        two teachers is manifestly unfair. Religious, as we have shown, are not
        less humble than are seculars; and their position in the office of
        teaching ought not to be worse than that of seculars. But, if the
        suggestion, to which we have alluded, were carried out in practice,
        religious would have far less chance of success in the profession of
        teaching, than would be the case with seculars. For a whole multitude of
        religious would have no more opportunity of promotion to a professorship
        than any individual layman would have who studied alone. Hence the
        progress of religious would be seriously impeded. We may compare their
        position to that of wrestlers, whose spirit in their match would be
        damped, if the prize for which they strove were withdrawn. For, as
        Aristotle says (<i>III Ethics</i>), “The bravest in the fight are those
        who despise cowardice, and honour courage.” In like manner, it is a
        hindrance to a student if the chance of a professorship, the prize for
        which he is working, be denied him. It would be regarded as a penalty
        for some offence if a man who, by his learning, had gained a right to
        some scholastic post, were not allowed to occupy it; and in the same
        way, a religious would be punished for being a religious, were obstacles
        placed in the way of his gaining a professorship. Nothing could be more
        unjust, than thus to punish a man for leading a meritorious life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The authority of St. James, “be ye not many masters my brethren,”
        brought forward in support of this suggestion, applies as much to laymen
        as to religious. For, in the New Testament, all Christians are called
        brethren; and the Church is called a society of Christians. Neither is a
        multitude of religious teachers more stringently forbidden by the
        authority cited than is a multiplicity of secular teachers. For, as St.
        Augustine says, “by many teachers is meant teachers teaching contrary
        doctrines. Many who teach alike are but as one teacher.” Hence St.
        James’ prohibition is directed against divergence of doctrine, not
        against plurality of masters. His words may also be understood in their
        literal sense, as meaning that discrimination must be exercised in the
        choice of teachers; that only such men must be chosen for this office as
        are discreet and well versed in the Scriptures. But, as the Gloss
        remarks, there are not many such to be found. In another passage, the
        Gloss says that “they who are not learned in the word of faith should
        not be allowed to teach; lest true preachers be hindered in their work.”
        Or, again, the words of St. James which have been quoted may apply to
        masters in the sense of prelates of the Church. For it is forbidden for
        one bishop to govern several churches; or for several bishops to rule
        over one church. Hence the Gloss says, “Do not desire to be masters,
        i.e. prelates (who alone are ecclesiastical masters) in many churches;
        or to have many masters in one church.” For, he who teaches in a
        community is not a master of a church, although the community to which
        he belongs may be called a church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We can answer the second argument of our adversaries by saying that,
        although there be several masters in one community, they do not rule, as
        a captain guides a ship, or a queen-bee reigns in a hive. Each master
        presides over his own school. Hence the words of St. Jerome (“among bees
        there is one queen”) cannot be understood in the sense in which our
        opponents use them. They only mean, that there should not be many
        masters in the same school.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the third argument brought against a multiplicity of religious
        teachers, we reply, that the fact that there may be several religious
        houses, each containing many masters, does not debar laymen from the
        profession of teaching. There are not always in a community of religious
        enough men capable of teaching. Again, the fact that in any diocese
        there may be a sufficiency of teachers does not exclude seculars from
        this function. Religious and laymen ought to be judged on the same
        lines; and the most capable masters, be they secular or religious, ought
        to be selected without distinction of person. We need not fear that the
        Holy Scriptures will fall into contempt on account of a multiplicity of
        teachers to expound them. There is more danger of this being the case
        when the professors of Scripture are few in number. Hence there is no
        reason why the number of teachers should be limited; or why, through
        fear of their being too many, men capable of teahing should be excluded
        from that office.

        THOSE who are hostile to religious make a malicious effort to prove that
        they ought not, in anything pertaining to study, to have dealings with
        seculars. Their object in thus acting, is to place obstacles in the path
        of such religious as are employed in teaching, if they cannot entirely
        hinder them in the exercise of that function. They adduce several
        authorities in support of their principles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        First they quote the following words of
        <i>xvii, cap. vii, In nova actione</i>: “Those engaged in the same work,
        ought not to differ in profession. This was forbidden by the law of
        Moses, “You shall not plough with an ox and an ass together” (Deut.
        xxii), which means “You shall not associate in one office men of
        different professions.” The reason given is, “they whose aims and,
        desires are dissimilar, cannot unite nor coalesce.” Since then laymen
        and religious differ in profession, they ought not to be joined in the
        teaching office. Again, St. Augustine says, that every man ought to
        adhere to such a manner of life as befits him. Now it does not appear
        seemly, that the same man should, belong at one and the same time to a
        secular and to a religious establishment. For, the members of one
        institute cannot imitate the usages of the other. Hence a religious,
        belonging to his own community, should not be a member of a secular
        college.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, a legal statute has ruled that, without a dispensation, the same
        man shall not belong to two lay associations. Much less then ought a
        religious, belonging to his own community, to be a member of a secular
        establishment. Again, all who belong to any society are bound to obey
        its rules. Now religious cannot conform to regulations drawn up for lay
        professors and scholars; nor can they promise to abide by those
        ordinances which laymen bind themselves to observe; nor to take the
        oaths which seculars take, for religious are not their own masters, but
        live under authority. Hence they cannot belong to secular societies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, the malicious enemies of religious, in their desire to exclude them
        from any intercourse with seculars, strive, in default of legitimate
        arguments, to accomplish their purpose by calumny. They maintain that
        religious are a source of offence and scandal to the world; and they
        exhort their fellows to avoid all communion with them. They quote the
        words of St. Paul (Rom. xvi. 17), “Now I beseech you, brethren, to, mark
        them who cause dissensions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which
        you have learned, and to avoid them.” Religious are accused of living
        in, idleness. Therefore, according to the words of St. Paul (2 Thes.
        iii. 6) they ought to be shunned by good men. For, the Apostle says: “We
        charge you, brethren, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that you
        withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly, and not
        according to the tradition which they have received of us.” St. Paul
        goes on to speak of the manual labour practised by the Apostles. He then
        continues, “For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us.” He
        concludes his exhortation by the following command: “If any man obey not
        our word,” (i.e. our injunction to manual labour), “by this epistle,
        note that man; and do not keep company with him, that he may be
        ashamed.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Religious are further denounced by their enemies as being the source of
        all the evils which are to flood the world in the latter days. Hence
        they must be shunned by all men. For, St. Paul, writing to Timothy, (2
        Tim. iii), gives a most emphatic order on this head. “Know,” he says,
        that in the last days there shall come dangerous times. Men shall be
        lovers of themselves, covetous, haughty, etc., having an appearance
        indeed, of goodness (or of religion, as the Gloss says), but denying the
        power thereof. Now these avoid.” But, as in the same chapter St. Paul
        says, “Evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse, erring and
        driving into error,” so these defamers of religious, not satisfied with
        calumny, try to make void the authority of the Apostle, saying that, not
        even at his bidding, are they bound to admit religious to their society.
        For, according to civil law, there is no obligation which can compel
        them to permit religious to associate with them, since society is
        established on the basis of free will. Hence the Apostolic authority is
        limited to ecclesiastical affairs. St. Paul himself said (2 Cor. x. 13),
        “We will not glory beyond our measure, but according to the measure of
        the rule which God has measured to us.” Now ecclesiastical affairs
        include the collation of benefices, the administration of the
        Sacraments, and the like, but not association in studies. Hence secular
        students are not, by Apostolic authority, bound to admit, religious to
        their society.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, power is committed to the ministers of the church, not “unto
        destruction, but unto edification” (2, Cor. xiii. 10). Hence as the
        enemies of religious consider that they have proofs that union between
        religious and seculars would be “unto destruction,” they hold, that the
        authority of the Apostles cannot compel them to form such an union.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This opinion, however, is censurable, mistaken and ill-founded. It
        deserves censure inasmuch as it detracts from that unity in the Church
        which, as St. Paul says (Rom. xii. 5), is based on the fact that “We,
        being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of
        another.” The Gloss interprets these words as meaning, that “we are
        members one of another, since we are of service to each other, and are
        in need of the assistance of one another.” This is true of all men
        alike; neither the greater, nor the lesser amongst us being excluded.
        Hence whosoever hinders one man from serving another, as far as he be
        able, impairs the unity of the Church. Now the work of teaching is one
        adapted to religious. St. Paul mentions this, saying, “he who teaches in
        doctrine.” Thereby the apostle means, says the Gloss, “He who has the
        gift of teaching, should, by his instruction, prove himself a member of
        another.” Hence it is a violation of ecclesiastical unity to hinder
        religious either from teaching others or from learning from them. It is
        likewise an infraction of charity. For, as Aristotle says (<i>Ethics</i>
        viii. and x.), “friendship is based on intercourse and by it is
        fostered.” These words are borne out by the saying of Solomon, “A man
        amiable in society, shall be more friendly than a brother” (Prov. xviii.
        24). Anyone, therefore, who hinders intercourse, in scholastic matters
        between laymen and religious weakens charity and sows the seed of
        quarrels and dissensions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, obstacles thrown in the way of such intercourse, will tend to
        impede the progress made by students. In all social matters, the
        companionship of others is of great advantage. “A brother that is helped
        by his brother is like a strong city” says Solomon (Prov. xviii. 19).
        “It is better, therefore, that two should be together than one: for they
        have the advantage of their society” (Eccles. iv. 9). But Wis,
        especially, in study, that society is of use; for among many students
        some will know or understand that, of which others are ignorant. Hence
        Aristotle (I <i>Caeli et Mundi</i>) says “that the ancient philosophers,
        at divers meetings, investigated the truth concerning the heavenly
        bodies.” The exclusion then any class of men from the society of other
        students is a manifest injury to the studies of all. This applies,
        especially, to the exclusion of religious, who are peculiarly well
        adapted to make progress in learning, since, by their state of life,
        they are not distracted by worldly anxieties. “He who is less in action,
        shall receive wisdom” (Eecles. xxxviii. 25).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        By excluding religious from studying in common with laymen, an injury is
        committed against the community of faith, which is called Catholic
        because it ought to be one. Those who do not associate with each other
        by agreeing on religious matters, may easily end by teaching different,
        and even contradictory doctrines. St Paul says of himself (Gal. ii, 1),
        “Then, after fourteen years, I went up I again to Jerusalem with
        Barnabas, taking Titus also with me. And I went up according to
        revelation, and communicated with them the Gospel which I preach among
        the Gentiles, but apart to them who seemed to be something: lest perhaps
        I should run, or had run, in vain.” We learn from the
        <i>Decretals</i> (<i>distinct. XV.cap. canones</i>), that Councils began
        to be convoked in the time of Constantine. Before that period, there
        was, on account of frequent and violent persecutions, very little
        facility for the instruction of the faithful; and, as bishops had no
        opportunity for meeting to debate together, the Christian religion was
        torn by many heresies. This fact proves, that there is great danger of
        schism in matters of doctrine, when the preachers of the faith are not
        able to assemble for purposes of discussion. Hence any attempt to
        exclude religious from intercourse with other teachers and students is
        highly to be condemned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The reason given for such an exclusion, is likewise ill-founded, being
        opposed to Apostolic doctrine which cannot err. St, Peter (1 Pet. iv.
        10), writes in these terms: “As every man has received grace, minister
        the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.”
        The Gloss thus comments on this passage: “The Apostle signifies by the
        word “grace” any gift of the Holy Spirit which may be used for the
        assistance of others, in things either temporal or spiritual. He
        exemplifies his meaning by the words which follow. “If any man speak,
        let him speak as the words of God.” The Gloss adds, “If any man knows
        how to speak, let him attribute his knowledge not to himself, but to
        God.” Let him stand in fear, lest he teach anything contrary to the will
        of God, the authority of Scripture, or the good of his brethren; or,
        lest he be silent, when he ought to speak.” Hence the assertion that
        Religious and laymen ought not mutually to communicate their gift of
        knowledge is patently, opposed to the teaching of the Apostles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, we read in Ecclesiast. xxxiii. 18, “See that I have not laboured
        for myself only, but for all that seek discipline.” These words, as the
        Gloss observes, apply to the teachers of the Church, who, by their
        writings and instruction, profit not themselves alone, but others also.
        The wise man, in the text that we have quoted, says, that he has
        laboured for all men, without exception. Therefore, both religious and
        secular teachers, ought, by their teaching, to labour for the benefit of
        all their brethren, whether laymen or religious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As the body is composed of several members, so in the Church there exist
        divers offices. This comparison we find in the first Epistle of St. Paul
        to the Corinthians (xii.). Now as in the physical body there are eyes,
        so in the mystical body of the Church there are teachers. Hence the
        Gloss understands the text in the Gospel of St. Matthew (xviii. 9): “If
        your eye scandalises you” etc., to refer to ecclesiastical doctors and
        counsellors. Physical eyesight is useful to the whole body alike, and
        one limb subserves another in its functions. For, as St. Paul says (1
        Cor. xii. 21), “the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not your help;
        nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you.” Therefore,
        everyone who undertakes the office of teaching must perform it for the
        benefit of all men, of whatsoever condition they may be. Thus religious
        must assist laymen; and laymen must help religious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, any person who is competent to perform some special function has
        a right to be admitted to the society of those who are selected for the
        exercise of that function. For, an association means the union of men,
        gathered together for the accomplishment of some specific work. Thus,
        all soldiers have a right to associate with one another in the same
        army; for an army is nothing but a society of men, banded together for
        the purpose of fighting. Hence religious of a military order do not
        exclude from their society secular soldiers, and vice versa. Now an
        association of study is a society established with the object of
        teaching and of learning; and as not only laymen, but also religious,
        have a right to teach and to learn, there can be no doubt that both
        these classes may lawfully unite in one society.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The objection made to intercourse between seculars and religious, on
        matters bearing on study and teaching, are altogether frivolous. They
        are based on wholly untenable grounds; and they only serve to show the
        ignorance of their authors. For, as we have already said, a society
        means a union of men, assembled together for one and the same purpose.
        Hence as everything ought to be judged with regard to the end for which
        it is ordained, the different societies which exist ought to be
        distinguished and judged according to the purpose for which they are
        formed. Aristotle, (VIII <i>Ethics</i>) classifies different
        “communications”. By this term he means associations formed for divers
        objects, wherein the members hold communication one with the other. The
        Philosopher distinguishes friendships according to these communications.
        He refers to the friendship of those brought up together, or that based
        on commercial transactions, or the friendship of men engaged in the same
        business, Hence arises the distinction between public and private
        societies. A public society is that wherein men assemble for purposes
        connected with the commonweal. Thus fellow citizens or compatriots form
        a public society and become one city or one kingdom. A private society
        is one established by a few persons for some private end. Thus two or
        three enter into partnership in a mercantile negotiation. Now each of
        these classes of society may be either temporary or perpetual. Sometimes
        a number of men, or only two or three individuals, band together in a
        perpetual society. This, is the case with those, who, when they become
        citizens of some city, form an association, choosing that city for their
        dwelling-place for ever. They thus establish a political society. Again,
        there may be a perpetual private society, formed between husband and
        wife, or master and slave, based upon the durable nature of the tie
        binding together the members of such a society. This is called an
        economical society. But, when men associate in order to engage in some
        temporary business, as, for example, to hold a fair, they form a
        temporary and public society. Or, when two friends are engaged in the
        management of the same inn, the society which they establish is private,
        and at at the same time temporary.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now these various classes of association, must be judged by different
        standards. To apply the name of association or society indiscriminately
        to all is to prove one’s own ignorance. For this, reason, we shall have
        no difficulty in answering the objections brought at the association of
        seculars and religious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We are told, first of all, that “men of different professions ought not
        to be associated in the same offices.” Then words are quoted, “you shall
        not join together men of different professions.” This objection is
        perfectly true if it be understood to mean that men of different
        professions should not be associated in matters upon which they differ.
        Hence laymen and clerics should not be associated in ecclesiastical
        matters. Therefore the following words are found before the words just
        quoted: “A bishop ought not to have a lay vicar; and the clergy ought
        not to be judged in lay courts of justice.” For the same reason,
        religious cannot associate with laymen in commercial and mercantile
        transactions, in which religious are forbidden to take part. “No man
        being a soldier of God entangleth himself with secular businesses” (2
        Tim. ii. 4). But, as we have seen, the exercise of teaching and of
        learning concerns both seculars and religious. Hence there is no reason
        against religious being associated with laymen in scholastic, affairs.
        For, men of different conditions, who, agree in unity of faith, form the
        body of the Church. “There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither
        bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in
        Christ Jesus” (Gal. iii. 28). It is objected that, although in an
        association of laymen and religious there are some points common, to
        both classes there are likewise some on which they differ. Thus, there
        may be a purely secular society, formed of members whose interests are
        limited to secular affairs. Or, there may be an exclusively religious
        institute, of which the system is directed towards the formation of the
        religious life. There is, however, one, point which is common both to
        laymen sad to religious. For, religious and seculars have this in
        common, viz., that. they belong to the society of the one Church of
        Christ, by that agreement in one faith whereby the unity of the Church
        is made perfect. Hence as teaching and learning are functions pertaining
        alike to seculars and religious, an association of study ought not to be
        known as exclusively either a lay or a religious college; but, rather,
        as a college including both seculars and religious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The objection that no one can belong to two associations is, for three
        reasons, untenable. First, because a part cannot be numerically
        accounted as opposed to the whole. A private society is part of a public
        society, as a house is part of a city. The fact that a man forms part of
        a family causes him to form part of a city, which is composed of many
        families. Nevertheless, he does not, on this account, belong to two
        distinct associations. Now as an association of studies is a public
        association, a man who forms part of a private society (be it secular or
        religious), wherein a few students meet together for the purposes of
        study, belongs on this very account to a general scholastic association.
        But he does not, for this reason, belong to two associations. Again,
        there is no law to prohibit a man from belonging to some public,
        perpetual association, and at the same time from forming part of a
        public or private temporary society. Thus, a man who belongs to some
        civic society may likewise form part of a military association; and the
        member of a family, may be associated with others in an inn. Now an
        institute of studies is a temporary, not a perpetual, association. For
        men attend it, not as a permanent residence, but they go and come at
        their own convenience. Hence there is no reason why a man belonging to a
        perpetual society, such as a religious, order, should not also attend a
        scholastic establishment. The third reason which stultifies the
        objection to the admission of religious to secular colleges is that this
        objection applies the particular to the general. The assertion, that a
        man cannot, belong to two associations was originally formulated about
        ecclesiastical societies. Thus, a man cannot be a canon in two churches,
        without a dispensation or a legitimate reason. We read (<i
          >XXI quaest. I</i
        >), “From this date, no cleric shall be attached to two churches.” But
        this rule does not apply to other associations. For, the same man can be
        a citizen of two cities. Therefore, as a scholastic association is not
        an ecclesiastical society, there is no reason why a man belonging to a
        religious or secular association, should not also be a member of a
        scholastic society.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The fourth reasoin given for the exclusion of religious from association
        with secular students is that religious cannot either teach or study
        without the authorisation and permission of their superiors, who have
        the power to absolve their subjects from their oaths and other
        engagements in order to enable them to belong to such an association.
        Now we must remember that, as the perfection of a whole consists in the
        union of its parts, a whole cannot exist unless its parts agree. Hence
        any decrees drawn up for the welfare of a state and city ought to be
        formulated with a view to the advantage of all its members. Any statutes
        which would hinder the unity of a commonwealth ought to be abolished.
        For laws are established in order to preserve the concord of a state and
        not to promote internal dissension. In the same way, there ought not to
        exist in any scholastic association statutes which do not suit all
        students alike. The words of the Apostle, (Rom. xvi. 17), “Now I beseech
        you, brethren,” etc., quoted by our opponents in support of their
        objections, are no argument on their side. First because the words of
        St. Paul do not apply to religious, but to heretics, and to schismatics.
        This is clearly shown in the text, wherein St. Paul warns the Romans to
        avoid such as cause dissensions “contrary to the doctrine which they had
        learned,” learned that is, as the Gloss explains, “from the true
        Apostles.” Those against whom St. Paul gave this warning, were men who
        strove to impose the Jewish law upon the Gentiles. Again the words (2
        Thes. iii. 6), “We charge you, brethren,” etc., were not uttered against
        religious, but against men who passed their time in idleness and
        misdeeds. Of these St. Paul says, “we have heard there are some among
        you who walk disorderly, working not at all, but curiously meddling,” or
        as, the Gloss says, “providing for their necessities by iniquitous
        means.” Again the words (2 Tim. iii. 1), “Know also this,” etc., were
        written not to religious, but to heretics, “blasphemers” as St. Paul
        calls them, “who by their heresy blaspheme God” (Gloss). “As Jannes and
        Manbres resisted Moses so these also (i.e. heretics) resist the truth,”
        continues the Apostle, “ men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the
        faith.” It is true that he says, that the heretics of whom he speaks,
        had an appearance indeed of godliness,” ie., of religion; but religion
        in this passage signifies <i>latria</i>, which makes a profession of
        faith. In this sense, it is, as St. Augustine says, (X
        <i>De civitate Dei</i>), equivalent to piety.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But even granted that all or some religious were as infamous as certain
        men consider them to be, that would be ho reason for excluding them from
        intercourse with others. The Gloss, referring to the passage of St. Paul
        (1 Cor. v.,), concerning the man guilty of. incest, wherein he bids the
        Corinthians not so much as to eat with such an one, observes that, “the
        Apostle’s words, ‘if anyone that is named a brother,’ show that men are
        not to condemn each other rashly and carelessly, but that it is only
        after judgment has been pronounced that any sinner is to be excluded
        from communion with the Church. If such a sinner cannot be judicially
        excommunicated, he must be tolerated.” We have no right to exclude any
        man from the society of his fellows, unless he be, by his own
        confession, found guilty of some crime, or be denounced and convicted by
        some secular or ecclesiastical tribunal. Hence a man may not be
        condemned on suspicion, or by someone usurping the office of judge. He
        must be tried, accused and convicted according to the law of God,
        interpreted by the Church. Hence even were religious as reprobate as
        they are said to be, they ought not to be excluded from intercourse with
        the laity, unless they have been brought to judgment, and have been
        condemned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The attempt to derogate from the authority of the Apostles, is not only
        based on false premises, but is closely akin to heresy. For we find in
        the <i>Decretals</i> (<i>dist. XXII. cap. Omnes</i>) the following
        passage: “Whoever endeavours to wrest from the Roman Church the
        privilege bequeathed to her by the supreme head of all the churches is
        undoubtedly guilty of heresy.” And again, “ He acts contrary to faith,
        who acts against her who is the Mother of the Faith.” Now Christ granted
        to the Roman Church the privilege of being obeyed by all, as He Himself
        is obeyed, in order, as says St. Cyril, bishop of Alexandria (<i
          >II Thesaurorum</i
        >), “that we may continue to be members under our Head, the Roman
        Pontiff, seated on the throne of the Apostles. From him must we learn
        what we are to believe and uphold. We are bound to revere him, and to
        entreat him for all things. To him alone does it belong to rebuke and to
        correct and to unloose, in the place of Him who has established him. To
        none other has this power been given, but to him alone, before whom all
        men do, by the divine command, abase their heads, and who is, by all the
        princes of the world, obeyed as if he were our Lord Jesus Christ
        Himself.” Hence it is clear that anyone who maintains that the Pope need
        not be obeyed is a heretic.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The objection that, according to law, no one can be forced to join an
        association against his will, applies only to a private society,
        established by two or three members. But a man can be compelled to form
        part of a public association, which cannot exist without the consent of
        authority. Thus, a prince may force the inhabitants of a certain city to
        accept an individual as their fellow-citizen; and an ecclesiastical
        society can be compelled to accept a man as a canon, or a brother. Hence
        as any general scholastic association is, in a certain sense, a society,
        any man may be obliged, by the authority of a superior, to belong to it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The assertion that the Apostolic authority is limited to ecclesiastical
        affairs, is false. The president of a republic is bound to provide food
        for those over whom he rules, and to undertake the proper education and
        training of the young (<i>X Ethic</i>). He is likewise obliged to
        supervise the legislation of his republic, and to establish rules for
        the well-being of the citizens (<i>I Ethic</i>). Thus we see that the
        legislation concerning education is one of the duties of the president
        of a republic. It must, therefore, come under the authority of the
        Apostolic See, by which the whole Church is governed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The last objection is founded on an absolute falsehood. The association
        of religious with the laity in matters concerning education is not
        intended for the destruction, but rather for the advancement, of
        learning. Hence there can be no possible doubt that, by the authority of
        the Apostolic See, seculirs may be compelled to admit religious into
        their scholastic societies.

        THE enemies of religious, not content with trying to hinder them from
        producing fruit in the Church by teaching and expounding the Holy
        Scriptures, endeavour to do still further and greater harm, by
        preventing them from preaching and hearing confessions, in the hopes
        that thus they may be rendered unable either to encourage the faithful
        in virtue, or to eradicate vice. Those who act in this manner, clearly
        show themselves to be those persecutors of the Church, who, as St.
        Gregory says (20 <i>Moral</i>, on the words
        <i>Quasi caputio tunicae</i>), “make a special effort to hinder the word
        of preaching.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        These enemies of religion adduce several arguments in support of their
        persecution. First, they quote the words which occur
        <i>XVI, quaest. I</i>, “The office of a monk is one thing, that of a
        cleric is another. Clerics feed their sheep: I (being a monk) am fed.”
        Again in <i>VII, quaest. I, cap. Nequaquam</i>, the following words are
        found: “The duty of the monastic life is not to teach nor to preside nor
        to feed others with the word of God, but to be subject.” To preach is to
        feed with the Divine Word, as is seen in John xxi. 17. The Gloss on the
        words “feed my sheep,” says, that “to feed the sheep of Christ is to
        strengthen the faithful lest they fall away.” Hence monks, and religious
        who are counted as monks, cannot preach. This is more clearly laid down
        in <i>XVI, quaest. I, cap. adjicimus</i>, in which the following passage
        occurs: “We declare that, with the exception of the priests of the Lord,
        no one has license to preach, be he layman or monk, no matter how great
        a reputation for learning he may enjoy.” Again, in <i>cap. Juxta</i> we
        read as follows: “ We ordain that monks shall cease entirely from
        preaching to the people.” St. Bernard likewise says in his work on the
        Canticles: “Preaching does not beseem a monk; it is not expedient for a
        novice; it is not permitted to anyone who is not sent to preach.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, it is, argued that they who nourish the people with the word of
        God ought also to minister to their temporal necessities. For, as the
        Gloss says, “to feed the sheep of Christ, means to strengthen the
        faithful lest they fall away; and, if necessary, to provide for their
        temporal needs.” As religious are, by their profession of poverty,
        unable to supply the people with material necessities, they cannot feed
        them, by preaching the word of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The prophet Ezekiel asks: “Should not the flocks be fed by, the
        shepherds?” (xxxiv. 2). By “shepherds,” says the Gloss, are signified
        bishops, priests, and deacons, to, whom the flock is committed. Hence
        religious, being neither bishops, priests nor deacons, and having no
        charge of the flock, may not preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, we read, (Ron. x. 15), “How shall they preach, unless they be
        sent? “ But, our Lord has sent none but the twelve Apostles (Luke ix),
        and the seventy-two disciples (Luke x). The “twelve Apostles,” says the
        Gloss, represent bishops, and the “seventy-two disciples” the priests of
        the second rank, or parish priests. St. Paul likewise (1 Cor. xii.)
        speaks of it “helps,” meaning those who assist their superiors, as Titus
        helped St. Paul, or as archdeacons help bishops. Religious, therefore,
        being neither bishops, parish priests, nor archdeacons, have no right to
        preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We read in the <i>Decretals</i> (<i>dist. LXVIII</i>), “Chorepiscopi”
        are strictly forbidden both to this Holy See and to all bishoprics
        throughout the entire world. This institution is an abuse and
        corruption.” The reason of the prohibition is given in these words,
        “For, our Lord only, as we know, established two orders: the twelve
        Apostles, and the seventy-two disciples. Whence this order arose, we do
        not know, but, as there is no reason for its existence, it must be
        abolished.” Preaching religious (our adversaries add), being neither
        bishops (i.e. successors of the Apostles), nor parish priests
        (<i>i.e.</i>, successors to the seventy-two disciples), ought likewise
        to be suppressed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Dionysius (<i>VI Ecclesiast. hierarch.</i>), says that the monastic
        Order ought not to be in a position of superiority to others,” or,
        according to another version, “is not instituted for the purpose of
        guiding other men.” Now men are led to God by teaching and preaching.
        Hence neither monks, nor other religious, ought to preach, or to teach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The hierarchy of the Church is modelled on the celestial hierarchy,
        according to the words (Exod. xxv, 40), “Look, and make it according to
        the pattern that was shown you in the mount.” Now in Heaven angels of an
        inferior rank never exercise the functiona proper to those of a superior
        degree. Since then the monastic order is counted among the lesser orders
        of the Church, monks and other religious ought not to perform the office
        of preaching, which belongs to bishops and other prelates of a higher
        rank (Dionyslus, <i>VI Ecclesiast. hierarch.</i>).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, when a religious preaches, he does so either with power or
        without power. If he preaches without power, he is a false apostle. If
        he preaches with power, he has a right to demand the means of
        subsistence. Our Lord, when sending forth His Apostles to preach, told
        them to take nothing with them on the way save only a staff (Mark vi.).
        This staff signifies, (according to the Gloss), the power of accepting
        the necessities of life from those subject to them. Now it does not seem
        fitting that religious should demand the means of support. Therefore,
        they ought not to preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Bishops have more right to preach than have religious, who are, not
        entrusted with the cure of souls. But, a bishop cannot preach outside
        his diocese, unless he be requested to do so by other bishops or
        priests. For it is clearly laid down (<i>IX, quaest. III</i>), “Let no
        Primate or Metropolitan presume to judge the church or parish or anyone
        belonging to the parish of another diocese”; and the same rule is given
        in several other chapters. Therefore, religious, who have neither
        diocese nor parishes, may not preach, unless specially invited to do so.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A preacher ought not to build upon another man’s foundation, nor to
        glory in another man’s converts. He ought, rather, to imitate St. Paul
        who says (Rom. xv. 20), “1 have so preached this gospel, not where
        Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation.”
        And, again, the same Apostle says (2 Cor. x. 15), “Not glorying beyond
        measure in other men’s labours,” which words the Gloss explains as
        meaning “not glorying where another has laid the foundation of faith,
        which would be to glory beyond measure.” In the same chapter, St. Paul
        uses the expression, “not to glory in another man’s rule,” which the
        Gloss interprets as signifying not to glory in those who are under the
        government of another.” Therefore, those who have not the care of souls
        ought not to preach to such of the faithful as are entrusted to others.
        They ought, rather, to lay the foundation of the faith among
        unbelievers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The adversaries of religious, not content with these efforts to prevent
        them from preaching, endeavour likewise to prove that they have no right
        to hear confessions. In support of this opinion, they quote from
        <i>XVI, quaest. I, cap. Placuit</i>: “We positively and irrevocably
        decree that no monk shall administer penance to anyone.” And in another
        chapter we find the words: “ Let no monk presume to administer penance,
        to receive a child to baptism, to visit or anoint the sick, to bury the
        dead, or to meddle with any office of the kind.” Again (<i
          >Cap. Interdicimus</i
        >), the following words occur: “We forbid abbots and monks to impose
        public penance, or to visit or anoint the sick.” From all these passages
        it appears evident, that monks and religious, (who are included under
        the same laws), have no right to hear confessions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Further, in the book of Proverbs (xxvii. 23) the following exhortation
        is addressed to priests in charge of, churches: “Be diligent to know the
        countenance of your cattle.” The Gloss thus comments on these words:
        “The Pastor of a church is bidden to take diligent care of those
        committed to him. He must know their doings, and he must remember to
        correct the vices which he may observe among them.” But how is the
        pastor of a church to know the actions and failings of those under him,
        save by confession? Hence the faithful should not confess to any except
        to their own parish priest.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We further find that the following words were pronounced by Pope
        Innocent in a general council (<i>extra de paenitentiis et remissis</i
        >): “Every one of the faithful, of both sexes, shall, on reaching years
        of discretion, confess all his sins privately at least once a year to
        his own priest. He who is thus absolved of his sins, need not confess
        them again.” Hence it follows that if any, save a parish priest, had the
        right to hear confessions and to give absolution, the faithful would not
        be bound once in the year to make their confession to their own parish
        priest. Now as religious are not parish priests, and have not charge of
        the faithful, they ought not to hear confessions nor to absolve
        penitents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The faithful are likewise bound, according to the same decretal, to
        receive the sacraments from their own priests. None but those in due
        dispositions ought to receive the sacraments. As a priest can only by
        means of confession judge of the state of soul of him to whom he
        administers the sacraments, it follows that only parish priests can be
        empowered to hear confessions and to give absolution.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is necessary that the Church should avoid not only sin, but the risk
        of sin, “that I may cut off the occasion from them,” as St. Paul says (2
        Cor. xi. 12). Now if the faithful are at liberty to confess to others
        besides to their own priests, many may say that they have been to
        confession, and yet approach the sacraments without confession. The
        parish priest would be powerless to hinder this abuse. Therefore,
        Religious ought not to be allowed to hear confessions, as they are not
        parish priests.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The power to absolve sinners, belongs only to him, whose duty it is to
        correct them. Dionysius, in his epistle to Demophylus the monk,
        expressly says that correction is the office, not of monks, but of
        priests. Hence religious ought not to administer absolution to
        penitents. As religious have no defined province or diocese or parish,
        they may, if they be allowed to preach or hear confessions at all, do so
        anywhere. Their power therefore exceeds that of bishops, primates or
        patriarchs, who are not universal rulers. Even the Pope has forbidden
        himself to be called Bishop of the Universe. And in the
        <i>Decretals</i> <i>(dist. XCIX</i>) it is distinctly laid down that “no
        Patriarch shall ever make use of the name “Universal.” The same
        prohibition is repeated in the next chapter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Arguments are further brought forward to prove that religious cannot, by
        authority of bishops, preach or hear confessions. It is objected, that a
        man no longer possesses what he gives away; and, therefore, if bishops
        commit the charge of parishes to parish priests, the care of those
        parishes belongs no longer to the bishops themselves, but to the parish
        priests. Hence they cannot give to religious faculties to preach and
        hear confessions without the consent of the parish priests. Again, it is
        urged that, by laying on a priest the care of a parish, the bishop frees
        himself from its responsibility, which rests on the priest to whom the
        charge is committed: “Keep this man; if he slips away, your life shall
        be for his life” (1 Kings xx. 39). If a bishop were answerable for all
        the parishes in his diocese, his responsibility and burthen would be
        intolerable. The care of each parish belongs to the priest appointed to
        take charge of it; and the bishop should not interfere with it further.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is further maintained, that, as a bishop is subject to his
        archbishop, so are priests subject to their bishops. But archbishops
        cannot meddle with the subjects of a bishop, unless he be proved guilty
        of negligence. “Let archbishops do nothing in matters concerning the
        affairs of the bishops without taking counsel with them” (<i
          >IX, quaest. III</i
        >). On the same grounds, bishops must not meddle with the affairs of
        parish priests, without their consent; unless a priest be proved guilty
        of negligence or fault. Each parish priest is the bridegroom of the
        church entrusted to him. But, if other clergy, besides those
        commissioned by the bishops, exercise in parish churches the ministry of
        preaching or hearing confessions, the Church win have many bridegrooms.
        This state of affairs would clearly be opposed,to the decree (<i
          >VII quaest. I</i
        >), ordaining that “as it is unlawful for a wife to commit adultery, or
        to be judged or disposed of during the lifetime of her husband without
        his permission; so the spouse of a bishop (i.e., his church or parish)
        may not during his lifetime be, without his will and consent, judged or
        disposed of; neither is it lawful to exercise ministry in such a church
        or parish.” And this prohibition, as Gratian says, applies not only to
        bishops, but to all ministers of the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our opponents, also, endeavour to prove that religious are not, even by
        the permission of the Apostolic See, allowed to preach or hear
        confessions. For not even the authority of the Pope can establish any
        custom, or make any law opposed to the statutes of the Fathers. This is
        clearly expressed <i>XXV, quaest. I, cap. Contra statuta</i>: “If it be
        against the statutes of the early Fathers that any should preach or hear
        confessions, save only the priests of the Lord, permission so to do can
        be given to no one, even as a privilege granted by the Pope” (Cf also
        <i>XVI. quaest. I</i>). We also find in
        <i>XXV, quaest. I, cap. Sunt quidam</i>, the following words: “If, which
        God forbid, the Roman Pontiff should try to overthrow the teaching of
        the Apostles and Prophets, he would be convicted, not of giving an
        opinion, but of falling into error.” If then there be an Apostolic
        ordinance “not to glory in another man’s rule” (2 Cor. x.), the Pope,
        were he to confer the privilege just mentioned upon any man, would
        commit an error.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is a law that, when a sovereign grants permission to a man to erect a
        building in a public place, it is understood that he to whom this
        privilege is conceded may only use it in so far as it be not to the
        prejudice of anyone. (See
        <i>Ne quid in loco publico aedificare, lib. I. Si quis a principe</i>)
        And in <i>XXV, quaest. II. cap. de ecclesiasticis</i>, St. Gregory says:
        “As we defend our own property, so let each one of us be jealous for the
        rights of his own church. I will not, through partiality, concede to any
        man more than he deserves; nor shall any cunning cause me to refuse to
        anyone that which is his right.” But if a man preach or hear confessions
        in a church uninvited, he is doing an injustice to the parish priest.
        Hence no permission for the exercise of these functions ought to be
        granted, without the consent of the clergy of the parish.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, if a sovereign grants any individual freedom to make a will, he
        does not thereby give him permission to do more than to draw up an
        ordinary and legitimate will. It is not conceivable that a Roman
        governor, the protector of law, should desire by one word to prevent the
        observance of the statutes concerning wills which have been framed with
        such laborious care. (<i>De inoffic. testament. lib. Si quando</i>) In
        like manner, if the Pope should grant to any persons the privilege of
        preaching or hearing confessions, the permission ought to be understood
        in its usual sense, i.e., subject to the wishes of parish priests.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A monk receiving priestly Orders has not the faculties for performing
        the functions attached to the sacerdotal office (e.g. the administration
        of the Sacraments), unless he be canonically appointed to the care of a
        parish. We further find it laid down (<i
          >XVI, quaest. I, cap. Adjicimus Monachi autem</i
        >): “If the office of preaching be, by, a Papal privilege, committed to
        any man, he cannot exercise it when souls have not been entrusted to
        him.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Moreover, neither the Pope nor any other mortal man can overturn or
        alter the eccesiastical hierarchy which has been divinely instituted.
        For this power has been given to no one “unto destruction, but unto
        edification” (2 Cor. x). But, in the order of the Church, monks are
        among those who are to be made perfect (see
        <i>cap. VI. Ecclesiast. hierarch.</i>). Nothing, therefore, can so alter
        this order as to place monks among those whose office it is to make
        others perfect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Those who argue in this manner strive further to prove that religious
        have no right to seek permission from bishops or parish priests to
        preach or hear confessions. If they do so, they are actuated by an
        ambitious desire of usurping the ecclesiastical office. In
        <i>VIII, quaest. I, cap. Sciendum</i>, we meet with the following words:
        “When a command is laid upon a man to assume an exalted position, he who
        obeys the order loses the merit of obedience, if he ambitiously aspires
        to the post.” Now preaching and hearing confessions are duties of the
        ecclesiastical state and, therefore, confer dignity and power. Hence
        religious cannot, without notable ambition, ask for permission to preach
        and hear confessions. They can only do so when required. Here then is
        the source from which the error mentioned before has arisen. For as
        Boethius says, the road of faith runs between two heresies; just as
        virtue keeps on the centre line between vice. For virtue consists in
        preserving the due balance of things, and by doing too much or too
        little man falls from virtue. In the same way, he who holds either more
        or less than the truth, falls into error; but truth is the centre line
        of faith. Now it must be remembered that there have been certain
        heretics, and some now exist, who consider that the power of the
        ecclesiastical ministry depends upon sanctity of life, and that he who
        is not holy loses this power, and that this power is increased in
        proportion to a man’s holiness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This opinion does not concern our point; but let us, for the moment
        presume it to be erroneous. From this error has arisen the presumption
        of certain men, especially of monks, who, elated by their holiness,
        have, at their own pleasure, usurped the functions of
        ecclesiastics—preaching, and giving absolution, without any episcopal
        commission. We find their audacity rebuked (<i
          >XVI, quaest. I, Pervenit ad nos</i
        >), in the following terms: “We are astonished that in your parish,
        certain monks, and abbots, have, contrary to the decrees of the holy
        Fathers, arrogated to themselves the rights and functions of bishops.
        They administer penance and remission of sins, bring about
        reconciliations, and dispose of tithes and churches. They ought not to
        presume to act thus, without license from the bishop, or authority of
        the Apostolic See,” Now in their condemnation of the presumption of
        these monks, certain men have fallen into the error of rashly saying
        that religious are unfitted to perform the duties just enumerated, even
        though they be appointed thereto by the authority of the Bishop. This
        error is thus mentioned (<i>XVII, quaest. I</i>), “There are certain
        men, filled rather with bitter jealousy than with love of truth, who,
        without any grounds for their assertion, have the presumption to state
        that monks, who have died to the world in order to live to God, are
        unworthy of exercising the priestly office, and are incapable of
        administering penance, of teaching Christianity, or of giving
        absolution, in spite of the power divinely committed to them at their
        ordination. But this is a complete error.” Other men, again, are led by
        their audacity into another mistake. They assert that religious are not
        merely precluded, by their state of life, from exercising the sacerdotal
        functions, but that, bishops cannot, without the consent of the parish
        priests, grant them faculties for their performance. Nay, the Pope
        himself, they say, cannot qualify religious to act as priests. Thus,
        this error leads to the same result as that which we have previously
        mentioned. For while one error detracts from the ecclesiastical power,
        the other asserts that the power of the church depends upon sanctity of
        life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our next task will be to refute this error, and we shall proceed in the
        following order:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        First, we shall show that bishops and superior prelates can preach and
        absolve those who are under the care of priests, without needing the
        permission of those priests.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Secondly, we shall prove that they can empower others to act in like
        manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thirdly, we shall make clear that religious are, when commissioned by a
        bishop, capable of exercising these functions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Fourthly, we shall demonstrate that it is expedient for the welfare of
        souls that others, besides parish priests, should be allowed to preach,
        and hear confessions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Fifthly, it will be shown that a religious order may advantageously be
        founded for the purpose of preaching and hearing confessions, with
        license from the bishops.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Sixthly, we shall reply to the objections of our adversaries.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The fact that a bishop has, in any parish of his diocese, all the
        powers of a priest, is proved by these words from
        <i>X, quaest. I, cap. Sic quidam</i>: “All that has been established in
        the Church, by her ancient constitution, belongs to the office and power
        of a bishop.” Again, in the next chapter, the same is laid down. Now the
        temporal things of the Church exist for the sake of that which is
        spiritual. Hence with far greater reason, the spiritual concerns of
        parishes are committed to the bishops. Again, in the same question it is
        said that “every parish is to be administered under the care and
        supervision of the bishop, by the priest or the other clerics whom he
        shall appoint, in the fear of God.” In the following chapter, we
        likewise read that, “a church must be governed and conducted according
        to the judgment and power of the bishop, who is charged with the souls
        of his whole flock.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, a priest in charge of a parish can do nothing in it, without a
        general or particular permission from his bishop. Hence
        <i>XVI, quaest. I, cap. Cunctis fidelibus</i>, we find the following
        passage: “All priests, deacons, and other ecclesiastics must, above all
        things, bear in mind that they may do nothing without license from their
        respective bishop. Without this license, a priest cannot in his own
        parish say Mass, baptise, or perform any other office.” Hence a bishop
        has more power in each parish of his diocese than have the priests of
        those parishes. For they can do nothing without the Bishop’s leave.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The Gloss commenting on the words (1 Cor. i.), “in every place of theirs
        and ours,” says: “These words signify in every place originally
        committed to me,” and the Apostle was speaking of suffragan churches,
        <i>i.e.</i> churches subject to the Church of Corinth. If then bishops
        are the successors of the Apostles and retain their office, as appears
        from the commentary in the Gloss on Luke x., the chief power in a parish
        belongs rather to the bishop than to the parish priest. For the words,
        “in every place of theirs and ours,” cannot mean that the church was
        first entrusted to St. Paul, and then taken from him and given to
        another, else it would have ceased to be his.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Apollo was a priest, ministering to the Corinthians, as we know from the
        words (1 Cor. iii. 6), “Apollo watered,” i.e., “by baptism,” (Gloss).
        Nevertheless, St, Paul regulated the affairs of the Church of Corinth,
        as we learn from his own words, “The rest I will set in order, when I
        come” (2 Cor. ii. 34). And again, “For what I have pardoned, if I have
        pardoned anything, for your sake have I done it in the person of Christ”
        (2 Cor. ii. 10). And, again, he writes to the Corinthians (1 Cor. iv.
        21): “What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod? or in the spirit
        of meekness and charity?” Again, “according to the measure of the rule
        which God has measured to us, a measure to reach even to you” (2 Cor. x.
        18). In another chapter, he says “Therefore, I write these things being
        absent, that being present, I may not deal more severely according to
        the power which the Lord has given me” (2 Cor. xiii. 10). This “power,”
        as the Gloss says, was that of “binding and loosing.” Hence we clearly
        see that a bishop retains full jurisdiction over the people entrusted to
        priests.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, priests are said to be successors of the seventytwo disciples,
        and bishops successors of the twelve Apostles (cf. Gloss on Luke x). Now
        it would be absurd to maintain that the apostles had no power of binding
        or loosing and of performing other spiritual works without permission
        from the seventy-two disciples. This argument holds good in like manner,
        with regard to the relations between bishops and priests.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Dionysius, furthermore, says (<i>V Eccl. Hier.</i>) that “although the
        duty of the episcopate is to perfect others, that of the priesthood to
        enlighten them, and that of the diaconate to cleanse them, nevertheless,
        bishops are bound not only to perfect but likewise to enlighten and to
        purify their people. In like manner, it is the office of priests not
        only to enlighten, but likewise to purify their flocks.” He gives the
        following reason for his assertion: “Inferior powers cannot become
        capable of the higher works; and it would be unjust were they to aspire
        to such a dignity. But the more divine powers are able to perform
        inferior operations, as we see by the words of Maximus.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is plain then that if a priest can do the work of a deacon, a bishop
        can accomplish all and more than that is done by a priest. A priest can,
        without permission from his deacon, read the gospel in his church.
        Therefore a bishop can, without license from the parish priest, absolve
        and administer the other Sacraments in any parish church of his diocese.
        What a man does through the agency of another he can do himself; but
        when priests give absolution it is their bishop who is said to absolve
        by their instrumentality. Hence Dionysius (<i>VI, cap. Eccles. Hiear.</i
        >) writes: “He who, according to us, is the high priest does, by means
        of priests, his ministers, cleanse and illuminate us. It is he who is
        said to exercise these functions; because he entrusts others with the
        power of performing these sacred actions in his stead.” Hence a bishop
        may, in his own person, give absolution or preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, the inferior clergy owe obedience to their prelates, in all that
        regards their care of souls. Thus St. Paul says (Hebr. xiii. 17), “Obey
        your prelates and be subject to them. For they watch (<i>i.e.</i>, they
        are solicitous for you in preaching) as being to render an account of
        your souls.” A parishioner is more stringently bound to obey his bishop
        than his parish priest. For, as the Gloss says in the commentary on the
        words Rom. xiii., obedience must be paid rather to the higher than to
        the lower power; thus a proconsul must be obeyed rather than a governor,
        and an Emperor rather than a proconsul. For, obedience must be
        proportioned to rank. This maxim applies to spiritual far more strongly
        than to temporal affairs. Hence bishops, who are invested with power
        superior to that of parish priests, are at the same time more fully
        responsible for the people. The words of the book of Proverbs (xxvii.
        25): “Be diligent to know the countenance of your cattle,” refer to the
        care of souls, and are chiefly carried out by hearing confessions.
        Therefore, it beseems bishops, even more than parish priests, to hear
        the confessions of the faithful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As the seventy-two elders, of whom we read (Nun. vi.), were given to
        Moses as assistants; so priests are appointed as coadjutors to bishops,
        who could not bear their burdens unaided. Hence at the ordination of a
        priest, the bishop makes use of the following, and other similar words:
        “The weaker we are, the more do we stand in need of assistance.” But the
        fact that a bishop has a coadjutor does not deprive him of his own
        powers; for he still continues to “be their primary agent, and priests
        are his ministers. Hence bishops have as good, yes a better right, than
        priests to perform every sacerdotal office without the permission of any
        priest.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Further, bishops hold, in the Church, the place of our Lord Jesus
        Christ. Therefore Dionysius says (<i>V Eccles. Hier.</i>), “The
        Pontifical order is the first of divine ordinances, and supreme in the
        hierarchy of the Church. In it all degrees of the ecclesiastical
        hierarchy are consummated, and made perfect. As we behold the universal
        hierarchy summed up in Jesus, so each particular hierarchy attains its
        fulness in its own chief priest, <i>i,e.</i>, its bishop. St Peter (1
        Pet. ii. 25) says of Christ, “be converted to the pastor and bishop of
        your souls.” These words also apply, chiefly, to the Roman Pontiff,
        “before whom,” as St. Cyril remarks, “every head must, by divine right,
        bow, and whom all must obey, as they would obey our Lord Jesus Christ
        Himself.” St. Chrysostom says, commenting on the text of St. John, “Feed
        my lambs”: “These words are equivalent to saying, “Be, in my place, head
        and master of your brethren.” Hence it is absurd and almost blasphemous,
        to say that a bishop, who represents Christ, cannot exercise the power
        of the keys over any person in his diocese.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In order to give absolution, it is necessary to have the power of the
        keys, and jurisdiction, over every soul in a diocese. By this the matter
        is determined; and for the administration of penance as for the other
        Sacraments, all that is necessary is the power of Orders and the matter,
        together with the appointed form and due intention. Now a bishop being a
        priest has the keys. He has jurisdiction over every member of his
        diocese, otherwise he could not summon them to appear before him. Hence
        without the permission of any priest, he can give absolution to anyone
        in his diocese.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is argued that it is necessary for parish priests to hear
        confessions, because they have the duty of administering the Blessed
        Eucharist, which noone should receive who is in mortal sin. But,
        Confirmation and Holy Orders likewise require a state of grace ‘m, their
        recipients; and these Sacraments can be given by bishops only. Hence a
        bishop is entitled to hear the confession of every person in his
        diocese.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Further, no one can reserve to himself what is not within his own power.
        Now by a common usage, bishops reserve to themselves certain cases for
        absolution. But, in order to act thus, they must have power to absolve.
        Hence they must likewise have power to absolve in all other cases in
        which they desire to do so.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Dionysius remarks that, in our hierarchy the episcopal power is
        universal, the power of priests and other ministers particular (<i
          >I, V, Eccl. Hier.</i
        >). But, as we know by philosophy, universal power acts more
        efficaciously on that which is subject to a particular power than does
        that particular power itself. Hence a bishop exercises the power of the
        keys more efficaciously on those who are subject to priests, than do
        priests themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Further, it is plain that no man can give to another anything that he
        does not himself possess. It is the office of a bishop to give authority
        to priests. But, by imparting authority, a bishop does not deprive
        himself of it, for spiritual gifts are only bestowed by the action of
        the giver on the recipient. But as an agent does not, by acting, lose
        the power of acting, a bishop retains all that power which he gives to
        parish priests.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Our next task will be to prove that certain men can be commissioned
        by bishops to preach and hear confessions in the parishes entrusted to
        priests. For, as it is stated (<i
          >de officio judic. ordin. cap. Inter caetera</i
        >), “a bishop may, with expediency, choose out certain men fit for the
        holy office of preaching.” And again, “we enjoin that, both in
        cathedrals and in conventual churches, bishops should appoint certain
        coadjutors and fellow-workers, who shall assist, not only in the duty of
        preaching, but in that of hearing confessions, imposing penance, and
        other such offices as may pertain to the welfare of souls.” From these
        words, it is plain that the clerics of monastic churches, who are not
        parish priests, may, by the authority of the bishop, preach and hear
        confessions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, in <i>Extra de haereticis, cap. excommunicavimus, quia vero</i>,
        it is laid down that, “all such as have been forbidden to preach, or who
        have not received, publicly or privately, license to preach from the
        Apostolic See, or from the Catholic bishop of a place, and shall yet
        usurp the office of preaching, do so under pain of excommunication.”
        Hence we see that the Pope, or a bishop, can give to any priest
        authority to preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Further, it is certain that the Apostles, of whom bishops are the
        successors, ordained certain priests in cities and villages to dwell
        continually among their people. But they likewise sent forth others to
        preach and to perform other offices, for the good of souls. Thus St.
        Paul writes (1 Cor. iv. 17), “I have sent you Timothy, who is my dearest
        son and faithful in the Lord, who will put you in mind, of my ways in
        Christ Jesus.” Again (2 Cor. xii. 18), “I desired Titus, and I send with
        him a brother,” <i>i.e.</i> Barnabas or Luke. The Apostle also writes to
        Titus (i. 5), “For this cause I left you in Crete that you might correct
        what was wanting, and that you might appoint priests, as I appointed to
        you,” Hence other priests, besides those in charge of parishes, may
        preach and hear confessions, with license from a bishop.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The offices of preaching, and of hearing confessions pertain both to
        jurisdiction and to Orders. But offices pertaining to jurisdiction can
        only be exercised by those who have received Orders. Hence if a bishop
        without asking permission of the parish priest, can preach or hear
        confessions in any parish church within his diocese; another priest may,
        by the commission of the bishop, act in the same manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This proposition is likewise proved, by the fact that persons seeking
        admission into the Church, receive from the papal penitentiaries letters
        empowering them to make their confession to any priest whatsoever. And
        the papal legates and penitentiaries preach everywhere, and hear
        confessions without asking any permission from parish priests, but
        solely by the authority of the Pope. This proves that commission can be
        given to certain priests both for preaching end for hearing confessions,
        without any necessity for a further license from parish priests.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It now remains to be proved that religious are fit to perform the
        functions, of preaching and hearing confessions. For in
        <i>XVI, quaest. I, cap. Pervenit</i> it is stated that “without the
        license of their own bishop monks and abbots may not presume to
        administer penance.” Whence it follows that religious, when authorised
        by the Pope or by a bishop may lawfully hear confessions. Again, in the
        same chapter the following words occur: “ We, in our Apostolic
        discretion and tenderness, decree that it is lawful for monks who are
        priests and who represent the Apostles to preach, baptise, give
        communion, pray for sinners, impose penance, and absolve from sin.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the next chapter, <i>Sunt tamen nonnulli</i>, Pope Boniface speaks
        thus: “We believe that, by the operation of God, the office of binding
        and loosing may be worthily accomplished by monks in priestly Orders, if
        they have been deservedly exalted to this rank. We further ordain that
        for the future, those shall be reprimanded who contend that priests of
        the monastic profession are excluded from the exercise of the sacerdotal
        functions. For the higher a man’s rank the greater is his power.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, bishops are bound, as far as possible, to imitate the divine
        judgments. St. Paul says (1 Cor. ii, 1), “ Be imitators of me, as I also
        am of Christ.” But God has judged some monks worthy to preach without
        any human authorisation. This was the case with the monk Equitius, as
        St. Gregory relates (<i>Dialog.</i>) and also with St. Benedict. Hence
        bishops may rightly esteem certain religious to be fit to preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Further, everything that is lawful to secular priests is lawful likewise
        to religious, with the exception of any points forbidden by their rule.
        In <i>Arg. xvi, quaest. I Sunt tamen nonnulli</i>, it is laid down “that
        it is right for monks to absolve and to perform similar functions. St.
        Benedict, the gentle guide of monks, has not forbidden such offices to
        be undertaken by religious.” Secular priests, when authorised by a
        bishop, may preach and hear confessions. Hence as there is no rule
        forbidding monks to perform these duties, they may preach and hear
        confessions in like manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is a greater dignity for a man to preach by his own authority, than
        by the commission of another. Now religious are always liable to be
        raised to the episcopate, in which rank they have a right to preach and
        do other work expedient for the welfare of souls at their own
        discretion. Why then should they be deemed unfit to preach by the
        permission of a bishop? The fact that a man is in a state of perfection
        does not incapacitate him from preaching. On the contrary, preaching is
        a ministry peculiarly befitting the perfect state professed by
        religious. Hence the Gloss, commenting on the words of Esdras (1 Esdras
        4), “all the rest” etc., says: “All those who have been chosen and
        delivered from the powers of darkness belong to the liberty of the glory
        of the children of God; and they all rejoice at being declared to belong
        to the society of the holy city (<i>i.e.</i>, the Church); but it is the
        prerogative of the perfect alone to labour at building up the Church by
        preaching to others.” The fact that these words apply to the perfection
        of religious, is proved by the following words: The more earnestly
        preachers instruct their hearers to love heavenly things, the lea will
        they care about earthly goods. They will even abandon what they already
        possess, in the hope of obtaining an eternal heritage.” This
        interpretation further appears in the interlinear commentary, which
        says, “all the rest” <i>i.e.</i>, “the rich who cannot preach.” Hence
        religious are not less fit than others to preach, and, with the
        commission of a bishop, have aa much right to hear confessions and to
        preach as have parish priests.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On the words, “then we set forward from the river,” (1 Esdras viii. 31),
        the Gloss comments: “Let us likewise call to our assistance the
        religious army of brethren by whose help we may carry the souls of the
        faithful to the society of the elect, and to the fortress of a more
        perfect life, as we should carry holy vessels to the temple of the
        Lord.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The right of religious to preach and hear confessions is proved by the
        common custom of the Eastern Church, in which almost all the monks are
        confessors.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, a greater responsibility attaches to the office of legate, and to
        the work of confirming bishops, and setting them over churches, than to
        the office of preachers or confessors. But, as we know that the first
        and more onerous duties are entrusted to religious, there is no reason
        why they should not perform the less important ones.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, the work of hearing lawsuits has less connection with the
        religious life, than have the tasks of preaching or absolving. But, as
        religious are employed in the former office, they may, with far greater
        reason, be entrusted with the latter functions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It now remains for us to show that it is expedient for the salvation of
        souls that others, besides parish priests, should preach and hear
        confessions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our first proof is taken from the words of our Lord (Matt. ix. 37), “The
        harvest indeed is great”—or as the Gloss explains, “There is a vast
        multitude capable of receiving the word and of bearing fruit”—“ but the
        labourers are few,” i.e. (according to the Gloss), “the preachers who
        shall gather together the church of the elect.” “Pray, therefore, the
        Lord of the harvest, that He send labourers into his harvest.” These
        words show that it is salutary for the Church that the word of God
        should be announced to the faithful by many preachers, with an ever
        increasing number of believers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, it is written in the Book of Wisdom (vi, 26), “In a multitude of
        counsellors, there is wisdom.” These words are interpreted by the
        interlinear commentary to signify “A multitude of preachers brings
        health to the whole world.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Paul says (2 Tim. ii. 2), “The things which you heard of me by many
        witnesses, the same commend to faithful men,” i.e., “men of sound faith”
        (Gloss) “who shall be fit,” <i>ie.</i>, “fitted by their good life,
        their learning and eloquence” (Gloss), “to teach others.” In other
        words, “the office of preaching ought to be committed to those capable
        of fulfilling it” (Gloss).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, the Gloss has the following comment on the words of Esdras (1
        Esd. iii.), “all that were come from captivity to Jerusalem”: “Not only
        is it the duty of, bishops and priests to build up the house of God,
        whereby is signified His faithful people; but the people themselves, who
        are called out of captivity into Jerusalem, the vision of peace, ought
        likewise to require ministry of the Word from those who know how to
        preach.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Gregory (<i>XIX Moral.</i>) remarks on the passage in Job xxix.,
        “when I washed my feet with butter”: “What shall we bishops say, who
        care not to impart the Word entrusted to us, when we see this married
        man who does not suffer himself to be hindered from preaching, either by
        his worldly garb, or his pressing occupations?” By these words we see
        that others besides prelates and parish priests may rightfully exercise
        the office of preaching.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We learn the same lesson from many other passages of the Old Testament.
        David is praised for having extended the worship of God, and for having
        established twenty-four priests for the benefit of the people (1 Chron.
        xxiii and xxiv). The same thing is related of Hezechiah (2 Chron. xxx.
        6): “The posts went with letters, by commandment of the King and his
        princes, to all Israel and Judah, proclaiming, according to the King’s
        orders: ‘Children of Israel, turn again to the Lord God,’” etc.
        Assuerus, again, as we are told in the book of Esther (vii.), sent swift
        messages through the provinces to announce the deliverance of the people
        of God. With much greater reason then may others, besides parish
        priests, be commissioned to preach and to perform such like offices for
        the salvation of souls.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Gregory, in a homily (<i>V, Part I on Ezekiel</i>), says: “The
        pastors of souls and they who have undertaken the responsibility of
        feeding the flock of Christ ought very seldom, if ever, to change their
        dwelling. But those who, for love of God, take journeys for the sake of
        preaching may be compared to wheels of fire. For the zeal which devours
        them, and wherewith they inflame others, causes them to travel swiftly
        from place to place.” This is another proof that the office of preaching
        should be committed not only to parish priests, but to others who can,
        by travelling from one place to another, spread the knowledge of the
        truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, it behoves a preacher of the Word to be free from any other
        occupation; whereas parish priests are constantly engaged in good work
        and in ecclesiastical business. The Apostles said, “It is not fit that
        we should leave the word of God and serve tables.” (Acts vi. 2). On this
        account, it is right that those who are in charge of parishes should be
        assisted by others not thus occupied.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The necessity for priests devoted to the ministry of preaching is,
        furthermore, shown by the great ignorance prevailing in some places
        amongst many of the clergy, some of whom know not even how to speak in
        Latin. It is rare to find any who are conversant with the Scriptures.
        Yet a knowledge of the holy writings is essential to those who would
        preach the word of God. Hence if preaching be entrusted solely to parish
        priests, the faithful will be greatly the losers. The ignorance which
        prevails among the clergy is also most detrimental in the duty of
        hearing confissions. For, as St. Augustine says (<i>De Penitentia</i>),
        “If any man desires to confess his sins, let him seek out a priest who
        knows how to bind and to loose. For if he be negligent in the matter, he
        may be neglected by Him who incites him and moves him to seek for mercy;
        and so both may fall into the ditch which, in his folly, he strove not
        to avoid.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Additional priests, deputed to preach, and to act as confessors, are
        likewise called for, on account of the great multitude of souls often
        committed to the care of one pastor. For, were some parish priests to
        devote their whole lives to the task, they would scarcely be able to
        hear the confessions of all their flock. It happens likewise that some
        of the faithful, having no opportunity of confessing to any save to
        their parish priest, will abstain altogether from confession. For they
        are ashamed to acknowledge their sins to those whom they see every day.
        Sometimes, again, they fancy that the priest is unfriendly to them, and
        the like. Hence bishops act very judiciously in providing them with
        other confessors, and thus preserving them from despair,
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The foregoing reflections naturally lead us to consider the
        expediency of a religious order being instituted for the express purpose
        of assisting parish priests in preaching and hearing confessions.
        Episcopal permission would, of course, be needed to authorise the
        brethren of such an order to undertake their duties.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Every religious order is based on the model of the Apostolic life. We
        are told that the Apostles practised community of life: “all things were
        common to them “ (Acts iv). The Gloss says that “the word ‘common’ is,
        in Greek, rendered by <i>caena</i>, or common meal, whence come the
        words <i>cenobites</i>, <i>i.e.</i> dwellers in common, and
        <i>cenobia</i>, i.e. common dwelling places.” The Apostles practised
        this mode of life, in order that leaving all things, they might be at
        liberty to preach the Gospel throughout the world. For the same reason,
        they prescribed this common life to their successors. Hence a religious
        order is peculiarly well adapted to the office of preaching.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. James says, “Religion pure and undefiled before God and the Father
        is this, to visit the orphan and the widow in their tribulation.” The
        most necessary form of visiting those in affliction, is that which is
        practised by such as labour for the salvation of souls. A religious
        order may then with great advantage, be instituted with this object in
        view that its members may seek out such as are in trouble, and encourage
        them to have patience, and to hope in, the promises of Scripture.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the interlinear commentary we find, on the words, “It is not fit that
        we should leave the word of God and serve tables (Acts vi. 2), the
        following observation: “Food for the soul is better than banquets for
        the body.” Now certain orders have already been instituted for the
        purpose of assisting men in their corporeal needs; it is still more
        fitting that another order should be established, to minister to their
        spiritual wants.” St, Augustine says: “It is better to nourish the soul
        that will live for ever with the Lord, than the body which must decay in
        death. The health of the body depends upon the condition of the soul;
        but the soul’s health does not depend upon bodily constitution.”

        It is more seemly for a religious to fight with spiritual weapons, than
        with sword and shield. But there are already in existence several
        military orders. It is therefore expedient that an order should be
        founded for the purposes of spiritual warfare. The religious of such an
        order ought, principally to preach the gospel, according to the
        exhortation of St, Paul, “Labour like a good soldier of Christ” (2 Tim
        ii. 3), “by preaching the gospel against the enemies of the Faith,” as
        the Gloss explains.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is essential that they who labour for the salvation of souls should
        be remarkable both for learning, and for sanctity of life. It is not
        easy to find enough priests with such a reputation to take charge of all
        the parishes throughout the world: neither is it possible, among secular
        priests, to carry out the statute of the Council of Lateran, which
        enjoins that there should be teachers of theology in every metropolitan
        church. This desire of the Church is, however, through the mercy of God,
        being carried out through the instrumentality of religious. In the words
        of Isaiah (xi. 9), “The earth is filled with the knowledge of the Lord.”
        Thus, it is highly expedient that a religious order should be founded,
        in which the brethren are learned and addicted to study, and at the same
        time have leisure to help secular priests who are not so well adapted to
        teach theology.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The advantage of such orders is further proved by the beneficial results
        produced by their labours. For in many parts of the world, heresy has
        been destroyed; many infidels have been converted; careless Christians
        have been instructed in the law of God; and many have been brought to
        penance by the efforts of religious. Hence anyone who condemns such
        orders as useless is clearly sinning against the Holy Spirit, by envy of
        the grace whereby God co-operates in the labours of these men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, in <i>XXV. quaest. I</i>, we read the following words: “No one
        can, either safely or rightly, pass rash judgments either on the Divine
        constitutions or on the decrees of the Holy See.” Since, therefore,
        certain religious Orders, as is proved by their very name (for, as St.
        Augustine puts it in his book <i>The Christian Life</i>, “no one is
        called by a name without a cause”), have been established, by the
        Apostolic See for the purposes of which we have spoken, anyone who
        condemns them does, by so doing, himself incur condemnation.

        6. We must now proceed to our final task that of answering the
        objections of our opponents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Their first argument is that the duty of monks is, “not to feed a flock,
        but to be fed.” This saying is to be understood as meaning that monks
        have not, by right of their monastic profession, the office of
        instructing the faithful. It was directed against the mistaken notion
        that sanctity of life alone is sufficient qualification for the
        ecclesiastical state. But it is equally true that it is not the duty of
        a secular priest to feed a flock, unless he has the care of souls, or
        unless he bears a commission from those holding such a charge. Religious
        are as fitted as are the secular clergy for the office of preaching. The
        only difference between them is that religious require a double license,
        viz. the authorisation of a bishop, and permission from the superior of
        their order, without which they may not act. The second objection must
        be answered in exactly the same way. For the words, “Let none, save the
        priests of the Lord, dare to preach,” is true, if we understand them to
        mean that no one may preach without a commission to do so.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In like manner, the prohibition to monks to preach, which is quoted
        against us, is to be understood to mean that monks may not, merely
        because they are monks, arrogate to themselves the office of preaching.
        And, in the same way, when it is said that “it does not beseem a monk to
        preach,” the words mean that the monastic state does not, of itself,
        confer a right to preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        When it is objected that they who feed the people with the word of God,
        ought likewise to supply their material necessities, we reply that this
        is perfectly true in cases where such charity is possible. For, as St,
        John says (1 Jn. iii. 17), “He who has the substance of this world and
        sees his brother in need, and closes the bowels of his mercy against
        him, how does the charity of God abide in him?” But, almsgiving is not
        always the necessary accompaniment to preaching; otherwise the Apostles
        would not have preached, for they possessed nothing to give. “Silver and
        gold have I none” (Acts iii. 6). Nevertheless, religious, who themselves
        are poor, are able, at times, to provide for the wants of the poor out
        of the donations made to them by the wealthy. St. Paul tells us that
        when he was sent to preach to the Gentiles, he was careful to remember
        the poor (Gal. ii.). To the objection that pastors are bound to feed
        their flocks, we reply that they cannot feed them entirely by their own
        efforts; they must be assisted by others, to whom they entrust the task.
        For he, by whose authority a deed is accomplished, is held responsible
        for its performance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        When it is urged that none have a right to preach, save those who are
        sent, and that we only read of our Lord’s sending the twelve Apostles
        and the seventy-two disciples, our answer is that they who ore sent by
        God have power to send forth others. St. Paul sent Timothy to preach:
        “Therefore have I sent to you Timothy” (1 Cor. iv. 17). Thus likewise
        other men may be sent forth to preach at the bidding of bishops and
        priests. But all thus sent must be regarded as the emissaries of the
        Lord, because it is by His power that they receive their commission. And
        all who are thus authorised to preach must, although not archdeacons, be
        regarded as the coadjutors of the bishops, because they are rendering
        them important assistance, such indeed “as Titus gave to St, Paul, or as
        archdeacons afford to their bishops” (Gloss). Hence it by no means
        follows that none save archdeacons can assist bishops in their labours.
        For, when any priest bearing the commission of a bishop preaches or
        hears confessions, these functions are accounted as having been
        performed by the bishop himself. Although it may be true that only two
        orders were instituted by our Lord for the purpose of preaching; the
        Church, or the Pope to whom is confided all ecclesiastical power, could
        found a third order of preachers. For, as we are reminded by the Master
        of the Sentences, there were in the early Church two degrees only in
        Holy Orders: priests and deacons; but in course of time other grades
        were established.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our answer to the next objection which follows is that the decree to
        which it refers regards a certain order of men called
        <i>chorepiscopi</i>, who were ordained not in cities but in hamlets and
        villages, and who were invested with certain faculties not granted to
        ordinary priests, such, for instance, as that of conferring minor
        orders. For some time, these <i>chorepiscopi</i> were recognised in the
        Church as invested with ordinary powers, but they were finally
        suppressed, (as is related in the same distinction) on account of their
        usurpation of the episcopal functions. Thus the decree mentioned in this
        objection bears no reference to those religious, who, not having
        ordinary faculties, act as confessors by commission form a bishop. Such
        an order of religious does not exist in opposition to the number of
        orders established by our Lord, since, as it has been instituted by His
        authority, it is rightly regarded as having been ordained by Himself
        (see the words of Dionysius quoted above). The only conclusion
        concerning monks that can be drawn from his passage of Dionysius, is
        that monks have not, on account of their profession, the status of
        prelates, or of those whose duty it is to guide other to God. There is,
        however, no reason why a monk should not receive ordinary power or a
        commission to guide others, especially as the decree quoted merely sys
        that the monastic orders are not instituted in order to be in command of
        others or to guide. It does not say that the members of these orders
        cannot or ought not hold such a position. This is evident from the
        authority of Dionysius quoted above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The argument that the ecclesiastical hierarchy is a copy of the heavenly
        hierarchy is only partially true. In the heavenly, but not in the
        earthly hierarchy, there is a distinction of gratuitous gifts, according
        to the distinction of orders. Hence as the angelic nature is immutable,
        the angels of an inferior rank cannot be transferred to a superior
        grade, as is the case with mortals in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.
        Nevertheless, in the celestial hierarchy, angels of an inferior order
        can remain in their own rank, and yet can perform the functions
        pertaining to a higher grade. Thus Dionysius (<i
          >XIII, celest. hierarch.</i
        >) says, “The angel that cleansed Isaiah is called a <i>Seraph</i>,
        because he fulfilled the office of the Seraphim.” And St. Gregory, in
        his homily on the hundred sheep, says that “the spirits who are sent
        forth bear names denoting the order of their ministry.” Hence it is not
        unseemly, if in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, a man belonging to one of
        the inferior orders be commissioned to perform duties specially
        pertaining to a higher rank.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the objection that religious preach “either with power or without
        power,” we reply that they preach not with ordinary power, but by that
        conferred by special commission. It does not, therefore, follow that
        they have the right of demanding means of support; for this power has
        not been granted them. They could, however, exercise this power, were it
        conferred on them by those to whom it belongs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is untrue to say that if religious have faculties to preach, they
        possess powers superior to those of bishops or patriarchs. For bishops
        and patriarchs can, by their ordinary power, preach in any place, but
        religious, who have not the care of souls, can never preach by ordinary
        power. They can preach, not by ordinary power, but only by special
        commission; just as the bishop can exercise episcopal functions in a
        diocese belonging to another, with the permission of the bishop of the
        diocese in which he is staying.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is urged that no man ought to build on a foundation laid by another.
        This statement is untrue, and is against the teaching of St. Paul, who
        says (1 Cor. iii. 10), “As a wise architect I have laid the foundation,
        and another builds thereon.” This “building” is explained by the Gloss
        and by St. Ambrose to signify “preaching and teaching.” When the Apostle
        says: “I have so preached this Gospel, not where Christ was named, lest
        I should build upon another man’s foundation” (Rom. xv. 20), his word
        must be understood to signify, not that it would have been unlawful for
        St. Paul to have built upon another man’s foundation, but that he did
        not, at that moment, consider it expedient to do so. Hence the Gloss,
        commenting on these words, says: “lest I should build upon another man’s
        foundation, i.e., lest I should preach to those converted by other men.
        Not that St. Paul would not have so acted had such a course appeared to
        him desirable; but that he preferred to lay the foundations of the faith
        in some spot wherein it had not as yet been preached.” Were it unlawful
        to preach where another has already taught the Word of God, St. John the
        Evangelist would not have preached at Ephesus, in which city St. Paul
        had planted the Faith; nor would St. Paul have preached at Rome, where
        St. Peter had already been. But what will our opponents say if it should
        so happen that the religious whom they so bitterly denounce, be divided
        in such a manner that some go forth, to preach the Word to unbelievers,
        and, others remain among the faithful to assist the bishops? But this
        objection has really no connection with the point in question. For to
        build on another man’s foundation and to preach to another man’s
        converts are not the same thing. Otherwise, every priest when preaching
        in his own parish would be building on another man’s foundation, for his
        parishioners would, probably, be the converts of former priests of the
        parish.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The words of St. Paul, (2 Cor. x), “not glorying beyond measure in other
        men’s labour,” are, by those who are averse to the preaching of
        religious, interpreted to mean that to labour where another man has laid
        the foundations of the faith is to glory beyond measure. The Gloss does
        not explain these words as signifying that if St. Paul had laboured
        where another had already preached, he would have been glorying beyond
        measure. It understands the text to mean that, had St. Paul taken to
        himself the glory of having laid the foundations of the faith in such a
        place, he would have gloried beyond measure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The objection to the preaching of religious, founded on the words, “not
        to glory in another man’s rule,” is due to a misinterpretation of the
        commentary of the Gloss on this passage. The Gloss is quoted as saying,
        “not to glory in another man’s rule, i.e., in those who are under the
        government of another.” This is a mis-quotation. The passage of the
        Gloss referred to runs as follows: “Our rule, i.e., our ministry, which
        is imposed upon us by God, is to preach the Gospel freelyi not only in a
        few places, but in those (places) which are beyond your present
        dwelling. But we hope not to glory in another man’s rule; for those who
        are at a distance from you are not under any man’s, government.” If the
        passage in the Gloss really stood as it is represented by our
        adversaries, it would be difficult to understand, how one Apostle could
        preach in a province evangelised by another. St. Paul preached at Rome
        and at Antioch, which were subject to St. Peter; but he did not glory in
        those churches, as if they were committed to him; he, therefore, did not
        glory in another man’s rule. And, further, religious who are
        commissioned by bishops to preach, do so in no diocese save in that one
        for which they have faculties. Thus, they do not preach to another man’s
        flock. They are the coadjutors of the bishop, whose commission they
        hold.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is easy to answer the objections to the propriety of religious
        hearing confessions. The decree quoted as opposed to it only forbids
        religious to act as confessors on itheir own authority. It does not
        prohibit their doing so at the bidding of the Pope or of a bishop. This
        is clearly shown <i>XVI, quaest. I, Pervenit</i>. Neither are religious
        less fit than are secular priests for this duty (<i
          >XVI, quaest. I, Sunt tamen nonnulli</i
        >).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the next objection, viz. that parish priests, pastors of souls, ought
        to study the faces of flock, which they cannot do except by hearing
        confessions, we answer that confession is not the only means whereby we
        may know whether a man be good or bad. For, we can draw a conclusion
        from the judg ment passed upon him by his superior. Hence if a bishop
        absolves one of his flock, either by his own act, or through the agency
        of another commissioned. by him, his parish priest ought to be as
        satisfied that he knows such a man, as if he himself had been his
        confessor. He knows that his parishioner has been approved by the
        judgment of a superior, whom he himself has no right to criticise. And
        further, if according to the decretal he hear the confessions of his
        parishioners once a year, it gives him sufficient opportunity for
        knowing them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the objection that everyone is bound, once in the year to confess his
        sins to his own priest, we reply that the expression “his own priest”
        applies not only to the parish priest, but to the bishop of the diocese
        and to the Pope, who have, in a more extended sense than parish priests,
        the care of souls. The expression “his own priest” is used, not in
        contradistinction to the bishop, or Pope, who is the common priest, but
        in contradistinction to a stranger. Hence he who has made his confession
        to his bishop, or to a vicegerent appointed by him, has confessed to his
        own priest. And further, anyone who confesses once a year to his own
        parish priest, and makes himself intelligible to him, is not forbidden
        to make his confession at other times to any other priest who has
        faculty to give absolution.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The objection that, unless a priest hears a man’s confession, he cannot
        know whether he is in a fit state to receive the Blessed Eucharist, is
        based upon an error. For a priest can know the state of a communicant’s
        soul by the judgement of the superior who has given him absolution, and
        whom he ought to trust as he would trust himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The argument, that the permission to confess to a priest other than the
        parish priest, affords opportunity for concealment of sins, is
        fallacious. For, a priest ought to believe what a penitent says, whether
        it be for or against himself. Therefore, if the penitent says that he
        has made his confession, it ought to be taken for granted that he is
        speaking the truth. Even if the parish priest were to act as his
        confessor, he might be deceived; for the penitent might confess his more
        venial offences, and conceal his grievous sins. And it must likewise be
        remembered that, though the facility for confessing to different priests
        may be abused, it is nevertheless, as we have already shown, a safeguard
        against far greater evils.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The argument, that, a monk, having no power to correct others, cannot
        absolve them, is only true in a very limited sense. For, though monks
        have not this power in an ordinary way, they are able, by the commission
        of a bishop, both to correct and to absolve. The Demophilus to whom
        Dionysius wrote the words quoted was not a priest, nor even a deacon.
        This is clear from the Epistle quoted by our adversaries.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The same answer must be returned to the objection that, if religious can
        hear confessions anywhere, they can do so everywhere, and thus they
        become rulers of the Universal Church. Monks, on their own authority,
        can hear confessions nowhere. They can act as confessors only where they
        are commissioned to do so; and if the Head of the Church give them
        permission to hear confessions everywhere, they can do so everywhere.
        This, however, does not constitute them governors of the Church, since
        they absolve sinners, not by their own power, but by the authority
        delegated to them. The Pope is not styled universal Bishop, not because
        he does not possess complete and direct power over every diocese in the
        Church, but because he does not rule any particular diocese as its
        peculiar and special pastor. Were he to do so, the powers of the other
        bishops would lapse. This reason is given in the chapter quoted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The arguments brought as proofs that religious cannot, even with
        episcopal permission, preach or bear confessions, are easily answered.
        The proposition, that what a man gives away he does not still possess,
        does not hold good in things spiritual. These are communicated, not like
        physical things, by the transference of some dominion over them, but
        rather by an emanation of an effect from its cause. When one man
        communicates knowledge to another, he does not, on this account, deprive
        himself of this knowledge; for it remains in his power. In the same way,
        he that confers some power upon another, does not, by doing so, deprive
        himself of that power. A bishop does not, by conferring on a priest the
        power to consecrate the Body of the Lord, cease to be able himself to do
        so. St. Augustine, treating of the communication of spiritual things,
        says (<i>I De Doctrina Christiana</i>) “Everything that is not lessened
        by being imparted. is not, if it be possessed without being
        communicated, possessed as it ought to be possessed.” In like manner,
        when a bishop confers upon a priest the power of absolving, he does not
        himself lose that power, unless the power of a priest in his parish is
        considered similar to that of a soldier in his town. This idea is, of
        course, ridiculous; for priests are not masters, but servants. “Let a
        man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ,” St. Paul writes (1
        Cor. iv. 1). Our Lord, also, said to His Apostles, “The Kings of the
        Gentiles lord it, over them: but you not so: but 1e that is the greater
        among you, let him become as the least: and he who is the leader, as he
        who serves” Luke xxii, 25).

        The statement that a bishop, by committing the care of a parish to a
        priest, relieves himself of all responsibility connected with it, is
        untrue. For, a bishop is still answerable for the care of all the souls
        in his diocese (<i>Quaest. I, Cap. Quaecumque</i>). Hence St. Paul,
        after speaking of all his labours, concludes by saying, “Besides those
        things that are without: my daily instance, the care of all the churches
        “ (2 Cor. xi. 28). His burden, however, is rendered supportable to a
        bishop, because he has assistants of an inferior rank. But, even granted
        that a bishop, by committing a parish to a priest, relieves himself of
        its responsibility, it would not, on that account, follow that he would
        abrogate his power in that parish. For, the ministers of Christ are able
        to labour for the salvation of the faithful, not only by freeing
        themselves from responsibility, but likewise by increasing their own
        merit, and producing greater fruit among souls. Thus St. Paul undertook
        much work for the salvation of the elect, which he might, without any
        danger to his salvation, have omitted.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The argument that a priest is subject to a bishop, just as, a bishop is
        under an archbishop, is not quite correct. For an archbishop has not
        immediate jurisdiction over an episcopal diocese, except in matters
        specially referred to him. Thus an archbishop cannot summon before him,
        or excommunicate, one who is the subject of a bishop. A bishop, on the
        other hand, has immediate jurisdiction over his parochial clergy; he can
        cite any of them to appear before him; and he has power to excommunicate
        them. The reason of this distinction is that the power of a priest is
        imperfect compared to that of a bishop; priests are by divine right
        subject to bishops, as Dionysius proves. The subjection of a bishop to
        an archbishop depends only on an ecclesiastical ordinance and is limited
        by it. But a priest, being by divine right subject to a bishop, is
        subject to him in all things. The jurisdiction of a bishop over his
        priests resembles in kind that of the Sovereign Pontiff over all
        Christendom. For the Roman Church has not been given supremacy over
        other churches by the decrees of any synod, but by the words of our Lord
        and Saviour Himself (<i>In Drcretis, Distinct. XXI, Cap. Quamvis</i>).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the argument that parish priests are the bridegrooms of the churches
        committed to them, we answer that strictly speaking, the Spouse of the
        Church is Christ, of whom are spoken the words, “He who has the bride is
        the bridegroom” (John iii. 29). He, by His Church, begets children to
        bear His name. The other so-called spouses are in reality the servants
        of the Bridegroom, who co-operate with him exteriorly in this work of
        spiritual generation, but who do not beget spiritual children for
        themselves. Although they are but ministers, they are termed spouses,
        because they take the place of the true Spouse. Hence the Pope, who is
        the vicegerent of Christ throughout the entire Church, is called the
        spouse of the universal Church. In like manner a bishop is termed the
        spouse of his diocese, and a priest of his parish. But at the same time
        the Pope is the spouse of every diocese and the bishop is the spouse of
        all parishes within his see. But it does not follow from these words
        that there is in one church a plurality of spouses. For priests assist
        their bishop in his work, and bishops cooperate with the Pope; he
        finally is the direct minister to Christ. Thus, Christ, the Pope, the
        bishops, and the priests are but the one spouse of the Church. Hence the
        fact that the Pope or the bishop hear the confessions of the faithful of
        a parish, or commit this office to another, is not proof that one church
        possesses a plurality of spouses. True plurality would consist in the
        appointment of two ecclesiastics of the same rank to the same office.
        Hence were there two bishops in one diocese, or two parish priests in
        one parish, there would be the plurality forbidden by the canons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We must next answer the proposition that not even Papal permission can
        authorise religious to preach or to hear confessions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The first reason on which this assertion is grounded, that the authority
        of the Roman See cannot alter saything established by the statutes of
        the Fathers or institute anything contrary to these statutes. This is
        true with regard to those decrees which, in the judgment of the Saints,
        are of divine right, e.g., the articles of the faith formulated by
        Councils. But those matters which the Holy Fathers have declared to be
        of positive right are left to the judgment of the Pope to be altered or
        abolished by him, according to the requirements of the times. For, the
        holy Fathers assembled in councils cannot promulgate any decree save by
        the authorisation of the Sovereign Pontiff, without whose permission no
        council is allowed even to meet. Again, if the Pope sees fit to act
        otherwise than in the manner established by the holy Fathers, he does
        not act counter to their statutes. For, although, in such a case, the
        words of the statutes are not obeyed, the intention of those who have
        drawn up the statutes (to wit the welfare, of the Church) is fulfilled.
        For in matters which are of positive right, it may be impossible, at all
        times and under every circumstance, to adhere to the letter of a
        statute; although the intention with which it was framed is respected.
        One statute will necessarily be abrogated by a subsequent one. But the
        fact that certain religious, being neither bishops nor parish priests,
        exercise the functions of preaching, and hearing confessions, is not
        contrary to the statutes of the Holy Fathers, unless such religious act
        thus on their own initiative, unauthorised by the Pope or by a bishop.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In answer to the second objection, the Pope, as we have already shown,
        does not, by giving to religious the privilege of preaching or hearing
        confessions, act contrary to St. Paul’s admonition; for these religious
        do not preach to another man’s people. It is not true to say that the
        Pope cannot alter any Apostolic decree; for the penalties pronounced
        against bigamy and against fornication among the clergy, are, by
        authority of the Holy See, sometimes in abeyance. The power of the Pope
        is limited only in so far that he cannot alter the canonical scriptures
        of the Apostles and Prophets, which are fundamental to the faith of the
        Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the objection that the privileges granted by sovereigns are to be
        understood in the sense that they are only granted in so far as they be
        not prejudicial to any other, we reply that an injustice is done to
        another when something is withdrawn from him which has been established
        for his gratification or advantage. Hence Ezechiel says (xxxiv. 2), “Woe
        to the shepherds of Israel that feed themselves. Should not the flocks
        be fed by the shepherds?” But it is nowise prejudicial to a parish
        priest, if one of his parishioners be withdrawn from his authority. In
        the same manner an abbot may, by the Pope, be withdrawn from the
        authority of a bishop, and a bishop from that of an archbishop, without
        injustice to either. In fact, if such a course tend to the salvation of
        their parishioners, far from being prejudicial, it is most beneficial to
        all pastors who seek the things of Christ, and not such as are their
        own. St. Gregory commenting on the words in the eleventh chapter of the
        Book of Numbers (11:29), “Are you jealous for my sake?” says: “A
        spiritual pastor who seeks not his own honour, but the glory of his
        Creator, desires to be helped in his actions by all men.” A faithful
        preacher would wish that were it possible, the lips of all mankind
        should proclaim the truth which he alone is incompetent to utter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The argument that when a sovereign grants to a subject permission to
        make a will, it is with the understanding that such a will is only to be
        made in an ordinary and legal manner, holds good with regard to the
        Pope. When the sovereign Pontiff commissions anyone to preach and hear
        confessions, he only allows him to do so in a legitimate way; his
        preaching must be unto edification. But, if a man hold a commission from
        the Pope to preach, he need not, in order to preach lawfully, seek a
        license from any other superior. Such a course would stultify the
        authority of the Pope. A man who has obtained permission from his
        Sovereign to make a will, need not have another license from anyone
        else. All that is required of him is, to make his will in due form. A
        preacher licensed by the Pope requires no other authorisation. He need
        only observe the proper rules of preaching, such as that of using one
        style in addressing the poor, and another in speaking to the rich, and
        such other points as are mentioned by St. Gregory in <i>Pastorale</i>.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        When it is urged that a monk does not, at his ordination, receive power
        to exercise his priestly office unless he be placed in charge of souls,
        we reply, by reminding those who make this objection that the priesthood
        is instituted for two ends. Its first and principal end is the true
        consecration of the Body of Christ. Power to accomplish this end is
        conferred at ordination, unless there be some defect in the
        administration or in the recipient of this Sacrament. The second end for
        which the Priesthood is instituted is for the welfare of the mystical
        body of Christ, by the keys of the Church entrusted to the priest. Power
        to accomplish this end is not conferred at ordination, unless the priest
        ordained be placed in charge of souls or unless this power be given him
        by the authority of someone who has the care of souls. But the power of
        the priesthood is never given in vain; for every priest has power to
        fulfil the principal purpose of his ordination. But the power of
        preaching is bestowed for no end, save for that of preaching. Hence as a
        privilege conferred by a sovereign, cannot be useless to him on whom it
        is bestowed; so, when the Pope gives to any priest a commission to
        preach, he has power to execute such a commission. Nevertheless, the
        Pope, by so acting, does not give to a religious the office of
        preaching, but rather the power to exercise such an office. For
        religious do not, as we have said, make use of their own power in
        preaching; they use the power entrusted to them by another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The words quoted from <i>I, quaest. de Doctrina</i> were written by
        Dionysius of lay monks, <i>i.e.</i>, of monks who are neither bishops,
        priests nor deacons, But, even if they be applied to all religious, the
        Pope, by sending monks to preach, would not be disturbing the order of
        the ecclesiastical hierarchy. For, as we have said before, he who is of
        an inferior rank can exercise an office belonging to a higher grade,
        thus imitating the action of the celestial hierarchy. Furthermore, in
        the ecclesiastical hierarchy those of a lower order can be promoted to a
        higher rank. This cannot take place in the heavenly hierarchy. Hence
        Pope Innocent III, before a General council, sent some Cistercian monks
        to preach at Toulouse.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The last objection, brought against religious who preach, is that it is
        ambition on their part to seek permission to exercise this office. This
        is untrue, for a desire to preach inspired by charity is on the contrary
        praiseworthy. Isaiah (vi. 8) offered himself to the Lord, saying: “Lo:
        here I am: send me.” This function may likewise be meritoriously
        declined out of humility. Thus Jeremiah said (i. 6): “Ah, ah, ah, Lord
        God, I cannot speak, for I am a child.” This is evident from the Gloss
        of St. Gregory. The same view is found in
        <i>VIII, quaest. I, cap. In scripturis</i>. We must remember that
        ecclesiastical offices are accompanied both by dignity and by labour.
        Therefore, they may, on account of their dignity, be declined; and they
        may be desired, for the sake of the work. “ If a man desire the office
        of bishop, he desires a good thing,” says St. Paul (1 Tim. iii, 1). On
        these words St. Augustine says (<i>XIX De civitate Dei</i>), “The
        Apostle desired to explain what is meant by the episcopate and how far
        it may be desired, for the name implies labour not glory “ (cf.
        <i>VIII quaest. I, qui episcopatum</i>, also the Gloss on the same
        text). Hence if the labours of the episcopate be distinguished from its
        attendant dignity, it may laudably and without danger of ambition be
        desired. In like manner, a religious who seeks from a parish priest or a
        bishop permission to preach shows not that he is inspired by ambition,
        but that he is filled with the love of God and of his neighbour.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As no sufficient reasons can be found for excluding religious from
        apostolic labours, their enemies try to impede their work by
        representing that they are bound to labour with their hands; and that
        they are thus unable to prosecute the studies which would fit them for
        preaching or hearing confessions. The malice which inspires these
        efforts against the labours of religious is typified by the words of the
        enemies of Nehemiah, who said, “Come and let us make a league together”
        (2 Esdras vii.). The Gloss has the following commentary on this passage:
        “As the enemies of the holy City begged Nehemiah to come down to the
        plain, and there to form a league with them; so do heretics and bad
        Catholics desire to make friends with the faithful, not in order that
        they themselves may ascend to the heights of the Catholic faith and of
        good works, but in order to induce those that they know to be living
        virtuously to descend to sin and to false doctrine.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Those who desire to see religious obliged to labour with their hands
        adduce several arguments in support of their wishes. First they quote
        the words of St. Paul (1 Thes. iv. 11), “Work with your own hands, as we
        commanded you,” alleging that as religious are, above all men, bound to
        obeythe apostolic precepts, they ought to consider manual labour as a
        duty. And again we read (2 Thes. 10), “If any man will not work, neither
        shall he eat.” The Gloss contains the following commentary on this
        passage: “Some persons pretend that the Apostle, in thus speaking, was
        alluding not to physical labour, such as that of agriculture or
        handicraft, but to spiritual works.” It adds later on, “Thus they blind
        both themselves and others to the true meaning of this charitable
        admonition, and they not only refuse to obey it, but even to understand
        its meaning.” Again the Gloss continues, “St. Paul would have the
        faithful earn their living by bodily labour, although certain religious
        are specially set apart for the worship of God.” Hence according to this
        Apostolic precept, religious ought to work.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Paul again says (Ephes. iv. 28), “Let him labour, working with his
        hands what is good; that he may have something to give to him who
        suffers need.” “Not merely in order to gain a livelihood” (Gloss). Hence
        religious, having no other means of assisting the poor, ought to labour
        with their hands. Again, the Gloss, commenting on the words in St. Luke
        x, ii, “Sell what you possess,” observes: “Do not merely give food to
        the poor, but also sell your possessions, in order that despising all
        things for the love of Christ, you may work with your hands, either in
        order to live, or to have something to give in alms.” Therefore,
        religious who abandon all their own possessions should live and bestow
        charity by the work of their hands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Further, as Religious make profession of perfection, they are bound to
        imitate the Apostolic mode of life. Now we have several proofs that the
        Apostles worked with their hands. For instance, St. Paul writes (1 Cor.,
        iv. 12), “We labour, working with our own hands.” In the Acts of the
        Apostles (xx. 34), we read, “Such things as were needful for me, and for
        those who are with me, these hands have furnished.” In this they may be
        imitated by others. “Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nothing, but
        in labour and in toil we worked night and day, lest we should be
        chargeable to any of you” (2 Thes. iii. 8). Religious ought, therefore,
        imitate the example of the Apostles by manual labour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Religious likewise are more bound than are secular ecclesiastics, to the
        performance of lowly work. Yet, in the <i>Decretals</i> (<i
          >dist. XCIX</i
        >), we find these words: “Let a cleric, in so far as he can do so
        without injury to his office, maintain himself either by handicraft or
        by husbandry.” Again, “Let every cleric instructed in the words of God
        gain his livelihood by industry.” Further, “All ecclesiastics, whose
        health will permit it, must study and must acquire some handicraft.” How
        much more then are religious obliged to work!
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, in the Acts of the Apostles (xx. 34) we read: Such things as were
        needful for me, or for those who are with me, these hands have
        furnished.” Manual labour, therefore, is a mark distinguishing the
        bishops of the flock from wolves. Now if religious, by preaching,
        exercise an episcopal office, they are, certainly, bound to work with
        their hands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Jerome, writing to Rusticus, says: “It is the custom in the Egyptian
        monasteries, to receive no brother who will not work. This rule is made
        not so much for the sake of self-support as for spiritual advantage and
        to prevent the mind from being employed in dangerous thoughts.” For this
        same reason, manual labour is incumbent on religious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, religious ought to be always eager to make spiritual progress. As
        St. Paul expresses it, they ought to be “zealous for the better gifts”
        (1 Cor. xii. 31). Now St. Augustine, in his book,
        <i>De opere monachorum</i>, says that “religious who labour with their
        hands are preferable to those who do not work.” And, in the commentary
        on the words (Acts xx.): “It is more blessed to give than to receive,”
        the Gloss observes: “They receive the greatest glory who, having
        abandoned all that they possessed, labour in order to be able to supply
        the necessities of those in want.” Therefore, all religious ought to
        endeavour to work with their hands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Augustine, in the book already quoted, calls those monks who will
        not work, “contumacious.” He adds: “Who can bear to hear those who
        contumaciously resist the Apostolic precept not merely excused on
        account of infirmity, but praised for their holiness? “Contumacy is a
        mortal sin; else the Church would not visit it with excommunication.
        Hence no religious, can, without risk of sinning mortally, exempt
        himself from the duty of manual labour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Further, if religious be dispensed from work, the dispensation ought to
        be granted in order to give them opportunity for sacred psalmody, for
        prayer, for preaching, and for reading. But, it is not for these reasons
        that religious are exempted from labour. Therefore, they are bound to
        work. St. Augustine, in his book <i>De opere monachorum</i>, proves this
        obligation in the following words: “How do they employ themselves who
        will not labour with their hands? Gladly would I know what they do? They
        say that they devote themselves to psalmody, to prayer, to reading and
        to the Word of God.” The author then proceeds to examine each of these
        excuses. Speaking of prayer, he says: “One prayer from the lips of an
        obedient man will be heard more speedily than ten made by one that is
        scornful.” He, thus insinuates that he who will not work with his hands
        is proud and unworthy of being listened to by God. Next, speaking of
        those who say that instead of labouring they are singing sacred
        canticles, he says: “It is easy to chant and to work at the same time.”
        He then asks, “What is to prevent a servant of God, while employed in
        labour, from meditating on the law of the ‘Lord, and singing to the name
        of the Most High?” Thirdly, referring to reading, he says: “Do not they
        who say that they devote their time to reading find in the Scriptures
        the Apostolic precept to work? How great is their perversity! These men
        wish to read, but will not heed what is written. They desire to prolong
        the time for reading what is virtuous, but they will not accomplish the
        good works of which they read. Who does not know that he makes the most
        profit by his reading who is the swiftest to put it into practice?”
        Fourthly, the saint remarks about preaching: “Although one monk may have
        to preach, and therefore may not have time for work, all the brethren in
        the monastery cannot preach. If then they cannot all preach, why, on the
        pretext of preaching, should they all leave their work? But, even
        supposing that they can all preach, they ought to do so in turn, both in
        order that some may be left to do the necessary work, and because one
        speaker suffices to many listeners.”

        It is noticeable that on this point those who have once forsaken the
        beaten track of truth have, in their efforts to avoid one error, fallen
        into a contrary mistake. There was once among certain monks an erroneous
        idea that manual labour was detrimental to religious perfection, because
        it hindered religious from casting all their care upon God and thus from
        fulfilling our Lord’s behest: “Be not solicitous for your life, what you
        shall eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on” (Matt. vi. 25). But
        they who hold this opinion must, for the sake of consistency, deny that
        the Apostles laboured with their hands. They must interpret the words of
        St. Paul, “ if any man will not work, neither shall he eat,” as
        referring not to physical, but to spiritual labours. Otherwise the
        Apostolic precept would be opposed to the evangelical command. St.
        Augustine in his book <i>De opere monacorum</i>, which was written to
        confute this error (as he tells us in his book of <i>Retractations</i>),
        clearly proves that it is contraxy to the teaching of Holy Scripture. On
        the strength of this verdict, other captious men have diaseminated an
        error of a precisely contrary nature, teaching that religious are,
        unless engaged in manual labour, living in a state of damnation. The
        Gloss terms the upholders of this opinion friends and sup porters of
        Pharaoh, who said: “Why do you, Moses and Aaron, draw off the people
        from their works?” (Exod. v. 4). It makes the following commentary on
        the text: “If, today Moses and Aaron, by whom is signified the word of a
        prophet or a preacher, should stir up men’s hearts to leave the world
        and to renounce all that they possess in order to devote themselves to
        the service of God, and to the study of His law and word, the friends of
        Pharaoh would immediately exclaim: “See how men are led away, and youths
        persuaded to forsake work and military service and everything useful, in
        order to spend their time in idleness and folly. For what is their
        service to God? A pretext for idleness? Such were the words of Pharaoh,
        and thus do his friends still speak.”

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In order to defend the servants of God from persecution of this nature,
        we shall now prove that religious are not, except perhaps occasionally,
        bound to manual labour; moreover, those who do not work with their hands
        are in a state of salvation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the first place, the Gloss, commenting on the words: “Behold the
        birds of the air” (Matt. vi. 26), says: “The saints are deservedly
        compared to birds; for they seek Heaven, and they are so far removed
        from the world that they do no work on earth. They do not labour, but by
        contemplation dwell in Heaven. Of such may it truly be said: ‘Who are
        these that fly like clouds?’”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St, Gregory, in the second part of his second homily (<i>super Ezech.</i
        >), speaks thus: “He who leads a contemplative life, turns his whole
        mind to the love of God and of his neighbour. He ceases from external
        work, and is engrossed by a desire for his Creator, which leaves him
        capable of, no other activity. He forgets all other cares, and yearns
        only to behold God face to face.” Hence perfectly contemplative souls
        withdraw themselves from exterior occupations.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, the Gloss thus comments on the words (Luke x.): “Lord, have you
        no care that my sister has left me alone to serve?” “Such” (says the
        Gloss) “are the words of those who, understanding nothing of the nature
        of true contemplation, consider that charity to our neighbour is the
        only work pleasing to God.” Those who hold that religious are bound to
        labour with their hands, consider that this is an obligation imposed on
        them by brotherly love, in order that by their work they may have
        something to bestow in alms. They quote the words of St.Paul (Ephes.
        iv.28), “Let him labour with his hands that he may have something to
        give to him who suffers need.” They, therefore, who desire to see
        religious obliged to work, join in the murmur of Martha. But the Lord
        made excuse for the idleness of Mary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We can prove our point by the following example. St. Benedict, as we are
        told by St. Gregory (<i>II Dial.</i>), lived for three years in a cave,
        not working with his hands, and unknown to any save to the monk Romanus
        who brought him food. But who will dare to say that he was not in a
        state of salvation, when the Lord spoke of him to a certain priest,
        saying: “My servant in such a place is dying of hunger”? Both in the
        <i>Dialogue</i> and in the lives of the Fathers we find many other
        examples of saints who passed their lives without working with their
        hands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Manual labour is either a precept or a counsel. If it is a counsel, no
        one is bound to observe it, unless obliged thereto by vow. Hence manual
        labour is no duty for religious whose rule does not prescribe it, If, on
        the other hand, manual labour is a precept, it is incumbent alike on
        seculars and on religious, since both laymen and religious are equally
        bound to obey the Divine and Apostolic precepts. Hence if a layman,
        before his entrance into religion, was free to live in the world without
        work, he would, on becoming a religious, be equally exempt from the
        necessity of labour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        At the time at which St. Paul said: “If any man will not work, neither
        shall he eat,” religious were not distinguished from seculars; and the
        rule of labour was established for all Christians alike. All were
        equally called brethren, as we see from the words: “Withdraw yourselves
        from every brother walking disorderly” (2 Thes. iii. 10). Again: “if any
        brother has an unbelieving wife” etc. (1 Cor. vii. 12). On these words,
        the Gloss interprets the word “brother” to mean any one of the faithful.
        If then on account of the admonition of St. Paul, religious are bound to
        manual labour, the same duty is equally incumbent upon the laity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Augustine, in his book <i>De opere monachorum</i>, says: “Credit
        must be given to, and allowances made for, the delicate health of those
        who, in the world, were able to live without working; and who, on their
        conversion to God, have distributed all that they had to the poor. Men
        of this class are not generally equal to physical toil.” Hence we see
        that those who have lived in the world without labour are not bound,
        when they go into religion, to work with their hands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This point is further proved by another passage of the same book. In
        this, St. Augustine, speaking in praise of a certain wealthy man who had
        given all his goods to a monastery, says: “He has done well to set
        others an example by working with his own hands. For, had he been
        unwilling to labour, who would have dared to constrain him to do so?
        Neither is it of any consequence that he gave his possessions to a
        monastery instead of dividing them otherwise. For all Christians unite
        in one commonwealth.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        When a precept is only given under certain conditions or circumstances,
        it is only binding in the event of such conditions or circumstances
        arising to necessitate its observance. St. Paul gave the command to
        labour only in particular cases, as a safeguard against sin. When such
        sin can be otherwise avoided, manual labour is not a duty. The only
        three cases in which the Apostle enjoins it are: first in Ephes. iv. 28,
        “He who stole, let him now steal no more, but rather let him labour,
        working with his hands.” Here he proposes work as a remedy against
        theft, to such as preferred to steal rather than to earn their living.
        Secondly, he prescribes labour in 1 Thes. iv. 11, saying: Go, work with
        your own hands, as we commanded you, and conduct yourselves properly
        towards outsiders, and be dependent on nobody.” In this passage, labour
        is enjoined as a preventive against covetousness, which is theft by
        desire., Thirdly, St. Paul, in 2 Thess. iii. 11, again enjoins labour in
        these words: “For also, when we were with you, we declared to you that
        if any man will not work neither let him eat. For we have heard there
        are some among you who walk disorderly, not working at all, but
        curiously meddling,” “making a living by unjustifiable means” (Gloss).
        “Now we charge those who are such, and beseech them, by the Lord Jesus
        Christ that working with silence, they would eat their own bread.” In
        these verses, St. Paul enjoins labour on those, who, instead of working
        for a livelihood, procured it by illicit means. Hence we see that there
        is no duty of manual labour incumbent on either laymen or religious who
        can maintain themselves without either theft, covetousness or
        dishonesty. Neither does St. Augustine say that work is a precept to be
        obeyed by all. If we examine his words, we shall see that he only urges
        the fulfilment of the Apostolic precept. Hence religious are only bound
        to manual labour under certain circumstances.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Those who do not depend upon their work for subsistence are not obliged
        to labour. Otherwise, all rich men, both seculars and ecclesiastics, who
        live without working, would be in a state of damnation; which is, of
        course, an absurd hypothesis. Now there are some religious who have an
        assured livelihood, either from the alms of benefactors, or because the
        ministry of preaching is committed to them, and “the Lord has ordained
        that those who preach the Gospel shall live by the Gospel” (1 Cor. ix.
        14). The Gloss says that “God has made this provision for preachers, in
        order that they may be the more swift to proclaim His word.” Therefore,
        these words cannot be understood as referring only to prelates, for,
        though bishops have, in their own right, authority to preach, yet not
        only they, but all such as have a commission to preach, must be diligent
        in the exercise of this duty. Religious, as we have already proved, are
        included in this category. There are likewise certain religious who
        assist in the Divine Office in the Church. They have a right to live by
        this means; for St. Paul says that “they who serve the altar partake
        also with the altar” (1 Cor. ix. 13). St. Augustine says, in his book
        <i>De opere monachorum</i>: “If religious are evangelists, I grant that
        they have a right to live on the alms of the faithful. If they minister
        at the altar, they can claim the same right, for it is their due, and it
        is not an unjust demand.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The same remarks apply to those religious who devote themselves to the
        study of the Holy Scripture. St. Jerome writes, in his epistle to
        Vigilantius: “The custom prevailed in Judeea, and is still extant in our
        time, that those who possessed nothing on earth, whose only portion was
        the Lord, and who meditated day and night on His law, were maintained by
        the synagogues, and by the good offices of all mankind.” Hence we see
        that there is no obligation to labour incumbent on all religious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Spiritual profit is always to be preferred to temporal advantage. Now
        those who minister to the public welfare by the preservation of temporal
        peace are justly paid a stipend which enables them to live. St. Paul
        says (Rom. xiii. 6), “This is why you pay tribute. For they are the
        ministers of God, serving unto this purpose” (“by fighting for their
        country” says the Gloss). Hence they who minister to the spiritual
        necessities of the state, either by preaching or expounding the
        Scriptures or assisting in the public prayers of the Church, have a far
        better right to be supported by the contributions of the faithful. They
        are, therefore, not bound to manual labour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Augustine observes, again, in his book
        <i>De opere monachorum</i> that St. Paul worked with his hands in those
        places (of which one was Corinth) in which he was accustomed to preach
        to the Jews only on the Sabbath day. But when he was at Athens and
        preached daily, he lived not by his labour, but by the alms brought to
        him by the brethren from Macedonia. Hence we see that the function of
        preaching is not to be set aside for the sake of manual labour. Those
        men, therefore, who whether by commission from a superior or of their
        own right, are able to preach daily or otherwise to minister to souls,
        ought to abstain from manual work.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Further, works of mercy are preferable to physical labour. St. Paul
        says, (1 Tim. iv. 8), “ For bodily exercise is profitable to little; but
        godliness is profitable to all things.” But, even works of fraternal
        charity must give place to the exercise of preaching. “It is not fit
        that we should leave the word of God to serve at tables” (Acts vi. 2).
        “Leave the dead to bury their dead, but you go and preach the Kingdom of
        God” (Luke ix. 60). On this the Gloss observes: “The Lord teaches us to
        forego lesser advantages for the sake greater ones. It is more
        profitable to raise souls, by preacching, from the death of sin than to
        bury dead bodies in the earth.” Hence manual labour may lawfully be
        neglected for the sake of preaching.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is impossible, at the same time, both to gain a livelihood by work
        and to carry on a systematic study of Holy Scripture. St. Gregory,
        expounding Exod. xxv., “The bars shall be always in the rings,” says:
        “It is above all necessary that they who are destined for preaching
        should be unremitting in their studies, so that although they are not
        always preaching, they may always be prepared to preach.” Hence those
        whose duty it is to preach, whether by their own authority, as is the
        case with bishops, or by the commission of prelates, ought to set aside
        manual labour for the sake of study.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There are some words in the prologue of St. Jerome’s commentary on the
        book of Job, which show clearly that religious are justified in
        neglecting bodily labour for the sake of studying Holy Scripture: “Were
        I to spend my time in weaving baskets or plaiting palm branches in order
        to eat my bread in the sweat of my brow, no one would reproach me for my
        anxiety to supply my material wants. Now however that, in obedience to
        the admonition of Our Saviour, I labour for a meat that doth not perish,
        and strive to clear the sacred volume from the errors that have
        accumulated therein, I am reproached with having committed a double
        fault.” Later on he adds, “Therefore, my brethren, please accept these
        spiritual and durable gifts in lieu of fans, baskets and other little
        monastic presents.” Thus, we see that the monk St. Jerome was rebuked by
        envious tongues for preferring the study of Holy Scripture to manual
        labour. His example may profitably be followed by religious, in spite of
        the complaints uttered against them by their detractors.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St, Augustine further says in his book <i>De opere monachorum</i>: “They
        who have renounced all their possessions and distributed their fortune,
        whatever it may be, among the needy, and with pious humility desire, to
        be enrolled among the poor of Christ, can perform a work of mercy even
        greater than that of dividing their substance among those in want. For,
        if they are not hindered by ecclesiastical labours and have sufficient
        strength to work, by manual labour they will set a good example to the
        idle.” Hence we see that religious are dispensed from the duty of bodily
        toil, either by infirm health or by ecclesiastical business. Now of all
        clerical duties, preaching is the noblest and most useful. “Let the
        priests who rule well be esteemed worthy of double honour, especially
        those who labour in the word and doctrine” (1 Tim v. 11). Therefore,
        religious who are engaged in preaching ought not to be employed in
        bodily labour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It only, now, remains for us to answer the arguments brought forward in
        favour of the contrary opinion. The first argument brought against us is
        that manual labour is an Apostolic precept. To this objection we reply
        that it is a precept not of positive right, but of the natural law. This
        is clear from the words of St. Paul (2 Thes. iii. 6), “Withdraw
        yourselves from every brother living disorderly,” which the Gloss
        interprets to mean, “who lives not according to the law of nature.” The
        Apostle is speaking of such as will not work. Now the very constitution
        of our bodies teaches us that nature intends us to labour. We are not
        provided with raiment, as other animals are furnished with hides.
        Neither has nature given us weapons, like the horns which she has
        bestowed on cattle; nor the claws wherewith lions defend themselves. Nor
        is any food, save milk, supplied naturally to us, as Avicenna remarks.
        In lieu of the gifts bestowed upon other animals, man is endowed with
        reason, which teaches him to supply his needs, and with hands wherewith
        he can carry out the dictates of reason, as Aristotle says (<i
          >XIV De animal.</i
        >). As the precepts of the natural law regard all men without
        distinction, the law of manual labour does not apply more to religious
        than to others. Nevertheless, it is not true that all men ere bound to
        work with their hands. There are certain laws of nature which, in their
        observance, are of profit to none save to the one who obeys them. Such
        is the law obliging man to eat. These laws must be obeyed by every
        individual man. Other natural laws, e.g. that of reproduction, regard
        not only the man who obeys them, but are advantageous to the whole human
        race. It is not necessary that all these laws should be obeyed by every
        individual; for no single man is competent to perform all the activities
        which are needed for the continuation of the human race. One individual
        would not suffice for the different works of reproduction, of invention,
        of architecture, of agriculture, or for the other functions which must
        be exercised for the continuance of the human race. To supply the needs
        common to all mankind one individual must assist another, just as in the
        body one limb is subserved by another. It is in allusion to this mutual
        service which men are bound to render to each other that St. Paul says:
        “We are each members of one another” (Rom. ‘xii. 5). The differences
        existing among men, and enabling them to devote themselves to different
        occupations, are to be attributed primarily to Divine Providence, and
        secondarily to natural causes, whereby certain men are disposed to the
        performauce of certain functions in preference to others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence we see that no man is bound to any particuar work, unless
        necessity obliges him to it, and unless no one else will accomplish it
        for him. For example, if a man be constrained by necessity to dwell in a
        house which no one will build for him, he must build it for himself.
        With regard, therefore, to manual labour, I maintain that it is not
        incumbent upon anyone unless he be in want of something which must be
        produced by such labour, and which he cannot, without sin, procure from
        any other man. For we are said to be able to do anything when we can
        lawfully do it. This appears from the words of St. Paul (1 Cor. iv. 12).
        “We labour, working with our own hands,” “because “ (comments the Gloss)
        “no one will supply our necessities.” Hence the Apostle does not enjoin
        manual labour as a precept on any, save on those who choose to gain
        their living by sin, rather than by work. Nor can it be proved that
        anyone, be he layman or religious, is bound to manual labour, except to
        save himself from death by starvation, or to avoid a sinful mode of
        gaining a livelihood.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the second objection, which is based on the commentary of the Gloss
        on the words, “If any man will not work, neither let him eat,” we answer
        that this saying must be understood as referring to physical, as
        distinguished from spiritual work. It was directed against those who
        interpreted this passage as signifying spiritual labours only, and as
        forbidding the servants of God to work. The Gloss corrects this
        interpretation. St. Augustine likewise finds fault with it, in his book
        <i>De opere monachorum</i>. But even if the verse, “If anyone will not
        work neither let him eat” is understood as referring to manual labour,
        it does not prove that everyone who desires to eat, is bound to work
        with his hands. Were such a precept of labour universally imposed, it
        would contradict the words of St. Paul, “we worked day and night; not as
        if we had not power,” etc. As the Apostle had power to eat without
        working, the words: “If anyone will not work, neither let him eat”
        cannot be understood as implying an obligation to work imposed on all
        mankind. The class of men to whom St. Paul refers becomes quite evident
        from some other words of his in the same chapter (2 Thes. iii.): “For we
        have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly, not working at
        all, but curiously meddling” or, as the Gloss says, “providing
        themselves with the necessities of life by illicit means.” St. Paul
        continues, “Such people we instruct and urge to work with silence and
        eat their own bread.” For one accustomed to gain his living in an
        unlawful manner ought not to eat if he will not work. The words of the
        Gloss which follow: “that they may not be compelled by want to beg,”
        show that labour is not to be imposed upon the servants of God as a
        necessity, but that it is proposed to them as means of avoiding the evil
        of compulsory mendicancy. For, it is better for a man to work with his
        hands than to be reduced, against his will, to beggary. Nor does, it
        follow that they who profess poverty and who, out of humility, are
        content to beg, are bound to work with their hands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the third objection, we reply that the Apostle has given no absolute
        precept concerning manual work. He speaks of it as being preferable to
        theft: “He who stole, let him now steal no more, but rather let him
        labour with his hands,” etc. Hence as religious can live without
        stealing, there is no reason why they should be bound to work.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the fourth objection, our answer is that they who, in obedience to
        the counsel of our Lord, have sold all things, ought to follow Him.
        Therefore Peter said: “See, we have left all things and have followed
        You” etc. (Matt. xix. 27). Now men can follow Christ either by a life of
        contemplation or by one of action. They are equally His followers who
        leave all things in order to devote themselves to contemplation, or in
        order to give material alms, or to bestow spiritual assistance by
        preaching or teaching. The passage quoted from the Gloss, while it
        mentions one mode whereby the counsels of our Lord are observed, does
        not, thereby, intend to exclude the other way, else it would contradict
        the gospel. For Luke (ix. 59) tells us how our Lord said to a certain
        man, “Follow Me.” But he to whom He spoke, asked for time to bury his
        father. Christ answered him: “Let the dead bury their dead; but you go
        and preach the Kingdom of God.” Thus, it was our Lord’s will that some
        men, when they had left all things, should follow Him to proclaim the
        word of God. We can also say that this text, together with all that is
        contained about it in the Gloss, is a counsel. It is therefore binding
        only on such who are vowed to its observance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our answer to the fifth objection, is that the manual labour of the
        Apostles was sometimes a matter of necessity, and at other times a work
        of supererogation. When no one would supply the Apostles with food, they
        were obliged to work (cf. Gloss on 1 Cor. iv.). But we see in 1 Cor. ix.
        that at other times manual labour was for them a matter of
        supererogation. Now there are three reasons for which the Apostles chose
        to do work that was not a necessity. It was, first, in order to take
        from those false apostles, who preached only for the sake of temporal
        gain, the occasion of preaching: “But what I do that I will do that I
        may cut off the occasion from them,” etc. (2 Cor. xi. 12). Secondly, the
        Apostles, at times, resorted to manual labour, lest they to whom they
        preached should, in their avarice, find it a burden to provide for the
        material needs of those from whom they received spiritual benefits, and
        lest they should so fall away from the faith. “For what is there that
        you have had less than the other churches, but that I myself was not
        burdensome to you” (2 Cor. xii. 13). Thirdly, the Apostles laboured in
        order to set an example of industry. “We worked night and day, lest we
        should be chargeable to any of you” (2 Thes. iii. 8). But St. Paul did
        not work in cities, such as Athens, where he had facilities for
        preaching daily (see St. Augustine, <i>Do opere momachorum</i>). Hence
        it is not a matter of salvation for religious to imitate his manual
        labour, since all works of supererogation are not binding upon them. The
        other Apostles did not work with their hands except when they were
        obliged to do so in order to obtain food.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the sixth objection, we reply that the decree quoted by it refers
        only to those clerics who are not sufficiently endowed with
        ecclesiastical revenues, or assisted by the alms of the faithful, to be
        able to live without working.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We reply to the seventh objection that St. Paul gives to bishops the
        example of manual labour in those cases in which he himself had recourse
        to it, e.g., when such labour would not be an obstacle to the
        performance of their ecclesiastical duties, or when it would cause
        scandal to recent converts were they to be asked for material
        assistance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our answer to the eighth objection, is that manual labour, according to
        the authority of St. Jerome, is performed not only to earn a livelihood,
        but, likewise to repress dangerous thoughts arising from idleness and
        self-indulgence. But sloth and the desires of the flesh are overcome not
        only by bodily toil, but likewise by spiritual exercises. Hence St.
        Jerome writes: “Love the knowledge of the Scripture, and you will not
        love the vices of the flesh.” There is no precept enjoining manual
        labour, if idleness can be avoided by means of spiritual exercises, and
        if the body is subdued by means of other austerities such as watching,
        fasting and the like, among which penitential practices St. Paul
        mentions labour, saying “ in labours, in watching; in fasting” (2 Cor.
        vi.). The Gloss adds, “in manual labour,” the reason being, “because the
        Apostle worked with his hands.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We reply to the ninth objection that at times it is advisable to work
        with the hands, and at other times it is better not to work in this
        manner. When manual labour does not call a man away from some more
        useful occupation, it is very praiseworthy, as a means both of
        self-support, and of charity to those in need. It is especially to be
        counselled, in cases wherein those weak in faith or but recently
        converted would be scandalised if preachers, instead of earning their
        own livelihood, were to live on the alms of the faithful. It was on such
        occasions (as the Gloss remarks) that St. Paul had recourse to manual
        labour (1 Cor. ix.). When, however, such labour hinders a man from
        engaging in more useful occupation, it is better to set it aside. This
        lesson is given us by the commentary of the Gloss on the words, “Leave
        the dead to bury their dead” (Luke ix), and also by the example of St.
        Paul, who ceased to work when he had an opportunity of preaching. Manual
        labour is naturally a greater hindrance to modern preachers than to
        those of the Apostolic age. For the Apostles were taught by the
        immediate inspiration of the Holy Spirit, whereas in our time preachers
        must prepare themselves for their office by constant study, as is
        evidenced by St. Gregory in the words already given.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the tenth objection, we reply that the monks whom St, Augustine
        condemns as contumacious, belong to the class which, according to the
        Apostolic precept, is bound to work, and which St. Paul says is worthy
        of excommunication (2 Thes. iii.). Men of this description refuse to
        work, because they prefer to live in sloth, and to get their living by
        illicit means. That St. Augustine clearly refers to this class of
        person, appears in the words wherein he assigns a reason why those who
        leave an agricultural life in order to enter religion, ought to employ
        themselves in physical labour. He says that such men should work with
        their hands, because it is difficult to tell whether they become
        religious for the purpose of serving God, or in order to escape from a
        toilsome and penurious condition to a state, wherein they may be clothed
        and fed, living in idleness and honoured by those who, hitherto, have
        despised them and considered them nothing. Such men, evidently, belong
        to the class denounced by the Apostle as slothful, and urged by him to
        work in silence and eat their own bread.” St. Augustine accuses them of
        contumacy, chiefly because, perverting the words of St. Paul, they
        maintain that it is not lawful for the servants of God to work with
        their hands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our answer to the eleventh objection, is that by the spiritual works to
        which this objection refers, may be understood either the spiritual
        exercises that are for the common good, or such as are profitable to
        individuals. A man may either join in the prayers and psalmody of the
        Divine Office, and thus perform a work destined for the public
        edification of the Church, or he may, as do many laymen, occupy himself
        in private devotions. It is of the latter class that St. Augustine is
        speaking in the passage quoted in this objection. He is not alluding to
        those engaged in the public functions of the Church. This is clear from
        the words which follow. They can, he says, at the same time sing sacred
        canticles and work with their hands, after the example of craftsmen, who
        tell each other stories and listen with great attention, yet without
        ceasing to work. This conduct would not be permissible to such as are
        reciting the canonical hours. Again, reading may be, for some religious,
        a public duty, for they may have either to teach or to attend lectures
        in the schools as masters and scholars, either religious or secular. It
        may, on the other hand, be a private occupation, as is the study of the
        Scriptures prosecuted by monks in the cloister for their own
        consolation. St. Augustine recognises this distinction, and in the
        passage quoted as an objection, he speaks not of monks engaged in
        teaching or lecturing, but of such as “say that they devote their time
        to reading.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In like manner, preaching may be a public duty; and it is so, for such
        as are bound to proclaim the Word of God to the people. At other times,
        it is a private exercise; as is the case, when, in a community, one of
        the religious gives a spiritual exhortation, or when the Fathers of the
        Desert used to address words of edification to the brethren who came to
        visit them. It is clear that St. Augustine refers to this private mode
        of instruction. For he says: “Can all the religious of a monastery speak
        spiritual words to the brethren who come to them?” Hence it is plain
        that his words are to be applied not to preachers, but to such as speak
        unto edification. For, as the Gloss says (1 Cor. ii.), “Speaking is a
        private exercise, preaching a public function.” They therefore who are
        employed publicly in the various spiritual exercises which we have
        mentioned are justified in accepting the means of livelihood from the
        faithful to whom they minister. But those who devote themselves to such
        works for their private edification, to the neglect of manual labour, do
        certainly transgress against the Apostolic precept. They belong to the
        category of those whom St. Paul rebukes, and whom he bids to “work in
        silence,” and to “eat their own bread,” It is of such men that St.
        Augustine speaks. This is made clear by his words: “Why should we not
        devote a part of our time to the observance of the Apostolic precepts?”
        Again he says: “One prayer from the mouth of an obedient man will be
        heard more speedily than ten that proceed from scomful lips.” Once more,
        “How great is their perversity! They will not obey what they read.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        All these passages prove that St. Augustine denounces only those
        religious who apply themselves to spiritual exercises, in such a manner
        as to transgress the Apostolic precept. But those only, as we have
        before observed, can disobey this precept who are bound to fulfil it.
        They do not transgress it who neglect manual labour for the sake of
        public duties. Neither do they obey it who, instead of working with
        their hand, devote themselves to the exercise of contemplation. For (as
        has already been said), they are not impelled by sloth to escape from
        labour and to lead an idle life. They are, on the contrary, filled with
        such an abundance of divine love as to render them oblivious of every
        earthly care.”

        THE enemies of truth are not satisfied with the many false assertions
        which we have hitherto employed ourselves in disproving. They proceed
        still further. They, endeavour to overthrow the very basis of all
        religious life, namely, the practice of poverty established by our Lord.
        They affirm that it is unlawful for religious to abandon all their
        possessions, in order to enter a religious order, owning neither
        property nor income. The only reason, they say, which can justify such a
        step is the intention of doing manual work. They quote as an authority
        for this assertion the words of Prov. xxx. 8, “Give me neither beggary,
        nor riches; give me only the necessities of life; lest perhaps being
        filled, I should be tempted to deny; or, being compelled by poverty, I
        should steal, and forswear the name of God.” Those who leave all things,
        and enter a religious order which is destitute of all possessions
        abandon their means of subsistence and expose themselves to beggary.
        This is particularly the case with those who have not the intention of
        working with their hands. They, therefore, who act thus are liable to be
        tempted to steal and to abjure the name of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In Eccles. vii. 12 we read again, “Wisdom with riches is more
        profitable,” i,e., than wisdom alone. Hence it is reprehensible to
        choose wisdom without riches by abandoning the means of support, in
        order to gain wisdom. Again we are told that “through poverty many have
        sinned” (Sirach xxvii. 1). The Gloss interprets these words, as meaning
        poverty of heart and of work. Now if every occasion of sin is to be
        avoided, no man ought to reduce himself to poverty by parting with all
        his goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Paul gives to the Corinthians the following rule concerning
        almsgiving: “If eagerness is there, it is acceptable according to what a
        man has, not according to what he does no have. I do no mean that others
        should be eased, and you burdened” (2 Cor. viii. 12). The Gloss
        interprets this text to mean that a man must keep for himself the
        necessities of life, and that if he bring on himself poverty, he is
        giving beyond his means. Hence those who abandon all their possessions
        are giving alms inordinately, and in a manner contrary to the Apostolic
        rule.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The Gloss has the following comment on the words of St. Paul (1 Thess.
        v. 12), “We beseech you brethren to respect” etc.: “ Riches beget
        carelessness about salvation. Penury also causes men to forsake justice
        in their efforts to acquire wealth.” Now they who give up all that they
        possess in order to become religious reduce themselves to excessive
        poverty. Thus they lay themselves open to a temptation to depart from
        justice. Again on the words of the same Apostle, “but having food and
        wherewith to be covered” (1 Tim. vi. 8), the Gloss says: “Although we
        have brought nothing into the world, and shall take nothing out of it,
        temporal possessions are not to be entirely rejected.” Therefore, he who
        casts aside all material wealth in order to go into religion acts
        inordinately.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On the words of Jesus Christ,” he who has two coats, let him give to him
        that has none” (Luke iii, 11), the Gloss says: “We are commanded to
        divide two cloaks; for if one were divided it would clothe no one. Hence
        we see that charity must be proportioned to the capability of our human
        condition, and that no one should render himself entirely destitute, but
        that he should rather divide what he has with the poor.” Hence to give
        away everything in alms, and to keep nothing for ourselves, is
        unreasonable and inordinate conduct. It is, therefore, sinful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In Luke (xii. 29), we read, “Do not seek for what you shall eat.” The
        Gloss remarks: “Our Lord does not forbid us to reserve money for our own
        necessities; for He Himself had a purse. Unless such provision for
        ourselves were right, it would be forbidden, and Christ would have kept
        nothing for Himself.” Hence it must be virtuous and fitting to retain
        some portion of our property, instead of renouncing the whole.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is an act of prodigality to give away both what ought and what ought
        not to be given. He who gives away everything gives what ought not to be
        given, but ought to be retained. Thus he sins by prodigality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In his epistle to the Romans (xii. 1), St. Paul speaks of “your
        reasonable service.” The Gloss says that reasonable service consists “in
        the avoidance of extremes.” But, to give away everything is to give too
        much, and therefore it is to exceed the medium of liberality, which
        consists in “giving enough, and keeping enough.” Hence he who gives up
        everything to go into religion, does not offer a reasonable service to
        God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        God has given us this commandment (Exod. xx. 13), “You shall not kill,”
        <i>i.e.</i>, says the Gloss, “by depriving another of the means of life
        which you dost owe him.” Now as temporal possessions are “the means of
        life,” and as we “owe” the means of subsistence, in the first place, to
        ourselves, he who deprives himself of all material possessions sins
        against the commandment, “You shall not kill,” by depriving himself of
        the means of living.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It was better with those who were slain by the sword, than with those
        who died with hunger “ (Lam. iv. 9). Hence it is more iniquitous to
        expose ourselves to death by starvation than to destruction by violence.
        “It is not lawful for a man to act thus when he can, without sin, act
        otherwise,” says St. Augustine. Much less then is it, permitted to us to
        expose ourselves through starvation, by parting with all that we
        possess, and retaining nothing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, a man is more bound to preserve his own life, than to care for
        another. Now it would be sinful, to deprive another man of all means of
        subsistence, and thus to cause him to perish. “The bread of the needy is
        the life of the poor: he who defrauds them of it is a man of blood”
        (Eccles. xxxiv. 25). Therefore, he who gives away his all and retires
        into a religious order which has no common property sins by suicide.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The life of Christ is the example of perfection. But, we read that our
        Lord had a purse (John vii), and again that His disciples went into a
        city to buy bread (John iv.). Hence the entire renunciation of all
        property cannot be perfect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Further, the observances of the religious orders originated in the
        Apostolic mode of life. For, as St. Jerome says in his book
        <i>De illustribus viris</i>, all Christians of the primitive Church
        resembled the most perfect religious of our day. We are informed of the
        same fact by the book <i>In collationibus Patrum</i>, and also by the
        Gloss on the words (Acts iv.), “the multitude of those who believed.”
        But this same chapter of the Acts also states that in the Apostolic
        times the faithful had all things in common, and that there was no one
        needy among them. They, therefore, who relinquish their possessions and,
        having no common property, are bound to be destitute, lead not a
        religious, but a superstitious life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        When our Lord sent His disciples to preach, He gave them two commands.
        He told them, first, to take nothing with them on the way (Matt. x.,
        Mark vi., Luke ix.). Secondly, He told them not to go into the way of
        the Gentiles (Matt. x.). When the time of His Passion was at hand, He
        rescinded His first command, saying, “But now he who has a purse let him
        take it and also a bag” (Luke xxii. 36). He would seem likewise to have
        revoked His second command in the words, “Go therefore and teach all
        nations” (Matt. xxviii. 19), and “going into the whole world,” etc.
        (Mark xvi. 15). Since the second order has been rescinded, it need no
        longer be observed; but, on the contrary, the Gospel must be preached to
        the Gentiles. In the same way, the first of these two precepts is not
        now to be put in practice. Therefore, men need not entirely deprive
        themselves of the means of subsistence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In <i>XII quaest. I</i> we read: “It is right to possess the property
        belonging to the Church, and to despise our own possessions,” And again:
        “It is manifest that while, for the sake of perfection, men ought to
        renounce what belongs to them, they may, without any imperfection,
        possess the property of the Church, which belongs to all. Therefore, it
        stands to reason that if any man abandon his own possessions to go into
        religion, he ought to choose an order holding some common property.
        Again, in the same question, <i>cap. Videntes</i>, it is laid down that
        “the Sovereign Pontiffs have ordained that property should be conferred
        on the Church, in order that there should be no destitution among those
        leading a common life.” Hence those who despise common property and
        prefer to live in want, sin by acting counter to the ordinances of the
        Holy Fathers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The Gloss, on the words: “If you be the Son of God, cast yourself down”
        (Matt. iv.), has the following commentary: “No one ought to tempt God,
        when human reason teaches him how to act.” And again, “A man, when his
        human reason is at a loss, ought to, commend himself to God, not
        tempting Him, but devoutly confessing to Him.” Now he who has the means
        of procuring the necessaries of life, that is, food, and clothing, is
        taught by human reason how to act. If then he refuses to make use of
        these means, and yet expects his life to be preserved, he sins by
        tempting God as much as a man would sin who, seeing a bear approach him,
        should throw down his weapon of self-defence and yet expect God to save
        him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, we ought not to reject that which we daily pray for. Now each day
        we beg of God to supply our bodily wants, saying, “Give us this day our
        daily, bread.” Therefore, we ought not to expose ourselves to poverty by
        casting aside all our temporal possessions. We read in
        <i>Decr. de consecr., dist. I cap. Nemo</i> that “a church ought not to
        be built, before he who desires to build it, has provided a sum
        sufficient for the maintenance of the priest who is to take charge of
        such a church.” They, therefore, who possess no property live in
        opposition to the statutes of the Holy Fathers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The mode of religious life wherein common property is enjoyed is
        approved by the ancient Fathers, Sts. Augustine, Basil, Benedict, and
        many others. It appears rash, therefore, to introduce another form of
        religious life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the New Testament our Lord enjoins His followers to assist the poor
        in their necessities. But this precept cannot be carried out by those
        who have neither private, nor common property. Therefore, entire
        renunciation of all possessions is not praiseworthy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As things may at times be best understood by trarcing them to their
        source, we will now examine the origin of these propositions; and we
        will investigate the mode of their development. In the early days of
        Christianity there flourished at Rome a heretic, confuted in the
        writings of St. Jerome, whose name was Jovinian. He taught that all who
        preserved their baptismal innocence, would receive, in Heaven, an equal
        reward. He further taught that virgins, married persons and widows were,
        if baptised, all of equal merit in the sight of God, provided that there
        was no discrepancy between them with regard to their works. He said that
        as there is no difference between abstinence from food and eating with
        giving of thanks, so there is no inequality between virginity and
        marriage. By this teaching, he, of course, stultified both the counsel
        given by our Lord as to celibacy in His words, “Not all men take this
        word,” <i>i.e.</i>, remain, single, “but they to whom it is given”
        (Matt. xix. 2), and the advice of St. Paul on the same subject,
        “Concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give
        counsel” (1 Cor. vii. 25). The opinions of Jovinian have, St. Augustine
        tells us, been condemned as heretical.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The errors of Jovinian were, however, revived by Vigilantius, who
        impugned the faith, hated continence, and, in the midst of riotous
        feasting, declaimed against the fasting practised by holy men (see St.
        Jerome’s epistle <i>Contra Vigilantium</i>). But Vigilantius was not
        contented with imitating Jovinian in rejecting the counsel of virginity;
        he proceeded further to condemn the practice of poverty. St. Jerome,
        speaking of the errors of Vigilantius, says: “He maintains that it is
        better to distribute our goods among the poor by degrees than to sell
        them altogether and give away the price. Let him accept his answer not
        from me, but from God, who has said, “If you would be perfect, go, sell
        all that you have” etc. (Matt. xix.). The error of Vigilantius has been
        handed down by a succession of heretical teachers to our days. It is
        still perpetuated by the sect of the Cathari, and is expounded in a
        treatise written by a certain heresiarch of Lombardy named Desiderius,
        who, amongst other heretical propositions, condemns the conduct of those
        who sell all that they may live in poverty with Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        More recently, however, the old heresies concerning virginity and
        poverty have been revived by men who, while pretending to defend the
        truth, have gone from bad to worse, and who, not content with teaching,
        like Jovinian that a condition of wealth is as meritorious as voluntary
        poverty, or with preferring riches to poverty, as did Vigilantius, hold
        that poverty is to be absolutely condemned; and that it is not lawful
        for a man to leave all things for Christ, unless he enter an Order which
        possesses some common property, or can support itself by means of manual
        labour. They further assert that the poverty commended by the Scriptures
        is not that actual poverty whereby a man strips himself of all temporal
        possessions, but that habitual poverty which causes him to despise those
        earthly goods which he actually owns. We will now proceed to refute this
        mistaken opinion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (1st) We will prove that for evangelical perfection, not only habitual
        poverty is required, but, likewise that actual poverty which consists in
        the renunciation of material possessions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (2nd) We shall show that perfection is attained, even by those who own
        no common property.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (3rd) We shall make it evident that manual labour is not essential to
        perfection, even where men possess nothing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (4th) We shall refute the arguments whereby our adversaries seek to
        maintain their errors.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. In order to prove that evangelical poverty requires, not only
        habitual, but likewise actual poverty, we will remind our readers of the
        words: “If you would be perfect, go, sell all” etc. (Matt xix. 21). Now
        he who sells all that he has and distributes it to the poor practises
        not merely habitual, but likewise actual poverty. Hence actual poverty
        is needed for evangelical perfection. Again, evangelical perfection
        consists in the imitation of Christ, who was poor not only in desire,
        but in fact. The Gloss, on the words, “Go to the sea” (Matt. xvii.)
        says, “So great was the poverty of the Lord that he had not wherewith to
        pay the tribute money.” Again, on the words, “the foxes have holes” etc.
        (Luke ix.), the Gloss says: “our Lord meant to say that His poverty was
        so extreme that He had no shelter, and no roof to call His own.” We
        might adduce many other proofs that actual poverty pertains to
        evangelical perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The Apostles were mirrors of evangelical perfection. They practised
        actual poverty, renouncing all that they possessed. “Behold” (said St.
        Peter) “we have left all things” (Matt. xix. 27). Hence St. Jerome
        writes to Hebidia: “ Would you be perfect and attain to the highest
        dignity? Do as the Apostles did. Sell all that you have and give to the
        poor, and follow our Saviour. Alone, and stripped of all things, follow
        only the Cross in its bare poverty.” Hence actual poverty forms part of
        evangelical perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The Gloss on the words “How hard is for those who have riches” etc.
        (Mark x. 23), has the following comment: “It is one thing to have money,
        another to love it. Many possess it without loving it; many love it
        without possessing it.” Thus, while some men own wealth and love it;
        others congratulate themselves on neither owning nor loving it, for this
        is the safer course. Such men can say with the Apostle, “the world is
        crucified to me, and I to the world.” Hence it is evident that habitual
        poverty, in conjunction with actual poverty, is preferable to habitual
        poverty alone. This same remark may be made with reference to the words
        in Matt. xix. 23, “How hard it is for a rich man enter the Kingdom of
        Heaven.” The Gloss here observes, “It is safest neither to possess nor
        to love riches.” “Has not God chosen the poor in this world?” asks St.
        James (ii. 5). “Those who are poor, in temporal possessions” is the
        interpretation of these word given by the Gloss. Hence it is those who
        are actually poor who are chosen by God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The Gloss on the words, “every one of you who does not renounce
        everything that he possesses,” observes that “there is a difference
        between renouncing everything and leaving everything. All who make
        lawful use of their material possessions renounce them, in so far as
        their aspirations tend towards such things as are eternal. But those who
        leave all things act with greater perfection, for they set aside what is
        temporal in order to seek only what is eternal.” Hence abandonment of
        all things by actual poverty is a point of evangelical perfection;
        renunciation of all things by habitual poverty is necessary for
        salvation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Jerome, in his epistle against Vigilantius, says: “The Lord speaks
        to him who desires to be perfect and, with the Apostle, leaves father,
        ship and net. The one you praise is in the second or third rank; for he
        desires only to give the income of his possessions to the poor. We
        accept such a one, although we know that the first degree of virtue is
        preferable to the second or third degree.” From these words, it is plain
        that they who give all that they possess to the poor, are to be
        preferred before such as give alms only of their income.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Jerome, again, says, in his epistle to the Monk Rusticus: “If you
        have possessions, sell them and give to the poor. If you do not have
        them, you are free from a great burden. Therefore, being stripped of all
        things, you follow Christ in His poverty. This is a hard and painful
        undertaking; but it is rewarded with a glorious recompense.” For the
        sake of brevity, we omit many other passages from St. Jerome, all of
        whic must be understood as referring to actual poverty.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Augustine (Gennadius) likewise says in his book
        <i>De eccles. Dogmaibus</i>: “Though it be a good thing to distribute
        our riches by degrees among the poor, it is, a better to give all away
        at once with the intention of following our Lord, in order that free
        from anxiety, we may share His poverty.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Ambrose, in like manner, says in his book, <i>De Offic.</i>: “Riches
        will not give us the slightest assistance in attaining to a life of
        blessedness. This is clearly pointed out by our Lord’s words, “Blessed
        are you poor, for yours is the Kingdom of God.” And again, he says that
        “poverty, hunger, pain, and suchlike evils that are borne as evils, are
        not merely no obstacle to blessedness, but they are clearly pronounced
        to be aids towards attaining to it.” Now these words cannot be
        understood as referring to habitual poverty, whereby a man is merely
        detached from riches; for, riches have never been held by any to be
        obstacles to happiness. They must, therefore, be understood to refer to
        actual poverty, whereby all possessions are given up.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Gregory says (in the eighth homily of the second part on Ezech.), “
        When a man consecrates to God one thing, but not another, he offers a
        sacrifice. But, when he gives to God his whole life, with all that he
        has and all that he loves, he offers a holocaust, which is the most
        acceptable form of sacrifice.” Hence it is the most perfect work to
        abandon all that we have for the love of God. St. Gregory likewise says
        (<i>prolog. Moral.</i>), “While I was still constrained to serve the
        world in appearance, many temporal anxieties rose up around me and
        claimed all my attention. At length, escaping from them, I sought the
        gate of the monastery and, forsaking the things of this world, which I
        then regarded as vanities, I escaped from them, as a mariner from a
        shipwreck.” Hence we see that it is dangerous to possess material goods;
        for they occupy the mind to a perilous degree. It is better, therefore,
        to relinquish the possession of earthly things by actual poverty, that
        so, the mind may be freed from solicitude concerning them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Chrysostom asks in his book
        <i>Quod neno laeditur nisi a se ipso</i>, “What harm did material
        poverty do to the Apostles? Did they not live in hunger and thirst and
        nakedness? and were they not, on this account, more renowned and
        glorious? and did not their poverty increase their trust in God? “ Hence
        we see that actual poverty, which consists in privation of all things,
        forms part of Apostolical perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St, Bernard writes to the Archbishop of Sens: “Blessed is he who keeps
        for himself nothing of what he possesses. Blessed is he who has not a
        den like the wolves, nor a nest like the birds, nor a purse like Judas,
        nor a house, but who, like Mary, finds no room even in an inn, and thus
        imitates Him who had not whereon to lay His head.” Entire destitution of
        all earthly possessions, therefore, pertains to Christian perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In <i>I quaest. II. cap. Si quis</i>, we read: “He who strips himself of
        everything, or who, possessing nothing, desires nothing, is more perfect
        than he who out of his abundance gives something to the Church.” These
        words are another proof that actual poverty is a point of Christian
        perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        They who devote themselves to the contemplation of divine things ought
        to be more disengaged from temporal anxiety than they who apply
        themselves to the study of philosophy. But philosophers, in order to be
        able to give their whole attention to study, used to relinquish all
        their worldly possessions. St. Jerome says to the priest Paulinus (<i
          >de instil. monach.</i
        >), “Socrates, the Theban, a very wealthy man, when he went to study
        philosophy at Athens, cut away a large quantity of gold, judging that he
        could not, at the same time, possess both virtue and riches.” It is far
        more praiseworthy then to relinquish all worldly goods, for the sake of
        divine contemplation. The interlinear Gloss on the words, “ if you would
        be perfect,” etc. (Matt. xix) says: “Behold the life of contemplation
        taught by the Gospel.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A great reward is only given for great merit. Now a great reward, i.e.
        judicial power, is due to actual poverty. This appears from the words of
        our Lord (Matt. xix.), “You who have left all things” etc. The Gloss
        commenting on this text says, “They who have left all things and have
        followed the Lord shall be judges; but they who have lawfully retained
        and used their goods, shall be judged.” Therefore, the higher merit is
        due to actual poverty.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Paul (1 Cor. vii.), in counselling virginity, gives as the reason of
        his counsel that they may be without solicitude. The renunciation of
        riches frees a man from solicitude. For riches engender many anxieties
        in their possessors. Hence our Lord (Luke x.) speaks of them as “thorns”
        which, by their care, choke the Word of God in the hearts of the
        hearers. Therefore, even as virginity, so poverty belongs to evangelical
        perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. We shall prove, in conclusion that the perfection which consists in
        the entire sacrifice of private property does not necessitate the
        possession of common property.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The foundation of all perfection was laid by Christ and by the Apostles.
        We do not, however read that when they left all that they had, they
        possessed property in common. On the contrary, we are told that they had
        no house wherein to dwell. Hence common property is not an essential of
        perfect poverty.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Augustine tells us (<i>3 De doctrina Christ.</i>) that in the
        primitive church, the Jews who converted to Christianity, “being
        constantly in close contact with spiritual things, were so receptive of
        the influence of the Holy Spirit that they sold all that they had, and
        laid the price at the feet of the Apostles, to be distributed among the
        poor.” He further observes that “this fact is not narrated of any
        Gentile church; for they who had for gods idols made by hands were not
        so open to the Holy Spirit.” Hence we see that St. Augustine considers
        the perfection of the early Jewish church to have been superior to that
        of the Gentile churches. For, while the Gentile converts sold all that
        they had to give to the poor, the Jews sold their possessions so
        absolutely as to reserve to themselves no common property whatsoever.
        Hence poverty, without common property, is more perfect than that which
        retains property in common.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Jerome, writing to Hellodorus, on the death of Nepotiau, says in
        derision, “Men are richer as monks than they were as seculars. With the
        poverty of Christ, they possess wealth that they had not when they were
        subject to the devil; and the Church mourns over the riches of those,
        whom the world despised as beggars.” These words may often be verified
        in religious orders that maintain common property. They can never be
        true of such religious as possess nothing. Hence it is more meritorious
        for religious to have nothing than to possess property. St. Jerome,
        again, writes to Lucinus Beticus: “As long as we are engaged in things
        of the world, and our mind is occupied about our possessions and
        revenues, we cannot think freely of God.” Hence it is better for
        religious to be without property and revenues, than to possess them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Gregory (<i>3 Dialog.</i>) says, speaking of Isaac a servant of God,
        “When, as frequently happened, his disciples pressed him to accept for
        the use of the monastery the things that were offered to him, Isaac,
        vigilant in his care for poverty, was wont to make use of these strong
        words: ‘The monk who seeks possessions on earth, is no monk.’ For he
        feared to lose his poverty as a miser fears to be robbed of his gold.”
        This example proves that it is safest for religious not to possess
        common property.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The monks of Egypt, of whom we read in the lives of the Fathers, deemed
        those religious to be the most perfect, who lived in the desert,
        possessing nothing. Hence common property is not an essential of
        evangelical poverty.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Religious can be deprived of common property by tyrants. If then men are
        not to leave all that they possess unless they go into an Order holding
        property in common, tyrants would have it in their power to hinder the
        practice of evangelical poverty. This idea is, of course, an absurd one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The intention of our Lord in giving the counsel of poverty, was, to
        enable men to disengage their minds from anxiety about temporal things.
        Now common property cannot be possessed without much solicitude
        concerning its preservation and improvement. Hence those who possess no
        common property, practise the counsel of poverty in the most perfect
        manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. We shall finally show that actual poverty does not necessarily
        involve manual labour. St. Augustine says (in
        <i>De opere monachorum</i>): “They who in the world possessed the means
        of living without work and who, on their conversion to God, have parted
        with all that they had, should not be forced to labour with their hands.
        It is praiseworthy in them to embrace voluntary poverty for the love of
        Christ, even if they possess no common property.” In the primitive
        church of Jerusalem there were, as we know by the testimony of St.
        Augustine, many men of this description. Hence those who embrace
        voluntary poverty are not bound to manual labour, even though they
        possess no common property.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        No one is bound by precept to work with his hands, unless he can by no
        other lawful means procure a livelihood. Manual labour is not,
        therefore, a duty for those who possess nothing, unless they be obliged
        thereto by vow. Hence it is not true that they are bound absolutely to
        manual labour. They are only obliged to perform it, when it is their
        only means of subsistence; and, in such a case, everyone would be
        obliged to work with his hands, even if no vow imposed such labour on
        him as a duty.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The counsel of poverty was given by Oar Lord, in order to facilitate
        contemplation. This is pointed out by the Gloss on the words of Matt.
        xix., “If you would be perfect.” “Behold,” says the Gloss, “ the
        contemplative life ordained by the Gospel.” They, however, who are
        forced to gain their livelihood by the work of their hands, are greatly
        distracted from contemplation. If then those who, for the love of
        Christ, choose a life of poverty, be bound to manual labour, the very
        purpose for which the counsel of poverty was given will be frustrated.
        The counsel, therefore, will have been given to no purpose. This line of
        argument is, of course, absurd.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If they who leave all things for the love of Christ, be bound to have
        the intention of working with their hands, they must form this intention
        for one of the three following reasons. They must intend to perform
        manual labour either for its own sake or to provide means of
        subsistence, or in order to procure money which can be given in alms.
        Now it is absurd to say that the spiritual perfection of poverty can
        consist in manual labour undertaken for its own sake. For, were such the
        case the work of the body, would be preferred before the perfection of
        the soul. Again, it is not reasonable to say that a man ought to leave
        all things with the intention of going to earn his own living. For, if
        he had stayed in the world he could have lived by the possessions, which
        he has forsaken; and further the manual labour of the poor of Christ who
        devote themselves to prayer and other spiritual exercises barely
        suffices to maintain them. They must therefore, as St. Augustine says in
        his book <i>De opere monachorum</i>, be assisted by the faithful.
        Thirdly, it cannot be maintained that manual labour ought to be
        undertaken in order to procure means for almsgiving. For they who enter
        religion could have given much more abundantly to the poor of the goods
        which they possessed in the world. Thus, they would act unreasonably in
        leaving all things, in order to do manual work for the sake of giving
        alms. They, therefore, who, having left all things enter a religious
        order which has no common property are not, as we have already shown,
        bound to have the intention of performing manual labour.

        4. It only remains for us now to reply to the objections of our
        opponents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (1.) With regard to the text from the Book of Proverbs concerning
        “beggary and riches,” we answer that as there is no evil in riches
        themselves, but in the abuse of them, so beggary or poverty is not, in
        itself an evil. The only evil of poverty is its abuse, when there is
        impatience or reluctance in bearing the suffering resulting from it, or
        when there arises a covetous desire of the goods of others. “Those who
        would become rich fall into temptation and into the snare of the devil”
        (1 Tim. vi. 9). St. Chrysostom likewise says on St. Matthew, “Listen,
        you who are poor, and still more carefully you who desire to be rich. It
        is not a bad thing to be poor; the real evil is to be unwilling to be
        poor.” It is therefore evident that poverty which is a necessity is
        accompanied by certain dangers, from which voluntary poverty is free.
        For they who become poor by their own act do not desire to be rich.
        Hence the prayer of Solomon concerning beggary and riches refers to
        involuntary poverty. This is clear from the context, “being compelled by
        poverty,” etc. The Gloss likewise says on this text of Proverbs, “The
        man who walks with God, prays that he may not, either through abundance
        or scarcity of material goods, fall into forgetfulness of such as are
        eternal.” Hence we see that Solomon teaches us that it is not poverty or
        riches themselves which are to be avoided, but the misuse of either of
        these conditions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (2.) The words of Solomon, “ wisdom with riches is more profitable,”
        etc., must be explained according to the rule laid down by Aristotle (<i
          >I Ethic</i
        >), viz. that “the greatest good, such as happiness, joined to a lesser
        good, is preferable to that lesser good.” Hence wisdom, which is amongst
        the greatest goods, is preferable to riches, which are an inferior good.
        But, according to this rule, the greatest good joined to another very
        great good is of more worth than if it be joined to a lesser good, or if
        it be considered by itself. Hence wisdom joined to evangelical
        perfection, which consists in poverty, and is one of the greatest goods,
        is worth more than wisdom considered by itself, or joined to riches.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (3.) The words, “through poverty many have sinned refers to compulsory
        poverty, which is necessarily accompanied by a desire for riches. We see
        this by the context, “He who seeks to be rich, turns away his eye.” As
        the Gloss explains, “He turns away the eye of his soul from the fear of
        the Lord.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (4.) The passage of the Gloss, quoted as a fourth objection, is
        mutilated and misinterpreted. This becomes clear, if we subjoin its
        context, “He does not say that it is not better to give everything; but,
        out of consideration to those who are weak in virtue, he recommends them
        to give in such a manner that they shall not suffer want.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (5.) The warning that “poverty diminishes friendship,” is to be
        understood of involuntary poverty, which causes covetousness. This is
        plain by the words that follow, “while he seeks to be filled.” Satiety
        implies that superabundance, which they desire who are not satisfied
        with a little, nor are of the number of those of whom St. Paul says (1
        Tim. vi. 8), “having food and wherewithal to be covered, with these we
        are content.” He gives the following reason for this contentment with a
        little, “Those who will become rich, fall into temptation and the snare
        of the devil”; for the desire of great wealth often causes men to fall
        away from justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (6.) The words of the Gloss that “temporal possessions are not to be
        entirely rejected,” are to be interpreted to mean that we are to use our
        temporal means to procure food and clothing. This appears clearly from
        St. Paul’s words, “having food, and wherewith to be covered, with these
        we are content.” The Gloss does not mean that man can ignore all
        provision for temporal needs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (7.) To the seventh objection, we reply that some temporal things, such
        as food and clothing, are absolutely necessary for the support of life.
        If I have more of such things than I need, I ought to assist the
        destitute, but I ought not to deprive myself of necessary food or
        raiment. It is of such things as are acquired for our present needs that
        the Gloss speaks in the passage quoted in the seventh objection. But
        there are temporal things, such as money and property which, though not
        needed at present, may in the future be necessary to our support. There
        is no reason why perfect men should not distribute these things to the
        poor; for, before they are needed, God may supply the lack of them in
        some other way; and we are commanded in the Scriptures to trust that He
        will do so.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (8.) To the eighth objection, we reply that although it be not a matter
        of precept to reserve money for our necessities, it is nevertheless a
        matter of counsel. Our Lord carried a purse, not because He was unable
        otherwise to supply His needs, but for the sake of His weaker members,
        and in order that they might understand that it was lawful for them to
        do what they saw done by Christ. Hence the Gloss, on the words “ having
        the purse” (John xii), says: “He to whom the angels ministered, carried
        a purse out of condescension to our weakness and for the assistance of
        the poor.” Again, on the, verse in Psalm ciii., “bringing forth grass
        for cattle,” the Gloss says: “The Lord had a purse for the use of those
        who were with Him, and because in His own person He carried the
        infirmity of the weak, as when He said: ‘My soul is sorrowful’.” He was
        followed by pious women who ministered to Him of their substance. For He
        foresaw that in the future many of His followers would be weak and would
        seek material assistance. He did not fill his purse with His own
        property, but with alms given Him by devout and faithful men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (9.) Our answer to the ninth objection, is the rule laid down in
        <i>II Ethic</i>, viz. that “the medium in virtue does not signify the
        distance from extremes, but the due proportion of circumstances, ordered
        by well balanced reason.” Hence the medium of virtue does not consist in
        preserving the right balance between superfluity and scarcity in any
        circumstance considered in itself, but in a circumstance considered in
        comparison with other circumstances. Thus, the medium of virtue may vary
        according to the variability of circumstances. In sobriety, for
        instance, the circumstance <i>who</i> is varied according to the variety
        of the circumstance <i>what</i>. An amount of food which would be a
        moderate quantity for one person, would be too much for another, and too
        little for a third. Thus, again, some virtue, such as magnanimity,
        existing in its highest degree, may be moderate in proportion to some
        other circumstance. “The magnanimous man,” says Aristotle (<i
          >IV Ethic</i
        >), “confers the greatest dignity on himself.” He who exceeds the virtue
        of magnanimity by superfluity, does not thereby acquire greater dignity,
        but oversteps the limits of virtue; and those things which were
        moderation in him as a magnanimous man, are now superfluous. Hence we
        see that the medium of virtue is not destroyed because one circumstance
        is in its highest degree, so long as that circumstance be proportioned
        to other circumstances. Thus, in a case of liberality, if we consider
        the quantity to be given, and if we attend only to the circumstance that
        in certain cases it is superfluous to give everything, we shall find the
        vice of prodigality. On the other hand, with a certain change of
        circumstances, this prodigality will become perfect liberality. For
        instance, if a man gives all that he possesses to save his country from
        danger, he will be an example of perfect liberality. In the same way, he
        who gives away all that he has in order to fulfil the counsel of our
        Lord, acts not with prodigality, but with perfect virtue. If, however,
        such a man were to spend his all upon some unfitting object, or with
        some unseemly circumstances, he would be prodigal. We may say the same
        of virginity and of all other virtues wherein there appears to be excess
        when the common mean of virtue is overstepped. Hence we see that to give
        everything for the love of Christ means not to give both what ought and
        ought not to be given, but to give only that which ought to be given.
        For, although all things are not in every case to be given, yet all
        things are to be given up for Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (10.) Our reply to the tenth objection, is that grace is the perfection
        of nature. Therefore, it cannot be its destruction. There are certain
        things, such as food and sleep, which pertain immediately to the
        preservation of nature. In connection with these things, virtue does not
        exceed the limits of the preservation of nature. Hence if anyone deprive
        himself of that which nature demands for its support, it is a vicious
        and unreasonable act. It is such conduct that is rebuked, both by St,
        Paul, and by the Gloss. The Gloss says: “Let the service which you offer
        by the maceration of the flesh, be reasonable, i.e. tempered by
        discretion, and not excessive. Chastise your body with moderation, so
        that it be not destroyed.” But nature can be preserved without luxury.
        Hence if a man abstain from sensual pleasure, he is not performing a
        superfluous act, unless, by such abstention, he should fall into sin.
        For this reason, virginity is praiseworthy. Again, life can be preserved
        without material possessions, if we trust that Divine Providence will
        assist us in many ways. Hence a man does nothing superfluous, in giving
        up for Christ, all that he possesses, consequently, voluntary poverty,
        practised for the love of Christ, is no departure from the medium which
        ought to be observed in virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (11.) To the next objection, we reply that although he who leaves all
        things for the love of Christ, does, to a certain extent, deprive
        himself of the means of existence; yet, he can always count on the
        assistance of Divine Providence, which will never fail him; he can also
        reckon on the charity of the faithful. St. Augustine, in his book,
        <i>On Almsdeeds</i>, thus expresses himself on this subject: “Do you
        think that anything wil be lacking to a Christian, to a servant of God,
        to one devoted to good works, and to one precious in the sight of his
        Master? Shall he who feeds Christ not likewise be fed by Him? Shall
        earthly things be wanting to him, on whom divine and heavenly gifts are
        bestowed? Where do such unbelief and such impious and sacrilegious ideas
        spring from? How then can any be found in the house of God with so
        little confidence in Him? Does he who does not trust Christ absolutely
        deserve to be called a Christian? No, rather such a one should be named
        a Pharisee. For, as we read in the Gospel, the Pharisees, hearing our
        Lord teach the duty of giving alms and of making to ourselves friends of
        earthly goods, derided Him in their avarice. And even now we behold in
        the Church men who resemble the Pharisees, whose ears are closed and
        whose eyes are blinded, so that they can perceive no ray of the light of
        spiritual and salutary teaching. We have no reason then to wonder that
        such men hold the servants of God in contempt, when we know that the
        Lord Himself was despised.” These words point out, clearly that it is
        sacrilegious to say that they who abandon all things for the love of
        Christ, expose themselves to the risk of suicide.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (12.) Our answer to the twelfth objection, is that he who leaves all
        things for God does not incur any danger of dying of hunger. For Divine
        Providence will never abandon him: “I will not leave you, neither will I
        forsake you” (Hebr. xiii.). The Gloss thus comments on these words: “But
        in case any should say: ‘What are we to do if necessary help should fail
        us?’ the consoling words from the book of Joshua are added, ‘I will not
        fail you nor forsake you.’ A man who should die of hunger would
        certainly be forsaken; but, as this will never happen, let no one be
        covetous. For God speaks these words to every man that trusts in Him, as
        well as to Joshua.” He makes this promise to us on condition that we
        place our trust in Him. His words are not spoken to the avaricious nor
        to the covetous, but to “such as trust in God. It is not true to say
        that it is not lawful for a man to expose himself to danger; for a man
        may meritoriously expose himself to death for the name of Christ, even
        if it be possible for him to act otherwise. Thus, we read of many
        martyrs who, in the time of persecution, offered themselves to death by
        confessing their faith. If it were unlawful to expose oneself to peril,
        soldiers would not be justified in crossing the sea and incurring risks
        for the glory of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (13) To the thirteenth objection, we reply that a man is a master of his
        own, not of his neighbour’s property. He, therefore, injures another if
        he deprives him of what belong to him; but he does no injury to himself
        by sacrificing his own possessions. Hence Aristotle says (<i>V Ethic</i
        >) that “a man cannot, strictly speaking, commit an injustice against
        himself.” Furthermore, he who deprives his neighbour of what belongs to
        him, reduces him to involuntary poverty, which is dangerous. He who
        abandons his own possessions, accepts voluntary poverty which, if it is
        embraced for the love of God, is meritorious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (14.) Our answer to the next objection is that our Lord reserved a
        certain sum of money for necessary uses out of condescension to the
        weak; just as, out of condesconsion to human infirmity, he willed to eat
        and to drink wine with the Pharisees. It must not then be reputed as
        superstition in the holy fathers in the desert, if they refused to keep
        money for their own use, or if they chose to abstain from wine or from
        delicate fare. The money which our Lord reserved was not his own private
        property; it had been given to Him as alms. For, we are told (Luke viii)
        that “certain women... ministered to Him out of their resources.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (15.) To the fifteenth objection, we likewise reply that, although the
        Apostles reserved certain sums for themselves and to distribute among
        those holy men who had made themselves poor for Christ, that money was
        not their own, but was given them by the faithful in charity. When we
        are told that there was none needy among them, we are not to conclude
        that the Apostles and Christians of the early Church did not endure much
        poverty for the love of Christ. For, St. Paul says, (1 Cor. iv. 11),
        “Even to this hour we both hunger and thirst.” And again (2 Cor. vi. 4)
        “in much patience, in tribulations, in necessities” or, as the Gloss
        says, “want of food and clothing.” We must understand by these texts
        that the Apostles, in so far as they were able, supplied the poorer
        members of the community with such things as were needful to them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (16.) To the sixteenth objection we reply that the prohibition given by
        our Lord to His disciples, “not to go into the way of the Gentiles,” was
        absolutely rescinded by Him after the resurrection; because it then
        became necessary for the Jews to preach the word of God to the Gentiles
        (Acts xiii.). But Christ did not, at the last supper, absolutely revoke
        His precept to the disciples to take nothing with them on the way. He
        only gave them a different order, which was to be obeyed during the time
        of persecution, when they would not have been able to procure the
        necessities of life. Hence the Gloss says on the text of St. Luke, xxii.
        35), “When I sent you,” etc.: “The Apostles are not told to observe the
        same rule in time of persecution as in time of peace. For, when they
        were sent to preach, our Lord told them take nothing with them, for it
        was His will that those who preach the Gospel should live by the Gospel.
        But, when His death was imminent, and the hour drew near when both the
        pastors and the flock should be exposed to persecution, He instituted a
        rule befitting the circumstances; and so He permitted His disciples to
        carry with them the means of sustenance till such time as the fury of
        their persecutors should have abated, and a fitting season for preaching
        the Gospel should have arrived.” “Thus,” the Gloss continues, “does
        Christ teach us that under certain circumstances, we are justified in
        relaxing the rigour of our rule.” We may, for example, when preaching in
        a hostile country, carry with us larger supplies than we should have at
        home. But the heretics who make the objection which it is our duty to
        combat, do not accept the Gloss. We shall, therefore, show by the text
        of the Scriptures that when the faithful increased in number, the
        disciples of Christ did not carry with them the means of support We read
        (3 John i. 5), “Dearly beloved, it is a loyal thing you do when you
        render any service to the brethren, especially to strangers.” Again, “
        Because, for His name, they went out, taking nothing of the Gentiles, we
        therefore ought to receive such.” Now if the Apostles had carried
        supplies with them, it would not have been necessary for them to have
        been assisted by the faithful, even though the Gentiles had refused them
        any help. This is made still more clear by the words of the Gloss,
        “because for His name they went forth, forsaking their own possessions.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (17.) The seventeenth objection is answered by the fact that the Church
        supports many that are sick; and that she could not do so without the
        possession of some material wealth. Hence it is right for a man to give
        up his own property and to hold that of the Church; and he should act
        this way, on account of the poor. But, it does not follow that it is not
        expedient for perfect men, who have sacrificed all that belongs to them,
        to lead a religious life in an order which possesses no common property.
        Apostolic perfection is not wanting to those who have possessions in
        common; but it appears more manifestly in those who relinquish their
        private property and have no property in common.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (18.) We reply to the eighteenth objection that the decree quoted by it
        does not forbid the choice of a life of poverty for the love of Christ.
        It is simply a precept commanding bishops and all in possession of
        ecclesiastical property, which belongs to the poor, to provide for the
        poor, as far as they can, and to assist them in their needs. This will
        be easily perceived by anyone who studies the context of the chapter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (19.) Our answer to the nineteenth objection is that they who have
        relinquished all things for Christ, in the trust that He will provide
        for them, neither sin by presumption, nor do they tempt God. For, to
        have due confidence in God is not presumptuous nor is it tempting Him.
        Now the poor of Christ, especially the preachers of the truth, are bound
        to cherish this confidence in God. The Gloss says on the words in St.
        Luke (chap. x.), “Carry neither purse,” etc., “A preacher ought to have
        such trust in God that, even though he is not supplied with means to
        support him in this present life, he ought to be quite certain that
        necessary things will not be wanting to him, lest in his anxiety about
        temporal things, he fail to preach eternal truths.” Yes, unless he has
        this confidence in Providence, he is tempting God. On the words of 1
        Cor. x, “neither let us tempt Him,” the Gloss says, “Let us not ask:
        ‘can God prepare a table in the desert?’” But we must distinguish
        between the cases in which this implicit confidence does or does not
        tempt God. There are certain dangers from which a man cannot be rescued
        save by miracle; and if he exposes himself to such perils he is tempting
        God. A person would tempt God if, in hopes of Divine protection, he
        should fling himself from a wall, unless, indeed, he had been
        miraculously forewarned that it was the will of God to save him from
        death. Such foreknowledge was givem to St, Peter when, at the command of
        Jesus, he walked upon the sea; to Blessed Martin, when he said, “Under
        your protection, not of helmet nor of shield, but of the sign of the
        Cross, I shall safely make my way through the ranks of the enemy”; to
        St. John the Evangelist when he courageously swallowed the poisoned
        draught; to St. Agatha, who said, “Carnal medicine for the body I have
        never taken; but I possess the Lord Jesus Christ who, by His word alone,
        restores all things.” There are other cases wherein a remedy is
        attainable by inferior means; and a man does not tempt God if, under
        such circumstances, he trusts Him entirely. Thus a soldier does not
        tempt God by going to battle, although he is uncertain as to the issue
        of the fight. Neither does someone tempt God who renounces for His sake
        all that he possesses, trusting both in Divine Providence and in the
        charity of the faithful for the supply of his necessities. Rather, he
        resembles a man who, seeing a bear approach, resigns, for some
        reasonable motive, his weapon of self-defence to armed, men whose duty
        and desire it is to defend him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (20.) The answer to the twentieth objection, is that we are instructed
        to beg of God, to supply our temporal necessities, and that we ought not
        reject temporal assistance until we are provided with the food and
        clothing that we need.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (21.) The statute, quoted in the twenty-first objection, was drawn up in
        favour of the ministers of the Church. But, if any choose, as a work of
        supererogation, to serve the Church without stipend, they are so much
        the more praiseworthy in that they resemble St. Paul, who preached the
        Gospel without reward; he was a preacher ordained by God (1 Cor. ix.).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (22.) We reply to the twenty-second objection that although the holy
        Fathers have commended one course, they have not blamed the other.
        Therefore, it is not presumptuous, to follow this other course; else, it
        would not be lawful to introduce into the Church any new ordinance.
        Nevertheless, the mode of life of which we speak cannot be called new,
        as it was approved by many Saints, even in the primitive Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our answer to the twenty-third objection, is that it is a duty for rich
        men to assist the needy. For, as St, John says, (1 Jn. iii.), “He who
        has the substance of this world, and sees his brother in need, and shuts
        up his bowels from him: how does the charity of God abide in him?” But
        it is even more praiseworthy if a man, besides sacrificing all his
        possessions, consecrates himself to God. This is truly Apostolic
        perfection. For, as St., Jerome says; “To offer oneself to God is a
        truly Christian act and worthy of the Apostles, who, having renounced
        all they had, offered themselves to the Lord “ (<i>ad Lucinum Beticum</i
        >).

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        THE adversaries of Christian poverty strive to prevent its practice not
        only by raising objections against it, but by trying, indirectly, to
        abolish it entirely. They endeavour to deprive the poor of Christ of the
        means of subsistence, by teaching that it is not lawful for them to live
        on alms. They thus come under the category of those of whom the Preacher
        speaks, (Sirach xxxiv. 21), “The bread of the needy is the life of the
        poor; he who defrauds them of it is a man of blood.” They try to uphold
        their opinion by various arguments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. They quote the words of Deuteronomy (xvi. 19): “Do not show
        partiality or accept gifts [bribes]; for a gift blinds the eyes of the
        wise, and changes the words of the just.” Now alms are a species of
        gift; and as religious, above all other men, ought to have the eyes of
        the soul enlightened, they are not justified in living on alms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. “The borrower is servant to the one who lends” (Prov. xxii. 7). Much
        more then is he who accepts a gift the servant of him who gives it. Now
        it religious should be free from the bondage of the world, for they are
        called unto liberty of spirit. The Gloss, on the words (2 Thes. iii.),
        “That we might give ourselves a pattern for you,” observes: “Our
        religion calls men to freedom.” Therefore, religious ought not to live
        on alms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Religious make profession of a state of perfection. Now it is a more
        perfect thing to give than to receive alms. Hence in the Acts of the
        Apostles (xx. 35) it is said: “It is a more blessed thing to give than
        to receive.” Therefore, religious ought, rather, to work with their
        hands, so that they may be able to give to the needy, instead of
        receiving from others alms, upon which they are to live.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. St. Paul, writing to Timothy (1 Tim. v.), ordains that widows who
        have other means of subsistence, are not to live on the charity of the
        Church, lest they become a burden to her, and so make it difficult for
        her to support such as are widows indeed. Therefore, strong, able-bodied
        men ought to work for their living, and not to deprive the poor of the
        alms on which they depend for support. St. Jerome says (<i
          >I, q. II cap. Clericos</i
        >), “They who are able to live either on their patrimony or by means of
        their work, and yet accept alms, commit a sacrilege; and by their abuse
        of charity they eat and drink judgment to themselves.” Hence anyone who
        has other means of subsistence, and chooses to live on alms, must be
        reputed as guilty of sacrilege.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The Gloss commenting on the text of 2 Thes., “that we might give
        ourselves a pattern” etc., says: “ He who, in his indolence, constantly
        eats at the table of another must necessarily flatter his host.” Now
        they who live on charity often eat at the expense of their neighbour;
        they are, therefore, sure to become flatterers. It is sinful in them,
        therefore, to reduce themselves to a condition which obliges them to
        live on alms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The acceptance of gifts cannot be an act of any virtue save of
        liberality, which is the mean between giving and receiving. But a
        liberal man only accepts in order to give, as Aristotle says (<i
          >V. Ethic</i
        >). Hence they who spend their lives in accepting live in a
        reprehensible manner. St. Augustine in his book
        <i>De opere monachorum</i> thus rebukes certain monks who wished to live
        on alms, instead of by work: “These brethren, rashly, in my opinion,
        assume that they have the right to live by the Gospel, instead of by the
        labour of their hands.” Yet, those whom he thus reproaches, as we know
        by St. Augustine’s own testimony, had renounced all things for the love
        of Christ, and devoted themselves to spiritual exercises, such as
        prayer, psalmody, reading and the Word of God. Hence they who leave all
        things for Christ, even if they be entirely occupied in spiritual
        concerns, ought not to live on alms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. We are told in St. Mark’s Gospel that “He commanded them that they
        should take nothing for the way but a staff only” (vi. 8). The Gloss
        remarks, “by a staff is signified the power of accepting necessary
        things from inferiors. But none but prelates have inferiors.” Hence
        those religious who are not prelates have no right to accept alms from
        the faithful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Only those who labour have a right to the privileges of labour. Now
        the privilege granted by our Lord to those that preach the Gospel is
        that they shall live by the Gospel. This is confirmed by St. Paul (1
        Cor. ix. and 2 Tim. ii.), “The farmer who labours ought first to partake
        of the fruits.” Therefore, those that do not preach the Gospel ought not
        to live on the charity of the faithful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. St. Paul refused to accept alms from the Corinthians, in order to
        take away occasion from false prophets (2 Cor. ii.). But there are still
        certain men who shamefully choose to live on charity; therefore, if only
        to set them a better example, religious ought not to accept alms. Hence
        St. Augustine in <i>De operibus monachorum</i> says, “You have the same
        grounds as had the Apostles to remove the occasion from those who seek
        occasion.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. St. Paul refused to accept charity from the Gentiles, in order to
        avoid giving them any scandal. Hence the Gloss says, on the words in
        Luke viii., “And many other women ministered to them”: “It was in those
        days customary among the Jews, and was not esteemed any fault, for
        women, of their own resources, to supply teachers with food and
        clothing. But, as the Gentiles might have taken scandal at this custom,
        St. Paul notes that for this reason he had abstained from accepting alms
        from them (1 Cor. ix.).” But many seculars nowadays are scandalized at
        the sight of religious who wish to live without manual labour. On this
        account, it is the duty of religions to refrain from receiving charity.
        St. Augustine, in <i>De opere monachorum</i>, says: “In your meditation
        let your fire flame forth that you may pursue their evil works by your
        own good deeds; so that you may take from them the occasion of riotous
        merrymaking, wherein your reputation suffers and scandal is given to
        those weak in the faith. Have pity, therefore, and compassion on other
        men; and show them that you do not eat the bread of idleness, but that
        you seek the Kingdom of God by a narrow and toilsome road.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. If religious who are well and strong may lawfully live on alms
        without manual labour, other men are justified in doing the same. But,
        if everyone pursue the same course, the human race will come to an end;
        for no one will be found to prepare what is necessary for the support of
        life. Hence it can by no means be counted lawful for strong and healthy
        religious to live on alms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our adversaries, seek likewise to prove that although religious may live
        on the alms offered to them, they have no right to beg.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. We read in Deut. xv. 4, “There shall be no poor nor beggar among
        you.” Hence it is forbidden for anyone to beg, who can get his living by
        other means.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. In Psalm xxxvi. 25, it is written: “I have not seen the just
        forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread.” Therefore, beggars are not the
        seed of the just man, <i>i.e.</i>, of Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. A curse is not uttered in Holy Scripture against the just. But in
        Psalm cviii. 10 mendicity is accounted a curse: “Let his children be
        carried about vagabonds and beg.” Hence mendicity is not a state
        befitting perfect men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. St. Paul exhorts the Thessalonians (1 Thes. iv. 11), in the following
        terms: “Work with your own hands, at we commanded you:...walk honestly
        towards those who are without;...be dependent on nobody.” The Gloss
        adds: “Therefore should you work, and not live in idleness. This is
        honourable, and is as a light to unbelievers. You should not desire
        another man’s goods, you should neither ask for them, nor take them.”
        Hence it is plain that manual labour is preferable to begging.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. St. Augustine thus comments on the words: “if amy man will not work,”
        etc.: “The servants of God ought to do some work, whereby they may earn
        a livelihood; so that they may not be compelled by necessity to beg.”
        Thus, we see that they are bound to manual labour rather than to
        mendicancy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. St. Jerome writes to Nepotian: “Let us never ask, and but rarely
        accept when we are pressed to do so. For it is more blessed to give than
        to receive.” The servants of God ought then neither to beg for, nor to
        accept the necessities of life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The more severe the penalty inflicted, the more heinous, evidently,
        is the offence committed. This is laid down <i>XXIV. q, I</i>, “Let us
        not use unequal scales.” According to civil law, a sturdy beggar, if
        discovered, is sorely punished. For if he is of a servile condition, he
        is given over to be the slave of his accuser; if he is a freeman, he is
        condemned to be his perpetual servant (<i
          >De mendicant. valid., lib. unica</i
        >). Religious in robust health, therefore, sin by begging.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. St. Augustine, in <i>De opere monachorum</i>, speaks thus of
        mendicant religious: “Our crafty enemy sends out hypocrites who, in the
        monastic habit, roam from province to province. They bear no commission.
        They settle nowhere, and are never at rest. They beg for everything.
        They exact all things, either as the requirements of their lucrative
        poverty, or as the reward of their pretended sanctity.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. That which naturally causes shame in man, is intrinsically
        disgraceful. For, as St. John Damascene says, we only blush for what is
        shameful. Now men are instinctively ashamed of begging; and the nobler a
        mans’s nature, the more acutely he feels the disgrace of mendicancy.
        Thus St. Ambrose says (<i>lib. de offic.</i>) that shame at begging
        proves the nobility of a man. And Aristotle (<i>V Ethics</i>) says that
        a freeman is “not prone to beg.” Mendicity then is in itself
        disgraceful; and no one ought to resort to it who can live by any other
        means.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The Gloss, on the words: “God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Cor. ix.),
        runs as follows: “He who gives in order to rid himself of the
        importunity of a beggar rather than to relieve the need of a poor man
        loses the merit of his alms. But charity is often thus bestowed on
        beggars; for they weary men by their persistence.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our opponents likewise try to prove that even religious who preach ought
        not to beg nor to live on alms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. St. Paul says (1 Thess. ii.), “Neither have we used at any time the
        speech of flattery, as you know.” Now preachers who beg and live on alms
        are obliged to flatter those whose charity they receive. The Gloss on
        the words, “and leaving them, he went out” (Matt. xxi) says: “For as He
        was poor and flattered none, He received hospitality from no one in the
        city, save from Lazarus.” And yet, for this very cause, the preaching of
        our Lord was all the more powerful. For, as Luke tells us (xxi. 38),
        “the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear
        him.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Again, St. Paul says (1 Cor. iv. 11), “Even to this hour we both
        hunger and thirst and are naked.” On these words the Gloss makes the
        following comment: “Those who preach, the truth with sincerity and
        without flattery, and who reprove the vices of mankind are not
        favourably heard.” Therefore, preachers ought not to ask for alms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. St, Paul says: (1 Thess. ii. 5), “Neither have we taken an occasion
        of covetousness. God knows.” Gloss observes hereon, “The Apostle does
        not say: ‘I have not been covetous,’ but ‘I have neither said nor done
        anything that can be an occasion of covetousness.’” Preachers ought to
        be able to speak in like manner. Those, however, who beg become, on the
        contrary, an occasion of covetousness to others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Again, (2 Cor. xii. 14), St. Paul says, “ I will not be burdensome
        unto you. I do not seek the things that are yours, but you.” Likewise
        (Philip. iv. 17) he writes: “Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the
        fruit.” The Gloss says: “By the gift is meant the things given, such as
        money, food and the like; the fruit signifies the good works, and the
        upright intention of the giver.” True preachers then ought not to seek
        temporal gifts from their hearers. For this reason, the ought not to
        live by begging.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On the words: “the farmer who labours” etc. (2 Tim. ii.), the Gloss
        says: “The Apostle desires the evangelist to understand that he may
        accept that which is needful from them for whom he labours in God, whom
        he cultivates as a vinedresser tends his vine, and whom he feeds as a
        shepherd feeds his flock For to act thus is a right; it is not beggary.”
        Hence we see that those who preach the Gospel have a claim to live by
        it; and that they are not mendicants when they do so. But this right
        belongs only to prelates, and, therefore, other preachers ought not to
        live by the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. St. Paul (1 Cor. ix.), wishing to show that it was lawful for him to
        accept alms from the faithful, first proves that he is an Apostle. Those
        who are not Apostles, have no right to live by the charity of the
        faithful. Preaching religious, not being prelates, are not Apostles;
        therefore they do not have this right.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The Gloss, commenting on the words of 1 These. ii, “whereas we might
        have been burthensome to you as the Apostles of Christ,” says: “St. Paul
        points out the hypocrisy of the false prophets, by refusing to ask for
        the support which he might justly have claimed, in order to rebuke those
        who, although they had no right to ask for assistance, blushed not to do
        so. He speaks of this Apostolic claim to the alms of the faithful as “a
        burden,” in allusion to the false prophets who unlawfully usurped the
        right of asking for charity, and importunately urged their pretended
        claims.” It thus becomes plain that they who require the faithful to
        support them must, as they are not Apostles, be accounted to be false
        prophets. Therefore, preachers who are not prelates, ought not to beg.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Preachers who are not prelates either have, or have not, a right to
        be maintained by those to whom they preach. If they possess this right,
        they can enforce it by coercion. This idea is, of course, absurd. If
        they have no right to such support, they are begging unlawfully and
        unjustly; and they ought, as we have just shown from the Gloss, to be
        counted as false prophets.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Prelates who receive from the laity tithes and offerings are bound to
        provide for their spiritual needs. Hence if others be commissioned by
        bishops to minister to the faithful and to receive alms from them, it is
        unfair to the people. For it is the bishops, and not the people, who
        ought to provide for the wants of those whom they send.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Prelates who commission others to preach are bound to supply their
        necessities (<i>Extra de offic., ord. Inter caetera</i>). If then the
        preachers demand offerings from their bearers, they are doing them an
        injustice; for they ought not to accept remuneration from them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Our Lord says to the Pharisees (Matt. xxiii 14), “Woe to you scribes
        and Pharisees, hypocrites, who devour the houses of widows, praying loug
        prayers.” Those are equally reprehensible who beg for alms, under the
        pretext of praying, or preaching, or of any other act of the like
        nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Christ, when He sent forth His disciples to preach, said to them:
        “Into whatever city or town you shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy
        “ (Matt. x. 11). The Gloss says on this verse, “We must choose our host
        by the testimony of his neighbours, lest his bad life should cause our
        preaching to be neglected.” Again, “He is worthy to entertain us, who
        understands that thereby he receives, rather than confers, a favour.”
        Hence it is highly reprehensible for preachers to condescend to wealthy
        sinners, and to those who do not esteem their abode with them to be a
        favour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. He who barters a spiritual for a temporal good commits the sin of
        simony, whether, like Giezi, he asks for a gift, or whether a gift be
        offered to him, like that which Elisha refused to accept from Naaman (4
        Kings v.). The sin is equal, whether it be before or after the work that
        the gift is accepted (<i>I, q. I. cap. Eos</i>). Now he who preaches to
        the people exercises a spiritual ministry towards them. Hence a preacher
        should not accept their temporal gifts, whether he asks for them, or
        whether they offer them without being asked.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. St. Paul says: “From all appearance of evil refrain yourselves” (1
        Thes. v. 22). The Gloss adds: “If something appears to be wrong,
        although it be not actually wrong, do not do it impulsively.” Now it has
        a bad appearance for a preacher to seek material assistance from those
        to whom he preaches. Hence St. Paul said: “I seek not those things which
        are yours, but you” (2 Cor. xii). For, as the Gloss observes, “ the
        Apostle, lest he might seem to sell the Gospel, desired not gifts, but
        fruit.” In like manner, preachers ought not to beg for a livelihood from
        those to whom they preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our opponents, also, attempt to prove that alms ought not to be given to
        religious.

        1. They, quote the words from Luke (xiv. 13), “When you make a feast,
        call the poor, the maimed, the lame and the blind.” “From whom,” as the
        Gloss says, “there is nothing to be expected.” But you might gain
        something from strong and healthy beggars, who are often the parasites
        of rich men. Therefore, we ought not to give to the latter class of
        mendicant.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. St. Augustine writes to Vincent the Donatist that “it is better to
        deprive a hungry man of food, than to give bread to one who, being sure
        of a livelihood, will forsake justice. For by succouring such a one, we
        connive at his evildoing.” Now he who will not work for his living when
        he is able, or he who can get food in a lawful manner without begging
        and yet prefers to beg, acts unjustly. Hence alms should not be bestowed
        upon him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The Gloss on the words, “ Give to every one who asks of you,” (Luke
        vi.) says, “Give him what he wants or a reproof.” Again, on the words,
        “Give to him who asks you” (Matt. v.), the Gloss says: “Give in such a
        way as to injure neither yourself nor another. For justice should be
        balanced. Thus, you should give to every one who asks you, if not what
        he asks for, then some better thing, namely, a rebuke for asking
        wrongfully.” Now as we have shown, he who prefers begging to manual
        labour begs unjustly; and he deserves reproof rather than alms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. St. Augustine, in his letter to the Donatist Vincent, says, “The evil
        have often persecuted the good, and the good have persecuted the evil.
        The evil persecuted the good by injustice; and the good persecute the
        bad by correction.” Hence for the sake of correction, the good may
        persecute the bad; and to deprive them of food is a species of
        correction. Now sturdy beggars sin, even though they preach; and
        therefore, they ought to be deprived of food.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. St. Ambrose (<i>I De offic.</i>) says: “In giving charity, we must
        take into consideration the age of the one who asks of us, his health
        and the boldness with which he begs. For shame in asking for alms often
        betrays the nobility of him who asks. We must give more abundantly to
        the aged, who cannot gain a living by the labour of their hands. The
        sick, likewise should be promptly relieved; and those who have fallen
        form wealth into poverty, not by their own fault, but through robbery or
        proscription or calumny.” Now robust beggars are neither infirm in
        health nor shamefaced; neither have they lost their property through
        robbery or proscription. Therefore they should not be helped by charity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Alms should be given for the purpose of relieving indigence; and the
        greater the distress, the greater should be our liberality. But those
        who cannot work for their living and cannot get support by any other
        means are in much greater straits than are they who are able to obtain a
        livelihood. As long, therefore, as we find indigent persons belonging to
        hte first category, we should not give to those belonging to the second.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Alms-giving is a work of mercy. Therefore it is to be performed only
        in behalf of those in need. Now those who voluntarily reduce themselves
        to beggary are not in need. It is only those that are compelled to
        suffer penury who can be said to be in want. Aristotle says (<i
          >III Ethics</i
        >): “What is involuntary deserves forgiveness.” Hence alms are not to be
        bestowed on voluntary mendicants.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. St. Augustine says (<i>I De doctr. Christ.</i>): “As you cannot
        assist all, you should help those who are most closely bound to you by
        time or place or by some other circumstance.” Now our closest ties are
        to our neighbours and our kinsfolk. Therefore, as long as any of our
        friends are in need, we must not give alms to strangers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The errors which we have noted are no novelty. They appeared in the very
        early days of the Church. In 3 John iii we read, “Diotrephes, who loves
        to have pre-eminence among them, does not receive us.” Again, “and as if
        these things were not enough for him, neither does he himself receive
        the brethren,” <i>i.e.</i>, “the needy,” as the Gloss explains. “And
        those who do receive them he banishes and casts out of the church,”
        <i>i.e.</i>, “for fear that they should help the needy he does not let
        them go to their usual place of meeting” (Gloss). Another commentary on
        the same text says “You ought to persevere in almsgiving, for it is a
        work so profitable that I would have written in its praise not only to
        you, but to the whole Church. But this desire I was constrained to leave
        unfulfilled; for Diotrephes cares not for our authority.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Diotrephes, a heresiarch of the primitive times of the Church, taught,
        as we see from the text and the Gloss, that humanity has no claim on our
        care, and that we should not assist pilgrims who have left their own
        possessions. Vigilantius revived this heresy, as we learn from the
        Epistle of St. Jerome to Riparius and Desiderius against Vigilantius. In
        this Epistle he writes: “Further, I am informed, by the same epistles
        that contrary to the authority of the Apostle Paul, also of Peter, and
        of John and James, who held out to Paul and Barnabas the right hand of
        communication and commanded them to be mindful of the poor, that you
        forbid any sums to be sent to Jerusalem, for the benefit of the needy.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In combating these errors we shall proceed in the following manner:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. We shall prove that those who are poor because they have given up
        everything for God may live on alms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. We shall show that preachers, even though they be not prelates, may,
        when commissioned by bishops to preach, accept the charity of the
        faithful to whom they preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That, even though they are in robust health, they may beg.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. That they have a special right to the alms of the faithful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. We shall confute the arguments brought in support of the contrary
        propositions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The fact that those who are poor because they have renounced all
        things for Christ have a right to live on alms is proved by the example
        of St. Benedict. He, as St. Gregory tells us (<i>2 Diolog.</i>), lived
        for three years in a cave after he left his parents’ house, dependent on
        the ministry of the monk Romanus. He was in sound health, but we do not
        read that he worked for his living.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. In <i>I. q. II. Cap. Sacerdos</i>, it is laid down that “he who has
        either renounced all his property in favour of his kinsfolk, or has
        distributed it to the poor, or given it to the Church, and has thus, for
        love of poverty, made himself poor, is not only free from the guilt of
        covetousness if he accept assistance from the faithful; but that he may
        laudably do so, in order thereby to assist the poor, while he himself
        lives in voluntary poverty.” It is thus evident that a man who has
        renounced all things for Christ, may live on the charity of the
        faithful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. A man is bound rather to sacrifice some good, which he may relinquish
        without sin, than to commit sim If then they who are in robust health
        sin by taking alms, they ought to relinquish every other occupation,
        however good, rather than accept charity. This proposition is false, as
        we see by the words of St. Augustine in <i>De opere monachorum</i>. The
        Saint says that “those servants of God who work with their hands ought
        to have some time set apart in which to rest from labour, and to commit
        to memory what they ought to know. They ought, he says, to be assisted
        by the good offices of the faithful, in order that at the times devoted
        to learning, they may dot be depressed by want.” St. Augustine thus
        shows that, in his opinion, monks ought not to be entirely dependent on
        labour for their daily bread; otherwise no opportunity would be afforded
        them for spiritual exercises.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. In the same work, St. Augustine, referring to a certain rich man who
        had given all his wealth to a monastery, says that “he performed a good
        work by labouring with his hands, in order to give an example; although,
        by the benefit which he had conferred on the community, he had a right
        to be supported by it. For, had he been unwilling to work, who would
        have dared to urge him to do so?” Hence we see that he who bestows his
        substance on a monastery, has a right to live in that monastery without
        manual labour. But the Saint further remarks that as all Christians form
        one republic, it is of no consequence to which section of the
        commonwealth each one gives his money, nor from whom he derives support.
        Hence they who have left all things for Christ may accept the
        necessities of life from anyone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The intention of refraining from a deed, bad in itself, does not
        diminish the intrinsic evil of the deed, though it may lessen the sin
        committed. If, therefore, it is in itself sinful for a man who is able
        to work to live on alms, those who, although in good health, intend to
        live for a time on charity, intending at other times to live by other
        means, cannot be excused from sin. Pilgrims, therefore, who beg on their
        pilgrimages, commit sin. Sin is likewise committed by those who enjoin
        pilgrimages. This supposition is of course absurd.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. It is more meritorious in a man to devote himself to divine
        contemplation than to the study of philosophy. Some men, however, do,
        without sin, live for a time on charity in order to pursue such study.
        Therefore, it is permissible for others to live for a time on alms, in
        order to devote themselves to divine contemplation. But, it is more
        praiseworthy in a man to consecrate himself perpetually to contemplation
        than temporarily to study. Consequently it is lawful for men to set
        aside manual labour and to live, absorbed in contemplation, on the alms
        of the faithful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Christian charity forms a closer bond than does political friendship.
        Now if anyone makes me a present, I am justified in making any use of it
        that I choose. It is then even more permissible for me to live by the
        things that are given me, for the love of Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. If it be lawful to accept what is greater, it is still more allowable
        to receive that which isless. But religious are permitted to receive a
        certain income (<i>mille marcharum</i>) and to live on it without manual
        labour. Were such not the case, many communities that are in possession
        of large properties would be in a state of damnation. For the same
        reason, many of the secular clergy who have no care of souls, live on
        ecclesiastical possessions, which are the gifts of the faithful. Hence
        it is absurd to say that poor religious may not accept small alms and
        live thereby, without manual labour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. The poor who are unable to work are more grossly defrauded, if what
        is their due is given to others, than if those others receive what they
        have a claim to. Now the income of ecclesiastical property is intended
        be given to the poor (<i>XII, quaest. I, cap. Videntes</i>). Hence it is
        laid down (<i>I, quaest. II, cap. Clericus & cap. Si quis</i>) that
        “clerics who can live on their own patrimony cannot, without sin, live
        on the goods of the Church, which are destined for the support of the
        poor.” Hence a greater injustice is committed against the poor, if those
        who, although in good health, do no manual labour, and yet live on
        ecclesiastical property, than if the poor of Christ live by the private
        offerings of the faithful, which are not the right of the poor. If those
        in the first category do not defraud the poor, those who are in the
        second most certainly do not do so. In our treatise on manual labour
        will be found many other arguments in proof of the same point.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our next task will be to show that preachers, although, they be not
        prelates, may accept for their maintenance alms from those to whom they
        preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. St. Paul writes to the Corinthians (1 Cor. ix. 7), “Who ever serves
        as a soldier at his own charges? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat
        of its fruit? Who feeds the flock and does not eat of the milk of the
        flock?” St. Paul alleges these examples (as the Gloss remarks) in order
        to prove that the Apostles did not claim more than was their due if,
        according to the precept of our Lord, they who preached the Gospel lived
        by it, and likewise freely accepted the charity of those to whom they
        freely ministered. Now it is quite certain that a soldier, and a
        vinedresser, and a herdsman, ought to live by the fruit of their toil.
        Therefore, as not only prelates, but all preachers, labour to announce
        the Gospel, they have a right to accept the means of subsistence from
        those among whom they labour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Paul likewise maintains that the Apostles has a right to accept
        temporal assistance from those to whom they ministered spiritual good.
        For it is not out of order for him who gives great things to receive
        small things in exchange. To quote St. Paul’s own words, “If we have
        sown for you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your
        carnal things? (1 Cor. ix. 2). “Now the spiritual truths taught by
        prelates are proclaimed, equally by all preachers bearing an episcopal
        commission. There is therefore no reason why they, as well as prelates,
        should not accept material means of support.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In the first Chapter of the Epistle just quoted, St. Paul likewise
        says: “The Lord has ordained that they who preach the Gospel should also
        live by the Gospel.” The Gloss observes: “The reason why this command
        was given was to render preachers more diligent in their office. “Now
        all (not only prelates) whose duty it is to preach ought to be zealous
        in so doing. Therefore, the rule laid down by our Lord applies not only
        to prelates, but to all who preach the word of God. This is plain by the
        very words of St. Paul. He does not say, “all who have ordinary
        authority to preach,” but, “those who preach the Gospel.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. When our Lord sent forth His disciples to preach, He said: “Remain in
        the same house, eating and drinking such things as they have. For the
        labourer is worthy of his hire.” This passage proves that preachers earn
        their living, as payment due to them, from those to whom they preach The
        following observation from, the Gloss renders this proposition still
        more clear. “A preacher is entitled to two rewards for his one work. One
        reward he receives on earth, in the support afforded to him in his
        labour; the other reward awaits him in heaven, in a glorious
        resurrection.” Now reward is due not to power, nor to authority, nor to
        habit, but to deed; for deeds alone are meritorious. Aristotle says (<i
          >I Ethic.</i
        >): “As in the Olympian games, the crown was given not to the strongest
        nor to the noblest, but to those who fought most strenuously and who,
        therefore, were victorious; so they are rightly deemed the most
        illustrious who in life have done the best and bravest deeds.” St, Paul
        again says: “he... is not crowned, unless he strives lawfully.” They,
        therefore, whether prelates or not, who legitimately preach the Gospel,
        may lawfully live by it (2 Tim. 11. 5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. They who are sent by bishops to preach, labour more than do the
        others of the order from which they are sent, or than they who, at the
        bidding of a bishop, send them. But it is lawful for the rest of an
        order to live on the alms given to its preachers, even though those
        preachers be not prelates. This is proved by the following words: “It
        has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution for the
        poor saints that are in Jerusalem. For it has pleased them, and they are
        their debtors. For, if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their
        spiritual things” (<i>i.e.</i>, according to the Gloss, “partakers of
        the spiritual advantages of the Jews who had sent them preachers from
        Jerusalem”), “they ought also in carnal things to minister to them” (Rom
        xv. 26). Now by the “poor” of whom St. Paul here speaks, we cannot
        understand the Apostles. For, as they were only twelve in number, and
        were content with little, they did not need a collection to be made for
        them in all the Churches, especially as we know that they were supported
        by those to whom they preached (1 Cor. ix). Hence all preachers, even
        though they are not bishops, but are sent by bishops, have a right to
        live by the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. They who, by episcopal commission, are employed in preaching are of
        far greater use to bishops in spreading the word of God, than are they
        who are engaged in other functions of the ministry. Now prelates who
        preach may accept alms, not only for themselves, but for their
        households. More justly then may they who preach by episcopal
        commission, accept from the faithful the means of subsistence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. He who gives to another <i>gratis</i> what he is not obliged to give,
        has as good a right to take a reward as he who does merely what he is
        obliged to do. Now it is a bounden duty for bishops to minister to their
        flocks in spiritual matters. For, as St. Paul says: “If I preach the
        Gospel, it is no glory to me, for an obligation lies on me; for woe to
        me if I do not preach the Gospel” (1 Cor. ix, 16). They therefore who
        are not prelates, and have not the responsibility of a flock, are
        justified in accepting material assistance from those to whom they
        preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. St. Augustine says in <i>De opere monachorum</i>: “ If they
        (<i>i.e.</i>, religious) are preachers of the Gospel, I admit their
        right,” <i>i.e.</i> to live on the alms of the faithful. But these words
        apply not only to prelates, but to all who can preach, even to deacons.
        Hence St. Paul says (Eph. iv. 11): “He gave some Apostles, and some
        prophets, and some evangelists, and some others pastors and doctors.”
        The Apostle thus draws a distinction between Evangelists and Pastors and
        Apostles, by which term we are to understand prelates. Hence all
        preachers, be they prelates or not, may live by the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Preaching is the noblest of all ecclesiastical functions.“Our Lord
        declared that this was the purpose of His coming into the world. “For
        this was I sent” (Luke iv. 43). Isaiah also, speaking in the person of
        Christ, says: “He sent me to preach to the meek” (Isa. lxi. 1). St. Paul
        likewise says: “Christ sent me not to baptise, but to preach the Gospel”
        (1 Cor. i. 17). Now they who are engaged in the business of the Church
        ought not to work with their hands, but to live on the property of the
        Church, as St. Augustine says (<i>De opere Monach.</i>), speaking of
        himself. This rule applies much more forcibly to those engaged in
        preaching, who have every right to live by the Gospel, instead of by
        manual labour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The office of a preacher is more useful to the community than is
        that of a lawyer. But lawyers may, from the legitimate exercise of their
        profession, earn a livelihood. Therefore, preachers, may, if their
        preaching be authorised, live by means of it, whether they be prelates
        or not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Although alms cannot be given out of money made by usury, preachers
        may, nevertheless, accept alms from money thus gained, provided they
        cannot, without so doing, remain in a place inhabited by usurers. The
        reason for this concession is that preachers, by inducing usurers to
        restore their illgotten gains, are directing the affairs of those to
        whom this money is due. This is distinctly established in the decretal
        <i>Extra de sent. excom., cap. cum voluntate</i>. But preachers are, in
        like manner, occupied with the affairs of all men, both rich and poor,
        when they urge the rich to give alms to the poor and to perform other
        salutary works. Hence they are justified in accepting alms from those to
        whom they preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. We see that in mechanical trades, it is not they only who work with
        their hands who live by the trade, but the architect who directs their
        labour profits by it likewise. Now the man who teaches morals is, so to
        speak, the architect of all human duties (<i>I Ethic.</i>). Therefore,
        preachers have a right to live by their preaching, even though they do
        not work with their hands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. Health of soul is to be preferred before health of body. Physicians
        live without manual labour by giving advice to their patients. Therefore
        those who are engaged about the spiritual welfare of others have a right
        to accept alms for their maintenance, even though they do not labour
        with their hands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our next task will be to show that preachers may not only live by alms
        freely offered to them, but that they may likewise beg for charity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. This is proved by the example of Christ, speaking in whose person the
        Psalmist says: “But I am a beggar and poor” (Ps. xxxix. 18). The Gloss
        remarks on this text: “Christ speaks thus of Himself in the form of a
        servant.” Again: “A beggar is one who asks from another; a poor man one
        who has not enough for himself.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. In Ps. lxix. 6, we find the words: “But I am needy and poor.” On
        which the Gloss says: “I am needy”; <i>i.e.</i>, begging, and poor,
        <i>i.e.</i>, “I do not have te means to support myself.” He who speaks
        thus owns no material wealth; and, having spiritual riches, he ever
        desires more, craves for it, and receives it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In Ps. lviii. 6 we read: “He persecutes the poor man and the beggar,”
        i.e. “ Christ,” as the Gloss expounds it. Another commentary says: “It
        is pure malice to persecute the poor. Rich men may sometimes suffer
        persecution on account of their position or wealth.” Both these
        commentaries show that the words of the Psalm are understood as being an
        allusion to material poverty.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. St. Paul says (2 Cor. viii. 9): You know the grace of our Lord Jesus
        Christ that, being rich, He became poor for your sakes,” i.e., “in the
        world” (Gloss). That the poverty of Christ ought to be imitated is
        proved by the Gloss in the following words: “Let no one despise himself.
        He who inhabits a poor dwelling is rich in conscience, and he sleeps
        more peacefully on the ground, than the wealthy man can rest amidst his
        gold and purple. Fear not then in your misery, to approach Him who has
        put on our poverty.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. our Lord asked for hospitality. We know this by His words to
        Zacchaeus: “ Come down quickly; for today I must abide in your house”
        (Luke xix. 5). The Gloss says: “He offers Himself, although He has not
        been invited. For He knew the disposition of Zacchaeus’ heart, although
        he had uttered no word of invitation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. We read in St. Mark xi. “Having viewed all things round about, when
        now the eventide was come.” The Gloss understands these words to mean: “
        having looked all around Him to see if any would offer Him hospitality.
        For He was so poor and so carefully avoided flattering any man that He
        found none to shelter Him in all that large city.” Hence we see that the
        poverty of our Lord was so extreme that He possessed nothing with which
        to hire a lodging, but sought and hoped for hospitality from others. It
        is, therefore, blasphemous to say that it is unlawful to beg.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The same lesson is taught by the example of the Apostles. They were
        instructed by our Lord not to take with them on their way what they
        needed for their journey (Matt. x, Mark vi, Luke ix). They could not
        have taken what they needed as a right; they must, therefore, have
        begged for it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Again, the same fact is made evident by the conduct of the Apostles
        after the resurrection of Christ. St. John says (3 Eph. v. 7.): “For his
        name, they went out” (“away,” as the Gloss expresses it), “taking
        nothing from the Gentiles.” Hence they went forth without the
        necessities of life. These, therefore, they must have gained by begging,
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. A man is more strictly bound to provide for himself than for others.
        Now the Apostles asked for alms for “the poor of the saints who were in
        Jerusalem.” If then it be lawful to beg for our brethren, it is equally
        right to do so for ourselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The example of St. Alexis shows that mendicancy is permissible. This
        Saint, having renounced all things for the love of Christ, lived not by
        work, but by begging. He asked for alms even from the servants whom his
        father sent to seek him; and he thanked God that he received chanty from
        them. His sanctity was made known by a voice from Heaven. This voice was
        heard by the Pope, by the Emperors Arcadius and Honorius, and by the
        people of Rome assembled in the basilica of St. Peter. The voice
        announced that the preservation of Rome was due to the merits of Alexis.
        After the death of the Saint, his fame was spread by means of many
        miracles; and he was canonised. His feast is solemnly observed by the
        whole Roman Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. St. Jerome, writing to Oceanus in praise of Fabiola, says of her
        that “she desired to sacrifice her riches and to live on charity.” Had
        this wish been sinful on her part, she could not have been commended for
        it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. What is unlawful cannot be imposed by this Church as a penance. But
        for certain grave offences, a sinner may be enjoined to make a
        pilgrimage and to beg his way. Hence mendicancy is not sinful, but may
        be a penitential exercise. It may, therefore, be practised, together
        with other works of penance, for the love of God, and as a means to
        perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. As vigils, fasting and suchlike macerations of the flesh are
        employed as means to combat concupiscence, so everything that tends
        towards humiliation diminishes pride, which is as much to be avoided as
        lust, since, as St. Gregory says, spiritual sins are the more heinous.
        Now no penitential exercise can be more humiliating than mendicancy, for
        man is naturally ashamed of begging. Hence as fasting and watching,
        regarded in the light of bridles to concupiscence, pertain to the state
        of perfection; mendicancy likewise, embraced for the love of Christ and
        for the sake of humility, pertains to the same state.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. Again, the charity of Christ is more liberal than is the friendship
        of the world. Now even in human friendship, friends make no difficulty
        about asking each other for what they need, particularly in cases where
        some return can be made for what is given. The form in which such return
        is made is of no consequence, as the philosopher says (<i>V Ethic.</i>).
        Hence it is permissible for a man, even though he be in good health, to
        ask for the love of God for what he needs, especially as he can make a
        return to the donor by prayers and spiritual works.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. It is lawful to ask another for a favour, if, by so doing, we give
        him a chance of improving his condition. Now by giving alms, a man
        betters his condition by meriting eternal life. Hence it cannot be
        unlawful to ask for charity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. The needs of the poor cannot be relieved unless they be known; and
        they cannot be known unless they be revealed. Hence if it is right for
        any to be in a state of destitution, it is right for them to beg for
        what they need. But, as we have already proved, it is lawful for men to
        reduce themselves to such poverty for the love of God that even (as St.
        Augustine says in <i>De opere monachorum</i>) their manual labour does
        not suffice to support them. It is, therefore, justifiable in them to
        beg.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We shall now prove that it is right to give alms to mendicant religious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. St. John says (3 John), “Dearly beloved, do faithfully whatever you
        do for the brethrens and for strangers.” He immediately points out to
        whom he refers by saying: “For his name they went out” (i.e., “ leaving
        their own possessions,” Gloas). And again, “We, therefore, ought to
        receive such.” The Gloss here remarks: “John had renounced all things,
        but he speaks of himself as belonging to the number of the rich, in
        order to make those whom he addresses more prompt and more ready in
        helping the needy.” Hence it is praiseworthy to give alms to those who,
        for the love of Christ, live without possessions of their own.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. We read in Matt. x. 41, “He who receives a just man in the name of a
        just man shall receive the reward of a just man.” The Gloss remarks that
        “on this account he is called just.” The Gloss also adds, “Someone may
        therefore say: ‘We shall thus receive false prophets, and the traitor
        Judas.’ But the Lord, foreseeing this objection, says not that persons
        are to be received but their names; and that he who receives another
        shall not be deprived of a reward on account of the unworthiness of the
        object of his charity.” Hence we must conclude that alms are to be given
        to those who bear, even though unjustly, the name of sanctity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. St. Paul (Rom. xv.) praises the faithful of Macedonia and Achaia for
        their resolution to make a collection for the poor among the saints. The
        Gloss remarks hereon: “These men devoted themselves wholly to the Divine
        service, heeding no worldly matters, and caring only to set an example
        of holy living to those who believed.” The Achaians and Macedonians had
        made a collection for these good men; and St. Paul invites the Romans to
        do the same. Hence we see that alms may be given to the poor of Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The Gloss says, commenting on the words (2 Cor. vii), “let your
        abundance supply their want,” <i>i.e.</i>, “the want of those who have
        renounced all earthly things.” These words are a further confirmation of
        the opinion which we have already expressed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Again, on the words, “But you, brethren, be not weary of well doing”
        (1 Thes. iii. 14), the Gloss observes that “‘well doing’ here signifies
        doing good to the poor.” Another commentary says: “Because, although
        they work, they are still in need of certain things. Thus, St. Paul
        warns the faithful that if they have the means of supplying the
        necessities of the servants of God, they should not be remiss in so
        doing.” A man cannot be blamed for generosity; he, only, deserves a
        rebuke who, while able to work, prefers to lead an idle life. Hence it
        is praiseworthy to give alms to the servants of God, whether they work
        or not, even though they may be to. blame for not working.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. St. Jerome says, when writing against Vigilantius: “We do not deny
        that if anyone is able to do so and is generously minded, he may give
        alms to all poor men, even to Samaritans and Jews. The Apostle teaches
        that charity is to be given to all men, but chiefly to those who are of
        the household of the Faith. It is of such that our Lord says: ‘Make
        friends with the mammon of iniquity, who will receive you into
        everlasting dwellings.’ But can these poor persons, whose physical
        degradation corresponds with their mental depravity, receive us into
        everlasting dwellings, when they possess no home at the present time and
        have no hope of any habitation in the future? It is not simply the poor,
        but the poor in spirit, that are called ‘blessed.’ And it is of such
        that the Psalmist writes: ‘Blessed is the man who understands concerning
        the needy and the poor’ (Ps. xi.). In order to succour the ordinary
        poor, alms are necessary, not understanding. In order to assist the holy
        poor mentioned in the beatitude, there must be intelligence, in order
        that alms may be given to him who is grieved and ashamed to accept them,
        and who, reaping material advantage, sows spiritual good.” Hence we see
        that it is better to give alms to the poor who are holy than to any
        others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. On the words, “he has dispersed abroad, he has given to the poor,” (2
        Cor. ix.), the Gloss thus comments: “If the reward of him who gives to
        the poor is great, how much greater shall be the prize awarded to him
        who ministers to the saints? For anyone may be poor, even though he be
        wicked.” This is a further argument, in favour of the opinion that we
        have just expressed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. St. Jerome comments thus on the words: “Let him who is instructed in
        the word communicate to him who instructs him” (Gal. vi. 6): “St. Paul
        commands that were infirm disciples and carnal men, to contribute to the
        material needs of the masters from whom they have received spiritual
        instruction, and who, being entirely devoted to study, lack the
        necessities of life.” Hence we see that alms are to be given not to such
        as work with their hands, but to those that are engaged in the study of
        the Scripture.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. St. Jerome likewise writes to Paulinus: “He is rather to be
        considered a courtier than a monk, who always, or often, talks of money,
        and who takes no heed of the alms which belong to all.” From which words
        it is evident that alms are to be given to monks and to all others, and
        that monks have a right to speak of asking for charity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. We read in <i>decret. dist. xlii</i>: “If any man contemn those who
        faithfully prepare the <i>agapes</i>, or banquets of the poor, and call
        the brethren together for the glory of God, and despises the work they
        do, let such an one be anathema.” It is, therefore, a crime worthy of
        excommunication, to condemn the practice of almsgiving.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. We read in Prov. xxi. 13: “He who stops his ear against the cry of
        the poor shall also cry himself, and he shall not be heard.” The Gloss
        observes: “These words refer to the poor considered generally, not only
        to the sick or destitute. For he who prefers to judge his neighbour,
        rather than to pity his sinfulness, shows that he himself is not free
        from guilt, nor worthy to be beard by the Divine mercy.” Alms then are
        to be given to all who are poor, even though they are in robust health.

        12. On the words of Ps. ciii: “Bringing forth grass for cattle, and
        herbs for the service of men,” the Gloss says: “The, earth, being
        fertile, was able to provide grass (<i>i.e.</i>, material subsistence)
        for cattle (<i>i.e.</i>, for Preachers), in order that they who preach
        the Gospel may live by the Gospel. If the earth does not bring forth
        this temporal support for preachers it is barren. If it produces these
        material good things it is bearing fruit.” And again: “Preachers have a
        right to material assistance, since they impart spiritual gifts. It is
        of these that it is written: ‘Blessed is he who anticipates the voice of
        him who asks.’ You should not act towards the ox that treads the grain
        as you act towards the beggar who passes by. You give to the one who
        asks, for you have read, ‘Give to him who asks of you!’ But you should
        likewise give to him who does not ask.” Again, the Gloss says: “Give to
        every one who asks, whoever he may be, recognising in his person Him to
        Whom you give. But, much more, give to the servant of God, the soldier
        of Christ, who does not ask.” Hence we see that if we are to bestow alms
        on all the poor, even on those who do not beg for them, preachers ought
        in an especial manner to be assisted by those who hear them.

        13. In St. Luke xvi. 9 we read: “Make yourselves friends with the mammon
        of iniquity.” Here the Gloss remarks: “This text does not refer to the
        poor indiscriminately, but to those who can receive us unto everlasting
        dwellings.” Now the poor of Christ, beyond all others, can receive us
        into everlasting dwellings, for they, together with Christ, will be our
        judges. Therefore, it is especially to these that we should give alms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We must now reply to the objections of our opponents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. To the argument that “temporal possessions blind the eyes of the
        wise,” we reply that temporal possessions may be understood in a twofold
        sense. First they may be considered as hoarded up. Now to accept them in
        order thus to treasure them is an act of covetousness which blinds the
        eyes of the soul and causes it to decline from justice. But temporal
        things may also be accepted in order to supply necessary food and
        clothing; and to accept them for this reason is not cupidity and does
        not blind the eyes of the soul. This distinction is grounded on the
        words of St. Paul (1 Tim. vi. 8): “Having food and wherewith to be
        covered, with these we are content.” The Gloss remarks: “He who goes
        beyond that finds what is evil.” Hence it is added: “For those who would
        become rich fall into temptation and into the snare of the devil.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. There are two kinds of slavery, namely, the slavery of fear and the
        slavery of love. He who accepts gifts from cupidity is enslaved by fear;
        for the things acquired by cupidity are possessed in fear. Now we ought
        to be free from this servitude and we ought to be the servants of
        Christ. For, as St. Paul says (Rom. viii. 15), “You have not received
        the spirit of bondage again in fear.” They who accept gifts in charity
        are the bondsmen of love, and the servants of Christ are not free from
        this bondage. Hence St. Paul says (2 Cor. iv. 5), “We preach not
        ourselves, but Jesus Christ our Lord, and ourselves your servants,
        through Jesus.” Hence he who, in order to fulfil the duties of charity,
        accepts alms for his bodily sustenance, incurs not a bondage unworthy of
        the servants of Christ, but only such as befits the servants of the
        Lord.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        S. The act of giving is, in itself, more meritorious than that of
        receiving. Hence Aristotle says (<i>IV Ethic.</i>), “The act of
        liberality is greater in giving than in receiving, although a liberal
        man may both give and receive. There is nothing, however, to prevent the
        act of receiving from being, at times, from some special circumstance,
        the more commendable. It would then although exceptionally, be more
        praiseworthy than that of giving.” If then nothing is considered in a
        poor man, save the fact that he accepts charity, the rich man who gives
        the alms, is more blessed than the poor man who receives it, But
        circumstances may render the recipient of charity more meritorious, than
        the giver. Thus a man who, for the love of Christ, has made himself
        voluntarily poor and accepts alms is more blessed than the rich man who
        bestows the gift. Hence the Gloss remarks: “The Lord does not prefer
        rich men who give alms to the poor who have renounced all for His sake;
        but He gives the greatest glory to those who, after forsaking all their
        possessions, labour with their hands in order to have something to give
        to those in need.” Now this conduct is certainly very commendable in
        those who are not engaged in more important occupations. And, it would
        be most perfect, if religious, without detriment to such occupation
        could, as we have before said, perform some manual labour and give their
        earnings in charity. But religious are not bound to do everything that
        is perfect; they are only bound to accomplish what their vows oblige
        them to.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. It is no burden to the Church if religious live on alms, seeing that
        although they produce great fruits in the Church, their wants are very
        small. In fact, such religious do, in reality, lighten the expenses of
        the Church; for they perform at very small cost labour for which others,
        who are not satisfied with so little, would require much larger sums.
        Neither do mendicant orders deprive the poor of their rights; for, by
        their counsel and influence, much larger sums are given to the poor than
        they themselves receive. And further, these religious before entering
        their monastery, gave away all their goods to the poor, who have thus
        received far more than the alms bestowed on mendicant orders.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The decree cited in this objection is misquoted. This is evident by
        the words of Gratian, given in the next chapter. These authorities
        forbid the Church to receive not such as were originally rich but left
        all things, as did Peter, Matthew and Paul, or who, like Zwehaeus,
        distributed their goods to the poor, or presented them to the Church, as
        did the early Christians who sold all that they had, and laid the price
        at the feet of the Apostles. What is forbidden to the Church is to
        receive those who, while living in the house of their parents, or
        refusing to sacrifice their patrimony, desire at the mine time to enjoy
        ecclesiastical benefices.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. St. Augustine speaks of those religious who live idle lives and,
        being of no use to those who maintain them, are forced to gain their
        bread by flattery. For no one will support a useless person unless his
        favour be secured by adulation. But those religious to whom charity is
        extended for the love of Christ and who, in exchange for material
        assistance, confer spiritual benefits, have no need to flatter their
        benefactors. For those who relieve them do so for the love of Christ,
        who has said, “he who receives you, receives Me” (Matt. x. 40). Now as
        the Gloss says, “nothing is received in the Apostles save what is in
        Christ.” Hence they who, for the love of God, become poor, and beg and
        live on alms need not resort to flattery. Those who are really driven to
        servility and adulation are wealthy sycophants who, in order to preserve
        and increase their riches, are obliged to flatter the sovereigns on
        whom, they depend. Thus St. Chrysostom writes, (<i>super Matth.</i>):
        “Princes and soldiers and subjects are obliged to flatter, and to stand
        in need of many things. They are reduced to ignominious servility; they
        live in fear; hence they are exposed to the suspicion and calumny of
        those that envy them. Far other is the lot of the poor.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. It is true that to receive is not an act of liberality (excepting in
        so far as receiving stands in relation to giving). But, in those who,
        for the love of Christ, have made themselves poor, it is an act of
        humility to accept as alms the necessities of life; and humility is a
        greater virtue than liberality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. St. Augustine, in the place quoted in the objection, had two reasons
        for rebuking monks who desired to live on alms. First, he reproved them
        for failing into the error of believing manual labour to be contrary to
        the evangelical precept: “Be not solicitous for your body” (Matt. vi.
        25). Secondly, he reproached them for the sloth which caused them to
        desire to escape from the laborious lives which they had led in the
        world. He says that it by no means suits artisans to be idle in a life
        where senators work hard. He does not, however, forbid those who in the
        world lived on their own income, or those occupied in ecclesiastical
        offices, to live on alms after the example of the early Christians of
        the Church of Jerusalem. This is plain to anyone who will read his words
        with care. Religious are not forbidden to live like poor men on alms,
        even though they cannot, by preaching, claim a right to do so. For
        charity is given with a different intention to the preacher and to the
        mendicant, as the Gloss observes on the words in Ps. cxiii., “bringing
        forth grass for cattle.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Prelates who preach the Gospel have, as we have said, a right to
        accept the necessities of life from their subjects. For recompense is
        due not to power or authority, but to labour. Likewise, when religious
        preach by episcopal authority, it stands to reason that they must be
        assisted by those to whom they minister. But there are other reasons
        which make it fitting that religious should have their wants supplied by
        the charity of the faithful. They have left all things for Christ. They
        minister at the altar, and the Holy sacrifice profits all men. They also
        devote themselves to the study of Holy Scripture, to prayer, to
        contemplation, and to other spiritual exercises which are all beneficial
        to the whole Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. There is nothing inconsistent in the fact that one man accepts
        assistance as his due, and that another receives it as a favour and
        charity. The alms given to a preacher are but the just return for his
        labour; but assistance may be rendered to all poor men, not as their due
        recompense, but out of a spirit of charity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. More harm was done in the Church by the teaching of the false
        prophets, from whom St. Paul, by labouring with his hands, took away the
        occasion of living on the charity of the faithful, than was done by the
        Apostle’s supporting himself by his own labour. Now on the contrary, the
        Church derives profit from the example of humility set by the mendicant
        orders who live on alms and devote themselves to the salvation of souls
        instead of to manual labour. This advantage outweighs the harm done by a
        few men who live on charity as an excuse for their sloth. There is,
        therefore, no reason why the poor of the Church should cease to receive
        alms, in order to take away the occasion of those who make bad use of
        them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. It was the custom amongst the Jews that their teachers should be
        maintained by the people. At the preaching of the Gospel, this custom
        became general among the faithful. When the Gentiles were first
        converted, the Apostles refused to ask or accept assistance from them,
        fearing lest they might take scandal. There is now, however, no reason
        to fear such scandal. Indeed, the example of moderation in food and
        clothing set by religious, is a subject rather of edification than of
        scandal. They who profess to be scandalized at the sight of religious
        accepting alms are like the Pharisee who, as we are told in St. Matt.
        xv., took scandal at our Lord, and whom He told His disciples to ignore.
        The case would be very different were religious to accept alms, not in
        order to provide for themselves the necessities of life, but for the
        sake of amassing wealth or of indulging in riotous living.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. To the thirteenth objection, we may reply, as St. Jerome replied to
        Vigilantius that according to the same reasoning virginity is not a good
        thing, “for if all were virgins, the human race would cease.” Again,
        “virtue is rare and desired by few; it would be wonderful if all men
        resembled those few of whom it is said: ‘many indeed are called but few
        are chosen.’” This is the answer to the thirteenth objection. The works
        of perfection are so difficult that but very few attempt to accomplish
        them. There is, therefore, no grounds for fearing that the world will
        cease to exist on account of the perfection of its inhabitants.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We must now proceed to answer the arguments of those who maintain that
        it is not lawful to seek alms by begging.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The words: “ There shall be no poor man and no beggar amongst you,”
        do not forbid persons to embrace the condition of poverty and mendicity.
        These words prohibit men to leave their neighbours in a condition of
        misery, which forces them to beg. This is proved by the words. occurring
        in the same chapter of Deuteronomy: “of your countrymen and neighbour
        you shall not have power to demand it again.” On these words, the Gloss
        observes: “Although all men be our neighbours, we are chiefly bound to
        show mercy to those who, together with ourselves, are the members of
        Christ.” Hence although charity is enjoined, mendicity is not forbidden.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The Gloss interprets the words, “ I have not seen tho,just man
        forsaken by God,” to mean: “I have not seen the seed of the just man
        perishing for want of spiritual food, i.e. the Word of God; for the Word
        of God is always with him.” But, if this text be understood to refer to
        material bread, it means that the just are not reduced to beggary by
        necessity, or because God has deserted them; since it is said: “I will
        not leave you nor forsake you” (Hebr. xvi. 5). The words do not mean
        that just men may not, for love of God, embrace poverty, although they
        did not do so in the days of the Psalmist. For such works of perfection
        were reserved for the time of Grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. It is not unfitting that what indicted on one man as a penalty may
        be, in another, a self-imposed work of justice. Criminals have their
        goods confiscated as a legal punishment; but this is no reason why other
        men may not despoil themselves of their possessions for the love of God.
        Again, beggary may fall upon sinners as a Divine chastisement; but this
        is no reason why mendicity, voluntarily embraced for Christ, should not
        be a work of justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The Gloss understands the text quoted in the fourth objection to mean
        that men are not to beg avariciously. Otherwise the commentary would not
        be in harmony with the text. The text says: “that you want nothing of
        any man’s.” Now they beg avariciously who seek, not merely necessary
        food and clothing, but who further desire to amass riches. This, as has
        been already pointed out, is made clear by the words in 1 Tim. vi.
        quoted above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. There are two kinds of mendicity, namely, voluntary and compulsory.
        Those reduced to beggary against their will, are liable to be tempted to
        impatience. Voluntary mendicity, which does not proceed from avarice,
        has the merit of humility. Hence St. Augustine does not forbid voluntary
        mendicity. He simply teaches that the occasion of compulsory beggary
        should be avoided by the poor of Christ by means of manual labour. This
        is evident by his words: “that they may not be compelled by need etc.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The sixth objection is quite irrelevant to the matter in hand. For
        the words of St. Jerome refer to the habit of asking for and accepting
        superfluities. This is evident by what he says in his letter to the
        priest Nepotian.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The law referred to, applies to sturdy beggars who were useless to
        the state and who, living idle lives, defrauded other poor people of
        their rights. The law in question speaks of them as slothful men. Of
        this class are gluttons who beg for food which they may eat in idleness.
        Religious cannot, except in malice, be held to belong to this class. It
        need not always be a heinous sin which is punished severely; for
        chastisement is inflicted not merely as a penalty for guilt, but also as
        a warning to the offender or to others. Hence at times a heavy penalty
        is awarded to an offence which, though not heinous in itself, is
        habitual. This is done in order that it may act as a deterrent to the
        criminal. The chapter quoted in the objection refers only to punishment
        inflicted to avenge sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Those of whom St. Augustine speaks begged not merely for necessities,
        but for superfluities. Their holiness, therefore, was not true, but
        hypocritical. This is made clear by the fact that he speaks of their
        “desiring luxurious poverty,” or “the recompense of feigned sanctity.”
        In thus acting they were, of course, reprehensible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Shame results from a base action: baseness is opposed to beauty.
        Hence baseness, and the shame consequent upon it, must be distinguished
        according to the kind of beauty to which it is opposed. Beauty may be
        either spiritual or physical. Spiritual beauty consists in a well
        ordered soul, and in abundance of spiritual gifts. Hence all that arises
        from a deficiency of spiritual good, or which points to spiritual
        disorder, is base. Physical beauty consists in symmetry of body and in
        the due proportion of such things as pertain to corporeal perfection.
        Bodily deformity or deficiency is, in a certain sense, base. And as both
        spiritual and physical beauty are loved and desired, spiritual and
        physical deformity cause a certain shame. Thus, a man is ashamed of
        being poor or unsightly or ignorant or awkward. Since spiritual
        deformity is always reprehensible, all that produces the shame of such
        deformity ought to be avoided. We speak not of the confession of sins,
        for the shiner is ashamed, not of his confession, but of the guilt which
        he acknowledges. But holy men think little of physical defect or
        deformity. In fact, they embrace it willingly for the love of Christ and
        for the sake of perfection. Hence the ignominy that accompanies such
        physical deformity is not always an object of contempt. Sometimes,
        indeed, it is worthy of high praise, as when it is assumed for the sake
        of humility. Now beggary is shameful, inasmuch as it is a disgrace
        attached to a material deficiency. For a beggar acknowledges that he is
        poor and is often subject to the one to whom he appeals for the relief
        of his needs. But beggary undertaken for the sake of Christ deserves
        honour rather than contempt.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. A man who is asked for charity ought not to be wearied, if the
        petition is properly made. And if he is wearied, the fault lies in him
        for giving alms in order to free himself from importunity, rather than
        with him who asks in a becoming manner, for the relief of his needs.
        But, if the petition is not rightly made, the fault lies with the
        petitioner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We shall next undertake to answer, in their proper order, the arguments
        of those who hold that religious who preach may not live on charity, or
        beg for alms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. It by no means follows that because preachers live on alms, they must
        necessarily be flatterers. When they preach without flattery, they often
        find but small favour among wicked and carnal-minded men, although they
        are approved of by the good; in face, sometimes they have to suffer at
        the hands of those whose favour they could not win without adulation. At
        other times they are well received by good men who do not wish to be
        flattered. They thus resemble Lord who, at times, had no roof to shelter
        Him, and at other times was entertained by many and who received the
        ministry of women who followed Him, as we read in Luke (viii.). Thus
        likewise the Apostles sometimes endured great distress; and at other
        times they were well supplied, behaving with discretion under both
        circumstances. “I know,” says St. Paul (Phil. iv. 12), “ how to abound
        and how to suffer want.” Vicissitudes of this description are the common
        experience of poor preachers in our own days.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Preachers, by asking for charity, do nothing that can be an occasion
        of avarice. Avarice is an inordinate love of possessing. It is not
        inordinate to wish to have necessary food and clothing. “Having what to
        eat, and wherewith to be clothed, with these we are content” (1 Tim. vi.
        8). Hence poor men are not, by begging for the necessities of life,
        exposed to any danger of avarice.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Prewhers ought not to desire material assistance as their primary end
        or object. They may, however ask for such temporal goods as a secondary
        end, or as the means whereby they may be enabled to achieve their
        primary end, which is the preaching of the Gospel. Commenting on the
        words, “Seek first the Kingdom of God and His justice” (Matt. vi. 36),
        the Gloss says: “By these words, our Lord shows us that we are not to
        desire temporal things as our chief and most necessary good. We are to
        seek the Kingdom of Heaven, and to set it before us as our end, and do
        all things for the attainment of that end. Let us then eat in order to
        preach, but not preach in order to eat.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The stipend which preachers receive is due to them for their work.
        They have a twofold right to the alms which they accept. A debt may be
        due by a double right. Some have a right to payment as a debt of legal
        justice due to them. Such a debt is the one resulting from the compact
        made between a workman and his employer, whereby the labourer can sue
        his employer for his wages. Others can likewise claim a reward as a debt
        of friendly justice. For when one man does a service to another, it is
        only fair that the other should make the best return within his power,
        although his friend cannot legally compel him to make any return.
        Aristotle speaks of this twofold sort of justice in <i>VIII Ethics</i>.
        I maintain, therefore, that when a prelate is set over the people, they
        have a right to demand spiritual ministrations from him; and he has a
        right to claim material assistance from them. But the people cannot
        claim spiritual service from any save prelates. Neither on the other
        hand, even though they preach by the permission of prelates, can any of
        the clergy who are not prelates, claim material assistance from the
        laity. They can only do so if they are appointed to be, in all things,
        the vicars of prelates. Hence we see that the poor who render no service
        whatsoever stand on a different footing in the matter of accepting alms,
        to religious who preach by permission of prelates, and are not
        themselves prelates, and to prelates themselves. For the poor accept
        everything gratis; and thus are mere mendicants. But preachers who are
        not prelates accept charity as a recompense due to them, although they
        cannot enforce its payment. Bishops, however, have compulsory power and
        can exact payment as a right. Nevertheless, if he who has the right to
        demand something does not assert this right, but begs for what he needs
        as if it were a free gift, he does no harm to anyone; but by his example
        he shows the beauty of humility.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The fifth objection is answered by saying that St. Paul wished to show
        that he had as good a right as the other Apostles to receive the
        donations of the faithful. And in order to make good this point, he
        began by proving that he was an Apostle just like the other Apostles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The false apostles were unjust usurpers when they accepted the
        contributions of the faithful. Three reasons prove this. First, they
        taught a doctrine that was false and contrary to the Gospel. For, as the
        Gloss observes, on the words “we likewise beseech you, brethren” (Rom.
        xvi.), “ they forced believers to follow Jewish rites.” Secondly, they
        preached without any commission from the true Apostles. Therefore St.
        Paul says that they “came in privately.” Thirdly, they behaved as if
        they possessed the authority of Apostles. Now as the objection ignores
        these three points, the reasoning contained in it is worthless.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        17. Preaching religious beg for what is, according to the second mode of
        justice, due to them; for a debt is a matter of justice. But they are
        the more to be commended, in as much as they ask for that which is their
        due as though it were a free gift.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Prelates who receive tithes and offerings from their people, and who
        duly minister to them, may elect certain coadjutors to assist them more
        efficiently in so doing. Such conduct is not unfair to the faithful. For
        if the laity give more temporal alms than is agreed upon, they receive,
        in return, more spiritual assistance than the prelates are obliged to
        give. Furthermore, their alms are not taken as a right, but are accepted
        thankfully and humbly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Everyone may renounce what is owing to him. Thus, although bishops
        are bound to support those whom they send to preach, the preachers may
        renounce their claim to such support. They do not, for this reason,
        become a burden on the people to whom they are sent. For they ask
        nothing from them but necessary food; and this they do not claim as a
        right but beg for as alms, according as each one of their hearers may
        have determined in his heart. They thus imitate the example of St. Paul
        (2 Cor. viii-ix).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Hypocrites were rebuked by our Lord for seeking gain by means of
        prayer and of superstitious practices. The Gloss says: “Woe to you
        Scribes and Pharisees, for by your superstitions you aim at nothing save
        at despoiling those who listen to you.” But it is rash to pass this
        judgment on anyone, for his private motive is the secret of each man’s
        own heart.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Preachers have no right to consort with persons of bad character, if
        there is danger that the vices of such persons may be attributed to them
        also, and if their preaching may, for this reason, fall into discredit.
        St. Gregory says: “If a man’s conduct is despised, his preaching will be
        contemned.” The Gloss speaks in like manner. If, however, preachers,
        without losing their own reputation, make friends with men of bad
        character in order to reform them, it is a praiseworthy act. It is done
        in imitation of our Lord. For we read in Matt. ix. 11, “The scribes and
        Pharisees said to his disciples: why does your Master eat with publicans
        and sinners? “The Gloss observes that Christ, by so doing, “gave His
        disciples an example of mercy.” But if sinners do not esteem it a favour
        that the preachers of the Gospel should consort with them, the fault
        lies with them, not with the preachers,
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. If those who preach the Word accept from their hearers the
        necessities of life, they do not sell the Gospel. For, as we have
        already said, material gain is not their primary motive in preaching.
        The Gloss, on the words: “let the priests that rule well” (1 Tim. v.),
        remarks: “Good and faithful dispensers of the Word ought not to attain
        heavenly glory only, but likewise earthly honour that so they may not
        have cause for sadness.” Again, “Alms are given from charity, and
        accepted through necessity. Nevertheless the Gospel is not venal. It is
        not preached in exchange for earthly goods. They who proclaim it do so
        for the sake of eternal happiness. For, were they to sell so great a
        treasure, they would show that they held it in contempt. Let preachers
        then, accept from the people as a necessity the means of existence, and
        let them receive from the Lord the reward of their labours. For they do
        not regard the alms of the faithful as a recompense or a motive for
        their work. Their ministry is one of love. They accept what is given
        them as a stipend whereby they may procure the supplies which are
        necessary to enable them to continue their labours.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. Although there might have been some appearance of evil in the
        conduct of the Apostles if they had taken alms from the Gentiles to whom
        they preached the Faith, and if they had thereby introduced a new
        custom, it cannot now be considered disedifying if preachers accept alms
        from the faithful. For this custom is sanctioned by the Gospel; and
        those to whom charity is given need it not for superfluities, but for
        the necessities of life. It is evident also that religious do not preach
        for the sake of gain; for the alms that they receive are far inferior in
        amount to the worldly possessions which they renounced for the love of
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We will next reply, one by one, to the arguments brought to show that
        alms ought not to be given to religious:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The words “call the poor, from whom you have at present nothing to
        expect,” mean only that in giving alms the intention of receiving a
        reward must not be present to the mind, though they may receive it in
        the future. For there is no one so poor that he may not, in some case of
        emergency, be of use to us. This is made clear by the following words of
        the Gloss: “If you invite others in order to be invited yourself, you
        may deceive yourself.” Neither are we to understand that there will be
        no eternal reward for those who call together rich men or their own
        kinsfolk, for such an invitation may proceed from charity, and may be
        given for the love of God. Hence the Gloss says: “Those who invite the
        poor expect a future recompense; those who call together their friends
        and brethren, or wealthy people, have their reward now. But if, like the
        sons of Job, they entertain rich persons for the love of God, then He
        who commands us to practise brotherly love will reward such hospitality
        equally with other works of charity.” But we are not to conclude that it
        is a sin to entertain our kinsfolk, even from mere natural affection,
        but only that such hospitality does not deserve an everlasting
        recompense. The Gloss remarks: “Our Lord does not forbid us to call
        together our wealthy friends, and our kinsmen, as if it were criminal to
        do so. He only tells us that such an invitation, will not be rewarded
        with eternal life.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The saying of St. Augustine, adduced in the second, objection, is to
        be understood in the same sense as that of Sirach (xii. 4), “Give to the
        merciful, and uphold not the sinners.” The Gloss observes on this text:
        “Do not encourage sinners in their sinful ways; do not hold
        communication with them, as they do who entertain actors, and suffer the
        poor of Christ to hunger.” But he who gives to a sinner who is in want,
        not in order to encourage him to sin, but because he recognises him as a
        man, assists not a sinner but a just man, because he loves not the
        sinner but human nature. It is better, however, to withhold an alms,
        than to give it to a man because he is a sinner, or in order to cause
        him to sin. But it does not follow that we may not bestow charity on the
        poor of Christ who do no manual work. For, as we have already shown,
        they commit no sin by omitting to perform such labour. And even were
        their omission criminal, we would not be assisting them because they are
        sinners, but because they are in distress.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. He who asks in an unbecoming manner should not obtain what he
        demands; he should rather bo corrected. But he who begs befittingly
        should, if possible, receive what he asks for. Hence St. Gregory,
        <i>XXL Moral.</i>, says on the words of Job: “ If I have denied to the
        poor what they desired,” that “the holy man, in this saying, bears
        testimony to himself that he not only assisted the poor in their needs,
        but condescended to their desires. But what is to be done when the poor
        ask for things that are not expedient for them to have? Or, since in
        Holy Scripture, the poor are spoken of as being humble, are we to
        consider that they ought to have only those things for which they ask
        with humility? It is certain that we ought to give them those things
        that they beg humbly for, <i>i.e.</i> that they ask for out of
        necessity, not out of covetousness. For it would be great pride if they
        were to beg for what is unsuited to their condition of poverty.” We
        should, therefore, unhesitatingly, assist the poor in their necessities,
        and we should. rebuke those who ask for superfluities.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. As it is said in the fourth objection, we must refuse alms when, by
        giving them, we would encourage the recipients to commit injustice; but
        we should not refuse such assistance in cases of extreme necessity. But
        as mendicant religious ask for alms not for criminal purposes, but for
        the furtherance of their sacred labours, this proposition does not apply
        to them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. St. Ambrose does not say, in the words referred to, that infirmity of
        health or the shame experienced by those who beg are to be considered as
        reasons for giving alms. We give alms on account of the need of those
        who ask for them. What St. Ambrose says is that we should give more
        abundantly to those who are sick and to those who are ashamed of
        begging. He does not say that we are not to give to those who are in
        good health, and to those who are not ashamed to beg; but that, other
        things being equal, the sick and retiring are especially deserving of
        our charity. But sickness and reluctance to beg are not the only
        conditions which should, excite our charity. We must also consider the
        reputation of the one who asks us, his claims upon us, his needs, etc.
        It is not only those who have lost their fortune by accident who feel
        ashamed to beg. Religious, who have voluntarily renounced all things for
        the love of God, experience the reluctance. For they often belong to
        noble families; and shame at begging is therefore natural to them. But
        in religious this natural shame, like other passions, is perhaps more
        fully subject to reason than is the case with laymen.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Although there may be many reasons for giving more abundant alms to
        one man than to another, we cannot conclude for any one reason that one
        man always deserves more assistance than others. Thus the fact that a
        man is in greater need than are others is not always a reason why he
        should be helped more than others. For a man in less distressed
        circumstances might be able to show cause why he should receive more
        assistance from us than a neighbour poorer than he. Aristotle teaches
        (<i>Ethics IX</i>) that the preponderating reason for relieving another
        is his claim upon us. For, except under very peculiar circumstances, we
        are more strictly bound to pay a debt than to give a favour. Now as we
        owe preachers the necessities of life as a stipend for their labours, we
        are bound in a special manner to bestow our alms upon them, especially
        when they are in distress. This is a debt of justice. This, therefore,
        we ought to pay, unless there are many grave reasons to prevent our so
        doing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. In reply to the seventh difficulty we must say that ‘there are two
        sorts of happiness, spiritual and material. There are likewise two kinds
        of misery, spiritual and material. Religious, who have made themselves
        voluntarily poor have not to suffer spiritual misery, which is absolute
        misery. Rather, our Lord calls them “blessed” (Matt. v.; Luke vi.). They
        are, however, subject to physical distress, and are therefore worthy
        objects of material relief.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Kinship is one reason for giving alms more abundantly in some cases
        than in others. It is not, however, the only standard whereby our
        charity is to be proportioned. Therefore, it does not follow, as we have
        already said, that we are always to give most assistance to those most
        nearly related to us.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        WE will now proceed to refute the malicious accusations brought against
        religious. These are inspired by the presumption of their enemies. We
        may, in this connection, aptly quote the words of St. Gregory (<i
          >V Moral.</i
        >), “No one would presume to correct the faults of the Saints, unless he
        entertained a better opinion of himself than of them.” St. Jerome
        likewise says to Sabinianus: “Lest you should find yourself solitary in
        evildoing, you pretend that the servants of God have also committed
        crimes. You do not know that you are speaking iniquity against another
        and are opening open your mouth against Heaven. It is no wonder that
        some servants of God are blasphemed by you, since your ancestors have
        called their father Beelzebub.” The calumniators of religious, being
        determined that nothing shall be wanting to fill the measure of their
        malice, pervert their judgment in a twofold manner. They pass unjust
        condemnation both on persons and on things. This double perversity of
        judgment is recognised by the Gloss in the commentary on the text,
        “Judge not before the time” (1 Cor. iv). On these words the Gloss says:
        “We must beware lest we be deceived by a false opinion. We cannot know
        the consciences of men, nor have true and certain knowledge of this
        affair; nor can we be sure whether such or such a man is moral or
        immoral, whether he is just or unjust. Let us ourselves abhor immorality
        and injustice and love justice and morality. We know, in the truth of
        God, that some things are to be desired and that others avoided. Let us
        then desire those things that we ought to desire, and avoid those things
        that we ought to avoid; in order that we may be forgiven if, at times or
        even often, we do not pass a true judgment upon men.” But as, according
        to the Gloss, it is worse to entertain a false opinion about things than
        about men, let us attack the greater evil in the first place, and
        consider how the enemies of religious pervert their judgment as to
        facts. We will then consider their false opinions about persons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The assailants of religious pervert their judgment about facts in two
        ways. They first of all declare that the good manifestly wrought by
        religious is evil. Thus they fulfil the words of Sirach (xi. 33), “he
        lies in wait, and turns good into evil; and on the elect he will lay a
        blot.” Then they pretend that the indifferent actions of religious are
        wrong. Now by condemning the good works of religious as evil, they pass
        judgment on themselves, and they prove that those whom they blame are
        highly to be commended. They condemn religious because their virtuous
        lives are offensive to them. St. Gregory, speaking of men of this
        description, says (<i>VI Moral.</i>), “The wicked man detracts from the
        reputation of the just, and he never ceases to condemn and to blame the
        good actions which he himself neglects to perform.” Detractors of
        religious, by blaming them, give the best proof of their innocence. They
        imitate the princes of Daniel, who said in their malice against that
        prophet, “We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, unless
        perhaps concerning the law of his God.” On these words, the Gloss
        observes: “O spotless life, wherein his enemies could detect no guilt,
        save in the law which he observes.” Now the only ground of detraction
        which they can find against religious, and the only reason for holding
        them up to contempt, is the law of God to which they are faithful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. They blame them on account of the poor habit which they wear.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. They condemn them for their charity to others and for compassionately
        assisting their neighbours in the management of their affairs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. They complain that religious, who have here no abiding city, wander
        from city to city to preach the Word of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. They find fault with them for studying.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. They blame them for preaching in a systematic and fluent style.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now by thus condemning religious, their assailants show that they
        despise their poverty, their mendicancy, and their teaching, and that
        they are opposed to the good fruit which, by episcopal permission, they
        are enabled to produce in souls.

          Are Assailed</span

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        They bring up many arguments against the religious custom of wearing a
        poor habit:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. They quote the words of our Lord, “Beware of false prophets who come
        to you in the clothing of sheep” etc. (Matt. vii, 15). This warning they
        apply to those who wear poor clothing; and, Hence they seek to Prove
        that religious ought to be suspected of being fibe prophets.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The Gloss, on the words “Behold a pale horse (Rev. vi.), comments as
        follows: “The devil, finding that he cannot further his schemes against
        the Church either by persecution or by open heresy, sends forth false
        brethren who, under the disguise of the religious habit, possess the
        nature of roan and black horses and pervert the faith.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. It is said again that in the early days of the Church an order was
        sent from Rome to the Bishops of Gaul, commanding them to rebuke those
        who, under a pretext of humility, chose to wear contemptible garments
        unlike the ordinary dress of the time. This decree is said to be
        preserved in the register of the Roman Church, although there are no
        traces of it in the body of the decretals. This alleged Papal command is
        held to be a proof that men, at least those who live in the world, are
        not justified in wearing garments unfitted to their station.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. St. Augustine says (<i>III De doctrina Christiana</i>), “Whoever
        makes a more limited use of temporal things than is customary with those
        among whom he lives, is guilty either of superstition or of
        indiscretion.” Hence he who wears clothing, meaner than that worn by
        those around him, is deserving of blame.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. St. Jerome, writing to Nepotianus, says: “Wear neither sad-coloured,
        nor white garments. Sumptuous apparel and slovenly dress are equally to
        be avoided. For the one denotes luxury, and the other vain glory.” Hence
        we see the error of dressing in a beggarly fashion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. St. Paul says (Rom. xiv. 17), “The Kingdom of God is not meat and
        drink.” On these words, the Gloss observes: “It matters little of what
        quality our food may be, or what quantity we may consume, so long as our
        nourishment is adapted to the condition of those with whom we live and
        of our own, and to the requirements of our health.” For the same reason,
        the fashion of a man’s clothing has no connection with virtue, provided
        that he wear what is becoming to his condition. Hence it is no mark of a
        truly religious man to wear a mean dress as a sign of contempt of the
        world.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Hypocrisy would seem to be the worst of all sins. For, our Lord
        inveighed more forcibly against hypocrites than against any other class
        of sinner. St. Gregory says (<i>Pastoral.</i>), “ None do more harm in
        the Church than sinners who have a reputation for, or appearance of,
        sanctity.” Hypocrisy lurks under shabby clothing, just as costliness of
        attire betokens luxury or stimulates men to pride. It is more sinful,
        therefore, to exceed the limits of discretion by poverty of attire than
        by gaudiness of apparel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Our Lord Jesus Christ gave us an example of the perfection of
        holiness and of religion. But, he wore a precious garment, namely, a
        coat woven throughout (John xix. 23). Such clothes are normally sewn
        with silk and gold. The fact that the soldiers would not divide it, but
        cast lots for it, is a proof that it must have been costly. Hence
        wearing mean clothing can be no part of religion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. The Sovereign Pontiff wears costly silken robes; the kings of old
        were clad in scarlet; and it would not have been praiseworthy in them
        had they worn contemptible garments. For the same reason, it is not
        meritorious on the part of anyone, to wear garments unbecoming his
        station; rather, the shabbiness of his clothing brings humility into
        disrepute.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We will now expose the fallacy contained in the foregoing arguments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. We read (<i>XXI, quaest. IX</i>), “All extravagance or ornateness of
        attire is unbecoming Holy Orders. Therefore, it behoves all bishops or
        ecclesiastics who attire themselves in costly or showy garments to
        amend; for if they persist in so doing, a penalty will be laid upon
        them.” It is added later on, “And if any should be, found to ridicule
        those who wear poor and religious garments, let him do penance.” In the
        early ages of the Church, every man consecrated to God wore coarse and
        common clothing. For, as St. Basil says, all that is worn not out of
        necessity but for the sake of adornment is accounted as pride. Hence
        plainness of attire is to be encouraged; all ostentation is to be
        avoided; and they who speak ill of men who wear poor garments are to be
        severely punished.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. We are confirmed in this by the example of St. John, who wore a
        garment made of camel’s hair (Matt. ii). The Gloss, hereon, observes,
        that “he who preached penance, wore a garment of penance, and that such
        poverty of apparel was as praiseworthy in him, as it would have been
        unseemly in a wealthy man. Another commentary says that, “a servant of
        God ought to use clothing not for pleasure or adornment, but for the
        purpose of necessary covering.” The Gloss also observes, on St. Mark. i,
        that the Baptist’s garment of camel’s hair was the raiment befitting
        preachers. Hence we learn that the servants of God, especially such as
        preach penance, ought to wear the garb of humility.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. We are told once more (Heb. xi.) that the prophets of old, such as
        Elijah and others, wandered about in sheep’s skins, in goat skins.” The
        word <i>melota</i> is used indiscriminately for undressed sheep skin, or
        goat skin, and it signifies consequently a very rough and harsh covering
        for the body. The Gloss says that the same word is used for camel’s
        hair.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. We are told of Sts. Hilarion, Arsenius, and of other Fathers of the
        desert, that they wore the very coarsest clothing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. We read the following words in Revelation (xi. 3): “I will give to my
        two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred sixty
        days, clothed in sackcloth.” This, the Gloss interprets to mean: “They
        shall preach penance both by word and example.” Another commentary
        remarks on the same text, “You ought, in preaching, to follow their
        example.” From this we must understand that they who preach penance
        ought to wear a penitential garment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. St. Gregory, in his homily on the text, “There was a certain rich
        man,” strongly inculcates the lesson, that poverty of clothing is as
        much to be commended, as extravagance of apparel is to be condemned. We
        quote his words: “Some men consider, that there is no sin in excessive
        daintiness and magnificence of attire. But, if such were the case, the
        Word of God would not expressly tell us that the rich man who was
        tormented in hell had worn purple and fine linen. No one dresses in an
        ostentatious manner save for the sake of vainglory, and in order to
        outdo others in splendour. For the very fact that a man does not deck
        himself out when there is none to see him, proves that he wears his fine
        garments from motives of vainglory. We shall see more clearly the fault
        committed by extravagance of dress, if we compare it with the virtue of
        humility displayed in mean apparel. For, were it not a virtue to wear
        contemptible garments, the Evangelist would not have expressly told us
        that the clothing of St. John the Baptist was of camel’s hair.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. On the words of St. Peter (1 Pet. iii. 3), “Whose adorning let it not
        be outward plaiting of the hair” etc., the Gloss makes the following
        commentary: “As St. Cyprian says, they who are clad in silk and scarlet
        cannot put on Christ. They who are adorned with gold and pearls, and
        suchlike gauds, have lost the ornament of heart and of body. If the
        women whom St. Peter admonishes in the text we have quoted were married
        women, who might have alleged their husbands as an excuse for their
        vanity in dress, how much more ought virgins, who have no such excuse,
        to take to heart the warning of the Apostle? “It is clear therefore that
        in ecclesiastics, sumptuousness of apparel is far more to be deprecated
        than it is in women.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. An outward act which reveals the virtue of the heart is, even though
        liable to abuse, very commendable. Poverty of clothing comes into this
        category. Thus, St. Jerome, writing to the monk Rustieus, says: “A lowly
        garb betokens a noble mind. A coarse tunic denotes contempt of the
        world, provided that the soul of one thus clad is not puffed up with
        pride, and that his words are not inconsistent with his garment.” Hence
        the habit of wearing coarse clothes is, in itself, one to be adopted, if
        at the same time pride is banished from the heart.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. That which wins the Divine mercy, cannot be wrong. Now many, even
        great, sinners have, by assuming a garb of penance, gained the mercy of
        heaven. We are told of the impious Ahab (1 Kings xxi. 27) that “when he,
        had heard these words (<i>i.e.</i> of Elijah) he rent his garments and
        put haircloth upon his flesh and fasted and slept in sackcloth. And the
        word of the Lord came to Elijah the Thesbite, saying: Have you not seen
        Ahab humbled before me? Therefore, because he has humbled himself for my
        sake, I will not bring the evil in his days.” Nevertheless, the humility
        of Ahab was not, as the Gloss says, true humility of heart. Again, in
        the third chapter of the book of Jonah we read: “The word came to the
        king of Niniveh, and he rose up out of his throne and cast away his robe
        from him and put on sackcloth and sat in ashes.” He also ordered all his
        subjects to do likewise. Hence we see that humility of clothing is
        acceptable to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Aristotle (<i>X Ethic.</i>) proves that “virtue consists not only in
        interior, but likewise in exterior acts. He is here speaking of the
        moral virtues. Now humility is, in a certain sense, a moral virtue; for
        it belongs neither to the intellectual nor to the theological virtues.
        Hence it consists not merely in interior but likewise in exterior acts.
        As self-contempt pertains to humility, it follows that it is consistent
        with humility for a man to render himself exteriorly contemptible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Evil is never disguised, save under an appearance of good. Now
        hypocrites cloak their malice under a guise of humility. Hence a humble
        garb has in itself an appearance of good, and therefore in itself it is
        commendable, although it is liable to abuse.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. As fasting and almsdeeds are praiseworthy exercises of penance, so
        the habit of wearing a contemptible dress is likewise a commendable
        custom, although some may make a bad use of it. From all that we have
        said, while admitting the possibility of its abuse, we maintain that in
        itself the wearing of a humble dress is praiseworthy, as being an act of
        penitence and humility practised by some who, by their station in life,
        have a right to costly clothing; just as many have the laudable habit of
        fasting and abstaining who might, according to their condition, make use
        of flesh meat. But both fasting and wearing a contemptible clothing may,
        for some exceptional reason, be evil, if for instance it is practised in
        a manner annoying to those with whom we live, or if it is done from
        motives of vainglory. The same remark applies to prayer and to
        almsdeeds, as our Lord himself teaches (Matt. vi).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We will now reply to the other objections, alleged against the religious
        habit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The fact that false prophets make use of sheep’s clothing to deceive
        the faithful is rather in favour of the habit of wearing poor clothing
        than against it. For hypocrites would not thus disguise their malice,
        unless a contemptible garb carried with it an appearance of good.
        Otherwise the Scriptures which, as we are told (2 Pet. iii.), that
        heretics abuse, ought to be reprobated. The same might be said of piety,
        which heretics often pretend (2 Tim. iii.). Hence the Gloss says, on St.
        Matt. vii, that false prophets are recognised not by their garments, but
        by their works. Again, the Gloss adds that sheep should not lay aside
        their clothing, even though, at times wolves may assume it as a
        disguise.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The devil would not clothe his emissaries in a religious habit if
        this habit were not, in itself a token of goodness. But this is no
        reason why virtuous persons should not wear the religious habit; nor is
        it a reason why all who wear it should be accounted wicked (Gloss on
        Matt, vii). Hence St. Jerome asks in his book against Helvidius, “Does
        the fact that it is sinful to pretend to be a virgin, make virginity
        itself a crime?”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The prohibition, quoted in this objection was not published because
        poverty of clothing is in itself reprehensible, but because it is
        assumed by some men or the purposes of deception.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The quotation of St. Augustine, cited in this objection, applies,
        only, to such rigour of life as causes dissension amongst those with
        whom we have to live. For, if it be understood absolutely, everyone who
        fasts when others do not fast would deserve blame. This idea is, of
        course, absurd.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The words here quoted from St. Jerome apply not to the use, but to
        the abuse, of a poor and lowly garb. He utters a warning against the
        vainglory which may arise from such a custom. In his epistles to the
        monk Rusticus, and to the nobleman Pammachius, he commends poverty and
        humility of clothing. This is evident from his epistle to Pammachius on
        the death of Paulina.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The use of exterior things may be regarded from a double point of
        view. Their use is indifferent if we consider the nature of the things
        themselves. If, however, we regard the end for which we use them, their
        use is commendable in proportion to the excellence of that end. For
        example, fasting practised as a means of overcoming lust is more
        commendable than the eating of ordinary food with giving of thanks.
        Jovinian denied this proposition; but he was refuted in this and in his
        other errors by St. Jerome. Hence poverty of clothing, when it is
        intended as humiliation for the soul and as a conquest over the body, is
        in itself more to be commended than ordinary clothing. Consequently, as
        religion is evidenced by fasting, so, on the same grounds, is it seen in
        humility of attire.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The fact that the assumption of poor garments for hypocritical
        purposes is a great sin does not prove that poverty of apparel is itself
        more sinful than extravagance of attire. For poverty of clothing is not
        as closely connected with hypocrisy as splendour of attire is related to
        pride and luxury. Ostentation in dress leads of itself and directly to
        pride and luxury. It is therefore in itself culpable. But meanness of
        attire does not of itself directly tend to hypocrisy. Hypocrisy results
        from the abuse of a humble fashion of dress, just as it may result from
        the abuse of any other good work. Now the more excellent a work is, the
        more reprehensible is its abuse. Therefore the heinousness of hypocrisy
        is a testimony in favour of poverty of apparel and of the other external
        penitential works of which hypocrisy is the abuse. We do not mean,
        however, that hypocrisy is absolutely speaking the greatest of sins. For
        unbelief, whereby a man lies against God, is a more heinous crime than
        dissimulation, whereby he lies against himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. It is not credible that our Lord Jesus Christ should have been clad
        in costly clothing. For He commended St. John in that he was not clothed
        soft garments. The Pharisees laid great stress on exterior sanctity.
        They accused Christ Himself of being a glutton, a wine bibber, and a
        friend of publicans; so would they have accused the Baptist had he worn
        soft garments. Thesoldiers who mocked our Lord would not have clothed
        Him in a purple garment as a mark of sovereignty, if His own tunic had
        been woven with silk and gold. The soldiers who cast lots for His
        seamless coat did so, not because it was of costly material, but for the
        sake of their own profit. For, had it been divided, it would have been
        of no use to any of them. This alone suffices to prove that His garment
        was not valuable. Had it been of rich material, they would have divided
        it. But, as the Gloss says, our Lord’s seamless coat was a figure of the
        unity of the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Certain stations in life have a dress proper to them, just as each
        religious order has its own habit. The robes of the kings of old, and of
        the Sovereign Pontiff at the present time must be considered as the
        insignia of their office. And, just as a religious has no right to wear
        a meaner habit than the one belonging to his order, (though it is
        praiseworthy in him to wear the poorest allowed by the statutes of his
        rule), so neither would it have been lawful for monarchs of former days,
        nor for the Sovereign Pontiff in these times, to wear apparel unbecoming
        their dignity. But the case is different with regard to princes and
        other men, who have no fixed robes of state. It is not reprehensible in
        them if they wear the poorest garments compatible with their station.
        Michal cried out in mockery of David, (2 Sam. vi. 20), “How glorious was
        the King of Israel today, uncovering himself before the handmaids of his
        servants, and he was naked as if one of the buffoons should be naked.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And David answered: I will both play, and will make myself meaner than I
        have done; and I will be little in my own eyes.” Again, Esther, speaking
        to the Almighty, said (Esther xiv. 16), “You know my necessity that I
        abominate the sign of my pride and glory which is upon my head in the
        days of my public appearance; and I do not wear it in the days of my
        silence.” Hence we see that it is praiseworthy, even in kings and
        princes if, when they can do so without scandal or without detriment to
        their authority, they are content with humble apparel.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. St. Paul says, “We have heard that there are some among you who walk
        disorderly, working not at all, but curiously meddling” (2 Thes. iii.
        11). On this passage the Gloss remarks, “Do men who act thus, contrary
        to the law of the Lord, deserve to be supported by the alms of others?”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. “No man being a soldier to God, entangles himself with secular
        business” (2 Tim. ii.) “of any kind whatsoever,” adds the Gloss. Now as
        the affairs of other people are frequently of a worldly nature, it is
        maintained that religious ought never to concern themselves with the
        business of their neighbours.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This opinion is directly opposed to the teaching of St. James, who says:
        “Now religion pure and undefiled, before God and the Father, is this: to
        visit the orphans and the widow in their tribulation” (Jam. i. 22), i.e.
        “to help those who are in distress and have no other assistance,” as the
        Gloss explains.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        “I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, that you assist her in whatever
        business she shall have need of you” (Ron. xvi. 1). The Gloss says that
        the Apostle here speaks of a woman who had gone to Rome on some
        business. He commends her to the care of the Romans. “Bear ye one
        another’s burdens, for so you shall fulfil the law of Christ,” St. Paul
        also writes to the Galatians (vi. 2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        These words, all prove that it is commendable in a man to be as anxious
        about his neighbour’s interests as if they were his own. Nevertheless,
        two faults are to be avoided in the exercise of this fraternal charity.
        We must beware of being so occupied about other people’s affairs as to
        neglect our own. St. Paul warns us against this error, saying,
        “Endeavour to be quiet,” i.e. free from curiosity (Gloss), and “do your
        own business,” (1 Thes. iv.), “leaving other people’s alone” (Gloss). We
        are here commanded to mind our own concerns, rather than those of our
        neighbours. St. Paul also warns us (2 Thess. iii.) against helping
        others in any illicit proceedings, or assisting them from an unlawful
        motive. Hence the Gloss says on the words “curiously meddling”: Do men
        who thus act contrary to the law of the Lord deserve to be supported by
        the alms of others? For their God is their belly, and with unworthy
        solicitude they seek to provide themselves with the necessities of
        life.” Their iniquitous motive is proved by the fact that they desire
        only their own material advantage. That they seek, with reprehensible
        anxiety, to procure such advantage proves that they are engaged in some
        unlawful business. This is our answer to the two first accusations
        brought against religious who assist their neighbour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the third charge we answer that according to the explanation of the
        Gloss, those occupations are to be called secular, in which men are
        engaged in making money, but not by manual labour. To this class belong
        all mercantile pursuits. Religious are forbidden to involve themselves
        in any business of this description. They may not, for instance, trade
        in another man’s interest. There is no reason, however, against their
        performing charitable offices for their neighbours, such as giving him
        advice, or interceding for him.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        WE will in this chapter, consider the charges brought against religious
        on account of their journeying.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. St. Paul says (2 Thess. iii. 11), “We have heard that there are some
        among you that walk disorderly.” On account of this text, religious who
        travel, are called by their enemies wanderers (<i>gyrovagi</i>).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The following words of St. Augustine are likewise, quoted against
        them, “Some monks,” he says, “bear no commission; yet they are never
        quiet, never settled, never at rest” (<i>De opere Monachorum</i>).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. On the words, “Whichever house you enter, there abide” (Mark vi. 10),
        the Gloss says: “It is not becoming in a preacher, to run from house to
        house and to change the place wherein he enjoys hospitality.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The following words of Isaiah, (xxx. 7), are quoted in the same
        sense: “Therefore, have I cried concerning this: It is pride; only sit
        still [Vulgate],” <i>i.e.</i>, “abide in your own land “ (Gloss).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Again, we read in the Prophet Jeremias (xiv. 10): These people have
        loved to move their feet, they have not rested and have not pleased the
        Lord.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This accusation of restlessness, brought against preachers, is nothing
        new. For Dionysius, in his letter to Apolophanius, says that when he was
        still a Gentile, he used to call St. Paul a wanderer round the world,
        because he obeyed the command of our Lord. “Go therefore into the whole
        world and preach the Gospel to every creature” (Mark xvi. 15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. In the Gospel of St. John (xv. 16), we, also, read that Christ said
        to His disciples: “I have chosen you that you should go, and should
        bring forth fruit.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The journeyings of preachers are symbolised by the words in Job,
        (xxxvii, 11), “ The clouds spread their light; they go round about,
        whithersoever the Will of Him who governs them leads them, to whatever
        he commands them on the face of the whole earth.” The Gloss hereon
        observes: “The clouds that spread their light typify holy preachers who
        by word and deed propagate the example of a good life and who illuminate
        all around them, because by their preaching they enlighten the ends of
        the earth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Again the words in Job (xxxviii. 25), “Who gave a course to violent
        showers?” is interpreted, by the Gloss and by St. Gregory
        (<i>Moral.</i>) of the journeys of preachers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. We read (Zech. vi, 7), “The strong horse came out, eager to patrol
        the earth.” The Gloss again understands these words to refer to the
        Apostles and to other preachers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. St. Paul says (Rom. xvi.), “Salute those who are of Narcissus’
        household.” The Gloss remarks that this Narcissus is said, in other
        codices, to have been a priest who journeyed about in order to confirm
        the brethren in the faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. “When they shall rush in to Jacob” (i.e., “ to preach,” says the
        Gloss), “they shall fill the face of the world with seed” (Isa. xxvii.
        6), <i>i.e.</i> the seed of preaching” (Gloss).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. In the Book of Proverbs (vi. 3) we find the words: “Run about, make
        haste, stir up your friend” (<i>i.e.</i> “from the sleep of sin,”
        Gloss). Now sinners are awakened by preaching. Therefore, journeys
        undertaken by preachers for the salvation of souls are praiseworthy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. “This was the vision running to and fro in the midst of the living
        creatures” (Ezek. i. 13). St. Gregory writes (<i
          >homil. V, I part super Ezech.</i
        >): “Pastors of souls, who have undertaken the duty of feeding their
        flock, ought but rarely to change their place of abode. But, they who
        journey abroad to preach are as wheels of fire, which move from place to
        place by the force of the flame of that holy desire which both consumes
        the preacher and inflames his hearers.” This passage teaches us two
        lessons, viz. that it is permissible for others, besides prelates, to
        preach; and that preachers ought to move from place to place, instead of
        remaining always in one spot.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. St. Gregory, in the same homily, commenting on the words of Ezek. i.,
        “When they walked, it was like the voice of a multitude, like the noise
        of an army,” says, “The camps of preachers move from one place to
        another, labouring for the salvation of souls.” We see, therefore, from
        all the passages that have been cited that the journeys undertaken by
        preachers in their zeal for souls are highly to be commended.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, we must note that the Holy Scripture blames three classes of men
        who wander about. The first class consists of those whose restless and
        changeable class disposition causes them to roam hither and thither, and
        whose journeys produce no fruit. The second class is composed of those
        who travel about in hopes of material profit. The third class is formed
        of those whose journeys are undertaken from some evil motive, and to
        accomplish some sinful end. Of all these three orders of men, St. Jude
        writes: “Woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain, and after
        the error of Balaam, they have for reward poured out themselves. These
        are spots in their banquets, feasting together without fear, feeding
        themselves, clouds without water which are carried about by winds, trees
        of the autumn, unfruitful” (<i>Epist. i. 11</i>). By these words is
        typified the unfruitfulness of journeys which are undertaken through
        frivolous motives. The Apostle blames the men of whom we have been
        speaking for the levity, or inordinate desires, which cause them to
        travel abroad. The Gloss says that the words of St. Jude refer to those
        who seek food by unworthy means or inquisitive disquiet.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. St. Augustine, when he speaks of monks, who, although they bear no
        commission, are never settled, never quiet, means that their journeys
        are undertaken from frivolous or avaricious motives. This is clear by
        the context, wherein he blames them for running about,in quest of lucre.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The words quoted from St. Mark vi and Luke x. plainly allude to men
        whose inordinate desires induce them to run from house to house in hopes
        of being supplied more abundantly with food by one family than by
        another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The text of Isaiah (xxx.) warns us against that inconstancy of mind,
        which tempts the man whose soul does not rest in God, to flit from one
        object to another, finding rest in none. The words, in their literal
        sense, refer to the Jews who, not satisfied with the Divine assistance
        accorded to them, desired to go down into Egypt to seek protection from
        the Egyptians. The words quoted from Jeremias are likewise a warning
        against that love of wandering about which arises from lightness of
        mind. This appears by the context, “These people have loved to move
        their feet.” For, they who move easily, delight in motion. And the
        Gloss, on this passage, explains the movement of the feet to mean
        movement of the affections.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        WE now proceed to consider the objections brought against the studious
        life led by religious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. We find (2 Tim. iii. 7) certain persons, who were a danger to the
        Church, accused of “ever learning and never attaining to the knowledge
        of the truth.” For this reason, it is considered a suspicious
        circumstance when religious are fond of study.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. St. Gregory makes the following remarks on the words of Job xvi., “My
        enemy has looked at me with terrible eyes”: “The Incarnate Truth,” he
        writes (<i>XIII Moral.</i>), “chose for His preachers such as were poor,
        simple, and unlearned. But, on the other hand, the astute and
        double-tongued man, filled with the knowledge of this world, whom at the
        end of time the Apostate Angel will elect to propagate his falsehood,
        will be damned.” Hence religious, because they exercise the office of
        preaching in a learned manner, are regarded as the forerunners of
        Antichrist.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. “I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns
        like a lamb” (Rev. xiii. 11). On these words of the Apocalypse the Gloss
        remarks: “The description of the tribulation which will be caused by
        Antichrist and his princes is followed by a narrative of the evils which
        will befall the Church, by means of the apostles of Antichrist, who will
        travel throughout the entire world.” Again, “coming up out of the earth”
        signifies “ going forth to preach” (Gloss). On the words “it had two
        horns” the Gloss remarks: “These preachers are said to have two horns,
        because they will profess to imitate the innocent and spotless life of
        our Lord, to work miracles resembling His, and to preach His doctrine;
        or else because they will usurp to themselves the two Testaments.” Hence
        it would appear that they who go forth to preach, with the knowledge of
        the two Testaments, and with an appearance of sanctity, are the apostles
        of Antichrist.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. “Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies (1 Cor. viii. 1). Now as
        religious are in a peculiar manner bound to the practice of humility,
        they ought to abstain from knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Of St. Benedict, patriarch of religious, we are told that “he
        withdrew from the study of literature, and that his learning was
        unlearned and his wisdom untaught” (St. Greg, <i>II Moral.</i>). Hence
        after his example, religious should desist from study.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. St. Paul (2 Thes. iii.), reproves those who neglected manual labour,
        and indulged themselves in curiosity and sloth. As then the acquisition
        of knowledge is curiosity, religious ought not to abandon manual labour
        for the sake of study.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now those who have been quoted above are not the originators of the
        error we are refuting. Julian the Apostate was the first to conceive
        this idea. He, as we are told in ecclesiastical history, forcibly
        prevented Christians from acquiring knowledge. Those therefore who
        imitate him, by forbidding religious to study, act in a manner opposed
        to the precepts of Scripture. We read, for instance, in Isaiah (v. 13):
        “Therefore is my people led away captive, because they had not
        knowledge.” “Because,” remarks the Gloss, “they would not have
        knowledge.” Now voluntary ignorance could not deserve punishment, were
        not knowledge praiseworthy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. In the Prophet Hosea (iv. 5) we read: “In the night I have made your
        mother to be silent. My people have been silent, because they had no
        knowledge; because you rejected knowledge, I will reject you that you
        shall not do the office of priesthood to me.” This text clearly shows
        how severely ignorance will be punished.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In Ps. cxviii. 66, we read: “Teach me goodness and discipline and
        knowledge.” On these words, the Gloss says: “Teach me goodness, i.e.
        inspire me, with charity; teach me discipline, i.e. give me patience;
        teach me knowledge, i.e. enlighten my mind. For that knowledge is
        useful, whereby a man becomes known to himself.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. St. Jerome writes to the monk Rusticus: “Let a book be never absent
        from your eyes or hand.” Again, “Love the knowledge of the Scriptures,
        and you will not love the vices of the flesh.” The same saint likewise
        writes to the monk Paulinus: “Holy ignorance is only profitable to
        itself, and inasmuch as when accompanied by the example of a good life
        it edifies the Church of Christ. It is harmful, when it is powerless
        against those who impugn her doctrine.” Hence the learning of the saints
        is preferable to the holiness of the unlearned. In the same epistle,
        after enumerating the books of holy Scripture, St. Jerome continues: “I
        beseech you, brother, let these books be the companions of your life and
        the subject of your meditation. I know nothing but these, and seek no
        other thing. Don’t you see that in this way you may on earth enjoy the
        Kingdom of heaven?” A heavenly life then consists in the, constant study
        of Holy Scripture.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. St. Paul points out that knowledge of the Scriptures is essential to
        preachers. For, he says (1 Tim. iv. 13), “Till I come attend unto
        reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine.” It is evident from this that
        a knowledge of what they are to teach, is necessary for those whose duty
        it is to preach and to exhort.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. St. Jerome writes to the monk Rusticus: “Spend much time in learning
        what you must later on teach.” Once more he writes to the same, “If you
        desire to enter the clerical state, study, in order that you may teach.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. St. Gregory says, in his <i>Pastorale</i>: “It is eminently necessary
        that they who accept the office of preachers should not desist from
        sacred study.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The life of religious is established primarily for contemplation;
        but, as Hugh of St. Victor says, reading is part of contemplation. Hence
        religious have a right to apply themselves to study.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. They are best capable of prosecuting their studies with success, who
        are least embarrassed by earthly ties. We read in Isaiah (xxviii. 9),
        “Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand the
        hearing? Those who are weaned from the milk, who are drawn away from the
        breasts.” The Commentary says, (<i>in VII Physic.</i>) that chastity and
        the other virtues, whereby the desires of the flesh are curbed, are
        special aids to the acquisition of speculative knowledge. Now as
        religious consecrate themselves to a life of continence and abstinence,
        they are peculiarly fitted for study.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. St. Jerome proves, moreover, in a letter Pammachius the monk that it
        is commendable in religious to devote themselves, not only to sacred
        learning, but to secular study. “If,” he says, “you are enamoured of the
        spouse knowledge, whom you have taken captive (that is to say if your
        heart is enthralled by the beauty of secular knowledge), cut off the
        tresses of this maiden, and remove the ornaments from her head, whereby
        I mean, heed not, when you study, the meretricious charms of language.
        Bathe your spouse, learning, in the salt of prophetic wisdom; and then,
        resting with her, speak saying: ‘Her left hand is under my head, and
        with her right hand she will embrace me.’ Then, shall this captive raise
        up around you a numerous offspring, and this Moabitess shall become an
        Israelite in truth.” Hence we may understand that it is permissible for
        religious to occupy themselves with secular branches of learning if,
        according to the rule of Holy Scripture, they avoid all that may be
        reprehensible.

        11. St. Augustine (<i>II De doctrina christiana</i>) says: “Those
        philosophers, especially of the Platonic School, whose teaching is true
        and consistent with the Faith, are not to be feared. On the contrary, we
        may make use of them, as we may despoil those who are in unjust
        possession of our property.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. On the words, “Daniel purposed in his heart” (Dan. i.), the Gloss
        says: “He who would not eat at the king’s table, lest he should thereby
        be defiled; he would never have studied the science of the Egyptians,
        had he considered it to be sinful. He studied it, however, not in order
        to follow it, but to judge and confute it. Now if a man, ignorant of
        mathematics, undertakes to argue with a mathematician, or if one who
        knows nothing of philosophy enter the lists against philosophers, what
        does he do, save expose himself to ridicule?”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From all that has been said, we see then that it is advisable for
        religious, and especially for preachers, to be learned, and that above
        all things they ought to have a good knowledge of Holy Scripture.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We will now proceed to answer the arguments brought forward by those who
        condemn learning in religious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The words (2 Tim. iii.), “Ever learning, and never attaining to a
        knowledge of the truth,” are a rebuke, not to such as are ever learning,
        but to those whose study withdraws them from the Faith, and who,
        therefore, never attain to the knowledge of the truth. Such men are “
        reprobates at heart and blinded to the faith.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. When St. Gregory says that the preachers of Antichrist are learned in
        the knowledge of this world, he refers to those preachers who make use
        of earthly learning to draw their hearers to sin and to worldly desires.
        For, in the context to the words we have quoted, he cites the following
        verse of Isaiah (xviii. 1): “Woe to the land, the winged cymbal that
        sends ambassadors by the sea, and in vessels of bulrushes upon the
        waters.” Upon these words, St. Gregory makes this comment: “Paper is
        made from the reed papyrus. What then shall we understand by the
        bulrushes, or reeds, of which the prophet is speaking, save earthly
        learning? The vessels of bulrushes then ate the hearts of worldly men;
        and to send ambassadors upon the waters in vessels of bulrushes, is to
        base our preaching on the arguments of carnal wisdom, and to attract our
        hearers to sin.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The words of the Gloss, quoted in the third objection, refer (as may
        be plainly seen by comparing this passage with many others) to preachers
        whom Antichrist will, at his coming into the world, send forth. Neither
        is the fact that the knowledge of the Old and the New Testament may be
        abused an argument against religious possessing such knowledge; unless
        we likewise say that because they may make a hypocritical display of
        innocence and purity of life, these virtues are therefore to be
        reprobated.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. To the objection that “science puffs up,” we reply that it certainly
        does so, unless it is accompanied by charity. Thus, the Gloss says:
        “Knowledge alone puffs up, and again: “Add charity to your knowledge,
        and your knowledge will be useful.” Hence to those who practise works of
        mercy, learning will not be very dangerous. But if we are to avoid
        knowledge because it leads to pride, we ought, on the same grounds, to
        desist from any good work. For, St. Augustine says, “Pride insinuates
        itself into good actions, in order to render them worthless.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. To the argument, founded on the example of St. Benedict, we reply
        that this Saint did not forego study from a dread of learning, but from
        fear of the effects of a worldly life and society. Thus, St. Gregory
        tells us that “being in Rome, St. Benedict applied himself to liberal
        studies, and to literature; but perceiving that many of those around him
        fell into sin, he withdrew the foot with which he had stepped out into
        the world, fearing lest, if he attained to worldly learning, he might
        likewise fall into the abyss of sin.” Therefore, they are worthy of all
        praise who abandon the life of worldly students and retire into a
        monastery, where they may prosecute their studies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. To the last objection proposed, we reply that idle and inordinate
        curiosity is a danger attendant not only on study, but on all other
        mental occupation; and that superfluous anxiety, which is engendered by
        curiosity, is reprehensible. But in the words of St. Paul (2 Tim. iii,),
        quoted as an argument against religious, the Apostle, as the Gloss
        points out, rebukes those who, from an undue desire for material gain,
        entangle themselves in their neighbours’ concerns. To speak of study of
        Holy Scripture as a life of idleness is flatly to contradict the Gloss.
        For, on the words of Ps. cxviii, “My eyes have fainted,” the commentary
        says: “As he is not idle who only studies the word of God, neither can
        he who performs manual labour be more justly accused of sloth, than he
        who is occupied with the study of divinity. Such learning is the
        greatest of all work; and Mary, who listened to our Lord, is preferred
        before Martha, who ministered to Him.”

          Method of Preaching</span

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        WE Will now proceed to examine the objections brought against religious,
        on the score of their methodical and carefully prepared manner of
        preaching.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Paul says, “not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should
        be made void” (1 Cor. i. 17). This the Gloss understands to mean, “not
        with eloquence or tropes of language. For the preaching of Christ does
        not need pompous words, lest it should proceed rather from the cunning
        of human wisdom than from truth.” It is, therefore, alleged that because
        religious preach with fluency and eloquence, they must be false
        apostles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. We read in the same Epistle to the Corinthians (ii, 1), “When I came
        to you, I came not in loftiness of speech,” i.e., says the Gloss, “I did
        not reason with you, nor use logical arguments. I displayed no wisdom.
        Neither did I, in my preaching, treat of the speculations of physical
        science.” St. Paul continues, “My speech and preaching was not in the
        persuasive words of human wisdom.” The Gloss adds, “even though my words
        were convincing, their power was not, like those of false Apostles, due
        to human wisdom.” Hence we are to conclude that religious who preach
        learnedly, must be false apostles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. St. Paul again, writes: “ For although I be rude in speech, yet not
        in knowledge” (2 Cor. xi. 6). The Gloss remarks upon this passage that
        the Apostle called himself “rude in speech,” because he did not use
        flowery language. The commentary further adds, “The words, ‘rude of
        speech,’ apply not to the Apostles, who were not eloquent, but to the
        false Apostles who knew how to combine choice phrases. But on account of
        the accuracy of their language, the Corinthians preferred the impostors
        to the preachers of the truth. For in religious matters, a power which
        convinces is needed, not a string of words.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. We read in the Second Book of Esdra (xiv.25): “Their children spoke
        half in the speech of Azotus... they spoke according to the language of
        this and that people. And I chided them and laid my curse on them.” The
        Gloss understands by “ the language of Azotus,” a rhetorical style of
        speech. Therefore, they who mingle rhetoric or philosophy with the words
        of Scripture are worthy of excommunication.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Isaiah says (i. 22): “Your wine is mingled with water. Now wine
        signifies the teaching of Holy Scripture. They, therefore, who mingle
        with this doctrine the water of human wisdom, are exceedingly
        reprehensible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. On the words of Isaiah (xv. 1): “In the night, Ar of Moab is laid
        waste,” the Gloss understands by “Ar of Moab,” the “adversary of God,
        viz., human wisdom, whose walls are built up by means of reasoning, and
        which in the night is laid waste and put to silence.” From this
        comparison we may see how much they are to be blamed who, in instruction
        on sacred subjects, employ earthly wisdom or eloquence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. We find in Proverbs vii., the following words: “I have covered my bed
        with painted tapestry brought from Egypt.” The Gloss comments: “The
        painted tapestry from Egypt is symbolic of flowery eloquence, or of
        cunning reasoning, derived from heathen sources. Heresy glories in
        adorning its pernicious doctrines with language of this description.”
        Hence we are to understand how criminal a thing it is to use eloquence
        and earthly learning in expounding the faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. St. Paulsays to Timothy (1Tim. iii. 7): “He (i.e, a bishop) must have
        a good testimony of those who are without, lest he fall into reproach,”
        “or,” as the Gloss says, “lest he be despised, both by believers and by
        infidels.” Now if certain religious preach in a learned and eloquent
        style, bishops who cannot equal them will be contemned by their people.
        Hence learned and eloquent preaching, practised among religious, is a
        danger to the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The foregoing arguments may be answered by the following words of St.
        Jerome addressed to the great orator of Rome. “What cause do you have to
        wonder” (the Saint asks) “that at times we, in our little writings,
        adduce examples drawn from the literature of the world? or that we sully
        the whiteness of the Church by the defilement of heathen authors? You
        would stop marvelling at our acting thus were you not wholly possessed
        by Tully, and ignorant of the Scripture and of their Commentators,
        Volcatius excepted. Who does not know that Moses and the prophets quote
        from the books of the Gentiles? and that Solomon makes use of the
        philosophers, citing some of their opinions, and refuting others?” St.
        Jerome then proceeds to show that from the time of the Apostles, the
        canonical writers and their exponents, have mingled human wisdom and
        eloquence with Holy Scripture. When he has enumerated a long list of
        writers who have thus acted, he concludes by saying: “All these have so
        filled their books with the sayings of the philosophers that it is
        difficult to know which most to admire in them, their secular learning
        or their knowledge of Scripture.” At the end of his Epistle, St. Jerome
        adds: “I beg you, therefore, to remind him who finds fault with us, on
        this score that it is unwise for a toothless man to envy the teeth of
        those who eat, or for a mole to grudge eyes to a goat.” Hence it follows
        that it is commendable to make use of human eloquence and wisdom in the
        Divine service, and that they who blame others for so doing resemble
        blind men who envy those who can see, and ignorant men who blaspheme
        against what they cannot understand, as we read in the Epistle of St.
        Jude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. St. Augustine (<i>IV De doctrina christiana</i>) says: “If any man
        wish to speak not only learnedly but eloquently, it will profit him to
        read, hear and try to imitate those who are eloquent.” Hence they whose
        duty it is to expound the Holy Scripture must be careful to speak
        eloquently and fluently, for the greater advantage of those who hear
        them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In the same book, St. Augustine continues: Someone may here enquire,
        whether they who have by their profitable authority compiled the canon
        for us, are to be called learned only, or eloquent also.” He goes on to
        prove that these authors are eloquent, and that they have adorned their
        style with rhetoric. He then concludes as follows: “Let us acknowledge
        then that our canonical writers are not merely learned, but likewise
        eloquent, making use of an elegance of style befitting them.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. In the book before quoted, St. Augustine says: An eloquent preacher
        must, in order to induce his hearers to do what is right, not merely
        instruct and delight them, but he must likewise convince them.” He
        shows, by eloquent passages taken from the Fathers, how those holy men
        instructed, charmed and convinced their hearers. Hence it becomes plain
        that he who has to preach or to expound the scriptures must make use
        both of eloquence and secular learning. The same lesson is taught by St.
        Gregory and St. Ambrose, who are both remarkable for elegance of
        diction. St. Augustine likewise Dionysius and St. Basil have
        interspersed their works with many passages culled from secular authors.
        Even St. Paul himself makes use of a heathen authority in his preaching,
        as may be seen in the eighteenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles,
        and in the first chapter of the Epistle to Titus.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. St. Gregory, commenting on the words in Job ix., “who makes Arcturus
        and Orion” etc., observes: “These names were given to the stars by
        devotees of earthly wisdom. As they who are wise with the wisdom of God
        make use, in Holy Scripture, of the wisdom of the world, so God Himself,
        the Creator of mankind, uses for the benefit of mankind our human
        language.” This passage is a further proof that the teachers of Holy
        Scripture may lawfully employ human eloquence and learning.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, we must remember that although an elegant style of preaching is at
        times commendable, it is likewise under certain circumstances
        reprehensible. It is reprehensible when it is used from motives of
        vainglory, or when beauty of language or a show of learning are esteemed
        as the chief essentials in preaching, and lead to the neglect or denial
        of the articles of faith which, being beyond the ken of human reason,
        are esteemed but lightly by earthly science. Again, they who consider
        eloquence and fluency of speech to be the chief essentials of preaching,
        strive to attract attention to themselves, rather than to the truths
        they utter. It was for preaching in this manner that the false Apostle
        incurred the reproach of St. Paul (2 Cor. xi. 6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The Gloss, in the comment on the words, “not in the persuasive words of
        human wisdom” (1 Cor. i.), remarks: “The false apostles, fearing lest
        they should be considered ignorant by the wise men of the world,
        preached Christ deceitfully by their human wisdom, for they studied
        human eloquence, and they avoided all that the world accounts foolish.”
        But it is praiseworthy to make use in preaching of a harmonious and
        learned style, provided this is done, not from ostentatious motives, but
        in order to instruct our hearers and to convince our opponents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is commendable to use eloquence and learning ia preaching when the
        primary motive in so doing is not elegance of diction, but the more
        profitable teaching of Holy Scripture, in whose service eloquence is
        used. When we act thus, we fulfil the words of St. Paul, “bringing into
        captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ” (1 Cor. x.,
        5). It was in this manner that the Apostle himself made use eloquence.
        Hence St. Augustine says (<i>IV De doctrina christiana</i>) that in “the
        Apostolic preaching, wisdom led the way and eloquence followed in its
        wake; but wisdom did not despise its follower eloquence.” The teachers
        of the Church, in later times have, for the same reason made a greater
        use of learning and eloquence; for the first chosen to preach the Gospel
        were not philosophers, but fishermen and peasants. These, in their turn,
        converted orators and philosophers. Thus our Faith consists not in human
        wisdom, but in the power of God, “that no flesh should glory in his
        eight” (1 Cor. i. 29). (See likewise the Gloss on the verse, “For see
        your vocation, brethren.”)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This explanation is our answer to the two first objections against
        religious preaching in an eloquent and learned style. To the third
        argument, we will reply in the words of St. Augustine (<i
          >IV De doctr. christ.</i
        >). When commenting on the words, “although I be rude in speech, yet not
        in knowledge,” he observes that St. Paul spoke thus, in condescension to
        his detractors, but that he does not acknowledge that he was ignorant.
        This is a proof that in a teacher learning is more profitable than
        eloquence. St. Angustine continues that the Apostle “did not hesitate to
        declare that he possessed learning, without which he could not have been
        the doctor of the Gentiles.” But even if we understand this text as an
        affirmation, we cannot assume that St. Paul made no use of eloquence in
        preaching. All that we can conclude is that he did not, like
        rhetoricians, make fluency and elegance of style his main object in
        preaching, or else that he had some defect in his speech. The Gloss
        understands the words, “although I be rude in speech,” to mean,
        “although I do not use ornamental language” or “although I have an
        impediment in my speech.” Now the false Apostles considered eloquence to
        be the essential part of preaching. They were, therefore, preferred by
        the Corinthians to St. Paul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the fourth argument we reply that when one substance is wholly
        transformed into another, there no longer exists a mixture. In a true
        mixture, one of two substances is converted into a third. Hence when a
        preacher, in expounding Holy Scripture, makes use of human learning
        subject to the truths of faith, the wine of Holy Scripture is not
        adulterated; it remains pure. Adulteration of the Scripture would
        consist in adding something to it which would destroy its truth. The
        Gloss observes: “He who, instead of correcting his hearers by means of
        the Scriptures, makes the Scriptural precepts subservient to their
        auditors does, by his teaching, adulterate the wine of truth.” These
        Words are a reply also to the fifth objection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The passage from the Gloss quoted in the sixth argument refers to that
        human wisdom which is hostile to God. Now human wisdom is always set up
        in opposition to the Divine wisdom when men consider human learning to
        be paramount in importance, and when they endeavour to make the truths
        of faith subservient to the teaching of human science. This error is the
        origin of all heresy. The Gloss gives the same explanation of the text
        which was quoted from Proverbs in the seventh objection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To the eighth argument we reply that good men ought not to be prevented
        from doing good for fear that others, who do not equally well, should be
        despised. It is, rather, those who make themselves contemptible who
        ought to be suppressed. Thus, the fact that certain prelates, from their
        worldly mode of life, are disedifying, when compared to religious, is no
        reason why religious should desist from a life of perfection. Again, the
        eloquence of religious is not to be blamed because the preaching of
        certain prelates is, on account of its lack of eloquence, but lightly
        esteemed.

          >Accusations Levelled Against Religious, on the Grounds That They
          Recommend Themselves and the Orders to Which They Belong</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        AS we have before said, religious are calumniated for performing actions
        which, in themselves are perfectly indifferent. We will now, therefore,
        enquire into the grounds on which these false charges are based.
        Religious are accused:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Of commending themselves and their order, and of procuring from
        others letters of recommendation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Of refuting, instead of bearing with, the detractions of their
        enemies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Of going to law.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Of causing their persecutors to be punished.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        S., Of desiring to please men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        S. Of rejoicing in the good which God wonderfully does through them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Of frequenting the courts of kings and princes.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The enemies of religious try to prove that they ought not to commend
        themselves, by quoting the verse of St. Paul (Rom. xvi.), “by pleasing
        speeches and good words,” together with the following commentary on this
        passage, taken from the Gloss: “False Apostles commend their tradition
        by fair words, which deceive the simple-minded.” Hence when religious
        commend their order and thus attract others to join it, they prove
        themselves to be false apostles. They resemble the Pharisees, to whom
        our Lord said: “Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because
        you go round about the sea and the land to make one proselyte” (Matt.
        xxiii. 15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. We read (2 Cor. iii. 1), “Do we begin again to commerhd ourselves?”
        As if, says the Gloss, “we were obliged by another to do so. Far be this
        from us.” Hence religious have no right to commend themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In the same chapter we read: “Do we need (as some do) letters of
        commendation to you, or from you? The men here referred to,” says the
        Gloss, are false apostles, who have no virtue to commend them.” Hence we
        see that to require letters of recommendation is to be a false apostle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Again, St. Paul says: “by manifestation of the truth commending
        ourselves” (2 Cor. iv.); “without,” as the Gloss says, “comparing
        ourselves with our adversaries.” Hence religious who commend their own
        order in preference to others are not true Apostles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. In the same chapter (2 Cor. iv. 5) the Apostle likewise says: “For we
        preach not ourselves, but Jesus Christ.” They who commend themselves
        preach themselves and are therefore no true imitators of the Apostles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. In the Second Epistle to the Corinthians (x. 12) we read the
        following words: “We dare not match or compare ourselves with some who
        commend themselves,” i.e., says the Gloss, “who commend themselves
        falsely.” Hence they who commend themselves would appear to be false
        apostles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Again, we read (2 Cor. x. 18), “Not he who commends himself is
        approved, but he whom God commends.” “Therefore, those who commend
        themselves are not commended by God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Again, “let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger
        and not your own lips” (Prov. xxvii. 2). “He who boasts and puffs
        himself up stirs up quarrel” (Prov. xxviii. 25). These two verses point
        out the unrighteousness of self-commendation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Our Lord says, (John viii. 54), “If I glorify myself, my glory is
        nothing.” Hence men who commend themselves, do most convincingly prove
        their own nothingness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        These are the chief arguments brought in support of the dictum that no
        one is justified in commending either himself or his order. We shall now
        proceed to show, from the Old and New Testaments that certain holy men
        have not hesitated to praise themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. In the Second Book of Esdras (v. 18), Nehemiah ays, in commendation
        of his own conduct, “Yet I did not require my yearly allowance as
        governor; for the people were very much impoverished. Remember me, O my
        God, for good, according to all that I have done.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Job says, (xxxi. 1), “I made a covenant with my eyes that I would not
        so much as think upon a virgin.” Again (xxiv. 14), “ I was clad with
        justice; and I clothed myself with my judgment as with a robe.” In both
        the chapters cited, the patriarch says many other things to his own
        praise.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. St. Paul says: “I venture not to speak of anything but what Christ
        has done through me” (Rom. xv.), and again in the same chapter, “From
        Jerusalem round about, as far as to Illyricum, I have replenished the
        Gospel of Christ,”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The same Apostle likewise says, “ I have laboured more abundantly
        than all of them” (1 Cor. xv. 10); and “If any man dare... I dare also”
        (2 Cor. xxi. 21). In the same epistle he writes many other things to his
        own commendation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Writing to the Galatians (i. 16), he says, “I did not condescended to
        flesh and blood.” In this and the following chapter we find many similar
        utterances. We also see that St. Paul commended his state of life. For
        (2 Cor. iii. 6) he says: “Who also has made us fit ministers of the New
        Testament, not in the letter but in the spirit.” In this chapter again,
        he adds many other expressions in praise of the Apostolic dignity. Hence
        a religious is justified in extolling his order and in thus attracting
        others to enter it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. St. Paul commends the perfection of virginity, and exhorts others to
        this state in which he himself lived, saying: “I would that all men were
        like myself “ (1 Cor. vii. 7). Hence it is permissible for religious,
        living in a state of perfection, to commend their mode of life.
        Self-commendation, therefore, though at times reprehensible, is
        likewise, on certain occasions, praiseworthy. St. Gregory in, his Homily
        upon Ezekiel <i>(ix, part I</i>), writes as follows: “Just and perfect
        men do at times extol their own virtues, and make known the favours
        which they have received. They are not inspired to act thus by motives
        of ostentation, but from a desire to draw those to whom they preach to a
        more perfect life by means of their own example. Thus, St. Paul, in
        order to divert the attention of the Corinthians from false preachers,
        tells them how he was rapt to Paradise. When perfect men speak of their
        own virtues, they imitate Almighty God who extols His own magnificence
        to men, in order to make Himself known to them.” St. Gregory proceeds to
        note the circumstances in which men are justified in commending
        themselves. Then, in the following words, he warns his readers against
        rash and ill-considered self-praise. “We must remember,” he says, “that
        perfect men never disclose their own good deeds, unless urged to do so
        by necessity, or by desire of their neighbour’s profit. Thus St. Paul,
        after narrating his virtues to the Corinthians, concludes by saying: ‘I
        have become foolish; you have compelled me.’ At times good men are
        obliged to speak of themselves, if not for their neighbours’ sake, at
        least for their own. Thus, holy Job, under the pressure of physical
        pain, and reproached by his friends for impiety, violence to his
        neighbour and oppression, was driven to the verge of despair. Then, in
        self-defence, he called to memory his good deeds, saying: ‘I was an eye
        to the blind,’ etc. He did not enumerate his virtues from desire of
        praise, but, merely, to reanimate his confidence in God.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is clear then from what has already been said, that men are justified
        in commending themselves not from motives of vanity, but for the sake of
        their own spiritual advantage, or that of their neighbour. The most
        cogent reason which should induce a perfect man to commend his state of
        perfection, is, the wish to enkindle in others, a desire for the same
        perfection. Thus, it is permissible for a Christian to commend
        Christianity to infidels, in order to convert them to the Faith, and in
        proportion to the sanctity of men, we see them possessed with this zeal
        for souls. Thus St. Paul said (Acts xxvi. 29), “Little or much, I wish
        before God that not only you but all who are listening to me today would
        come to be as I am.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We now proceed to reply to the objections adduced against religious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The words quoted from the Gloss on Rom. xvi, about those who falsely
        commend their traditions refer, as we see by the context, to the
        traditions of false preachers who endeavoured to induce the Gentiles to
        follow Hebrew customs, and tried by their fluent language to commend
        these rites to the ignorant heathens. The word “tradition” is not
        applied to any state of true religion, but to false doctrine and heresy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Our Lord rebuked the Pharisees (Matt. xxiii.) not for their anxiety
        to make proselytes, but for imbuing their converts with erroneous ideas,
        or for setting them so bad an example that at the sight of their vices,
        their proselytes relapsed into paganism. For this cause, the Pharisees
        deserved greater condemnation (see Gloss on Matt. xxiii.). The words
        quoted ‘from 2 Cor. iii, “Do we begin to commend ourselves,” mean that
        the Apostles extolled themselves, not from vainglory, but inspired by
        the motives mentioned by St. Gregory above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. To the third argument we reply that St. Paul did not prohibit the use
        of letters of recommendation. He merely showed that they were not
        needful for true Apostles, as they were for false teachers who had no
        virtues to commend them as the Gloss explains. At times, however, holy
        men do need letters of commendation. They want them, not on their own
        account, but for the sake of others, who know neither their virtue nor
        their authority. Thus, St. Paul commended Timothy, saying: “Now if
        Timothy comes, see that he be with you without fear. For he works the
        work of the Lord” (1 Cor. xvi. 10). Again, in the second chapter of the
        Epistle to the Philippians (19), he says, “I hope in the Lord Jesus to
        send Timothy to you shortly... for I have no man so of the same mind.”
        Again, in the Epistle to the Colossians (iv. 10), he writes, “Mark, the
        cousin of Barnabas, touching whom you have received commandments.” And
        writing to the Romans (xvi. 1) he says: “I commend to you Phoebe, our
        sister” etc. Thus we see that in the Apostolic times, it was customary
        to provide teachers or other persons who must be sent to distant
        churches with testimonials, or letters of recommendation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. To the fourth argument, we answer that as holy men do not commend
        themselves, for the sake of their own glory, but for the advantage of
        others, so they likewise sometimes prefer themselves to others. Thus
        just men prefer themselves to sinners, in order that sinners may be
        avoided and justice imitated. Thus St. Paul says (2 Cor. ii. 23), “They
        are the ministers of Christ (I speak as one less wise) I am more.”
        Sometimes, also, good men commend themselves in order that they may be
        held in credit by men; for if they are despised by those to whom they
        preach, they cannot influence them. We know that St. Paul preferred
        himself, in one point, to the other apostles, though they were true
        apostles. For he says (1 Cor. “His grace in me has not been void; but I
        have laboured more abundantly than all they.” Now they are the less
        reprehensible who prefer their state to one less perfect, in proportion
        as such a comparison is divested of anything that savours of vainglory.
        In this manner, St. Paul (2 Cor. iii.) compares the ministers of the New
        Testament to those of the Old Law; and he prefers the status of Doctor,
        to which he belonged, to the other ranks in the Church. On this point he
        says (1 Tim. v. 17), “Let the priests that rule well be esteemed worthy
        of double honour, especially those who labour in the word and doctrine.”
        It may be said that the Gloss, on this passage, as quoted above, is
        misinterpreted. For St. Paul speaks of the recommendation, not of words,
        but of deeds; whereby the Apostles commended themselves to the
        conscience of men. He shows likewise that the true Apostles proved
        themselves by their works to be better than the false Apostles. Hence
        when the Gloss says, “without comparing them to their adversaries,” the
        signification is that the Apostles did incomparably more than their
        adversaries. Hence the true meaning of the Gloss, is the exact contrary
        of that assigned to it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The answer to the fifth objection is given in the following words of
        the Gloss. “We preach not ourselves, i.e., our preaching is directed not
        to our own honour or advantage, but to the glory of Christ.” Now the
        Saints at times commend themselves; but they do so not for their own
        glory, but to the praise of God, and for the spiritual benefit of their
        neighbour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6.-7. The sixth argument is answered by the following words from the
        Gloss. “We do not communicate with certain other men (i.e., false
        apostles), who are not sent by God nor approved by Him, but who commend
        themselves by certain actions.” From these words, we cannot conclude
        that they who are sent by the prelates of the Church, may not commend
        themselves, when God commends them so munificently by bestowing the
        gifts of grace upon them. This is likewise the answer to the seventh
        objection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8.-9. To the eighth and ninth objections we reply that the authors cited
        in them, speak of the self-praise whereby some men commend themselves
        inspired by motives of vain glory.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The tenth objection is answered by the following passage from the
        interlinear commentary on the words, “If I glorify only myself,” etc.
        The glory of those who glorify themselves is nothing. But the case is
        far otherwise with those whom God glorifies by the bestowal of His
        heavenly favours.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        WE will next consider the arguments, whereby, the assailants of
        religious try to prove that they are not justified in offering any
        resistance to such as detract them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The Gloss on the words (1 Cor. xii.), “ No one can say the Lord
        Jesus,” etc., has the following passage: “ Christians ought to be humble
        and to bear reproach and not to desire to be flattered.” Therefore,
        religious who do not endure reproach prove that they are not true
        Christians.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. In 2 Cor. xii. 12, St. Paul says: “The signs of my Apostleship have
        been wrought on you in all patience.” On which text the Gloss observes:
        “The Apostle makes special mention of patience, as being an essential of
        virtue.” Hence they who perform the apostolic function of preaching
        ought to be remarkable for their patience, according to the words of the
        Psalmist (xci. 15), “They will be very patient, so that they can
        proclaim” [Vulgate]. They ought to bear with the malice of their
        detractors and to offer no resistance to it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. “Have I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?” asks
        St. Paul (Gal. iv. 16). The comment of the Gloss on this verse is: “The
        carnal-minded man will not suffer himself to be reproved as though he
        were in the wrong.” Hence they who will not bear rebuke show that they
        live according to the flesh. Again, on the words in Phil. iii., “Beware
        of dogs,” the Gloss says: “Understand that such men are dogs, not
        because they lack reason, but because they are used to barking at truth
        to which they are unaccustomed.” Again “as dogs,” says the Gloss, “obey
        habit rather than reason, so false apostles bark at truth in an
        irrational manner and rend it.” They therefore who rage against those
        who reprove them for their vices, hereby prove that they are false
        Apostles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. St. Gregory says, in his Pastorals: “He who is bent upon wrong doing,
        and desires that others should conceal his sin, shows that he loves
        himself better than truth. For, he will not suffer truth to be defended
        at his own cost.” “God is truth” (John xiv.). They, therefore, who will
        not allow themselves to be corrected, show that they love themselves
        better than God. They are, consequently, in a state of damnation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. What has been already said on the subject is further confirmed by the
        words of the Book of Proverbs (ix. 8), “Do no rebuke a scorner, lest he
        hate you. Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.” It is likewise
        supported by the following passages from the Old and New Testament.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        “He who hates to be reproved, walks in the steps of a sinner” (Sirach
        xxi. 6). “Bless those who persecute you; bless and curse not” (Rom. xii.
        14). “Bless those who curse you; pray for those who calumniate you”
        (Luke vi. 28). “We are reviled and we bless; we are persecuted and we
        suffer it” (1 Cor. iv. 12). All the texts which we have cited seem to
        prove that it is the duty of perfect men, and especially of preachers of
        the Gospel, not to resist those that speak ill of them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It can however be shown that at times apostolic men are justified in
        opposing their calumniators, as we shall now see.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. “We do not say,” says St. Paul (Rom. iii. 8), “as we are slandered
        and as some affirm that we say, let us do evil that there may come good.
        Their damnation is just.” The commentary of the Gloss on this passage,
        runs as follows: “ Certain perverse men, who misunderstand us and who
        are inclined to blame us, assert that this is our teaching. Their
        damnation is just.” In these words, the Apostle infers that no credit is
        be given to his detractors; and thus he resists them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. In his 3rd Epistle (x.), St. John writes: “If I come, I will
        advertise the works which he does, with malicious words prating against
        us.” On this verse, the Gloss comments in the following terms. “We ought
        not, by our own fault, to stir up detraction against ourselves, lest we
        cause our slanderers to perish. If our enemies, animated by their own
        malignity, revile us, we ought to endure such treatment patiently, to
        the increase of our merit. It is right, however, at times to suppress
        their slanders, lest by propagating evil reports against us they gain
        the ears and harden the hearts of those who would otherwise have
        listened to our preaching.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In the following words St. Paul shows (2 Cor. x. 10) that he thought
        it right to resist those who slandered him. “For his epistles, indeed,
        say they are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak and his
        speech is contemptible. Let such a one think this that such as we are in
        word, by epistles when absent, so also we will be in deed when present.”
        The Apostle thus treats those who speak ill of him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. St. Gregory in his Homily upon Ezekiel (ix. Part 1) says, “They who
        occupy so conspicuous a position that their lives are regarded as an
        example for imitation, ought, if they can do so, to silence the
        detractions propagated against them. For these slanders may reach the
        ears of those who would otherwise have listened to their preaching. They
        may cause them to refuse to hear their words, and thus become hardened
        in their sins.” Now they who practise a life of perfection are regarded
        by all men as a model for imitation. It is, therefore, their duty to
        suppress the calumnies set afoot against them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. St. Augustine (<i>II de Trinit.</i>) writes: “Modest and gracious
        charity gladly admits the kisses of the dove; but chaste and cautious
        humility avoids the dog’s bite; solid truth likewise repels it.” Hence
        we see that detraction is, at times, to be avoided, and, at times, is to
        be combatted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. We learn the same lesson from the example of a multitude of Saints.
        Thus Saints Gregory Nazianzen, Jerome, Bernard, and many others wrote
        apologies and epistles defending themselves against the attacks of their
        enemies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the matter of reproof, we must draw a distinction between those who
        rebuke others in a legitimate manner and with a desire for their
        correction, and those who bring false charges against their neighbour.
        Men of the first class should be not only tolerated, but loved. Those of
        the second category must be patiently endured, when their calumnies do
        not cause much scandal or produce much injury amongst those who hear
        them. At other times, however, they must, if possible, be suppressed,
        not on account of the personal reputation of their victims, but for the
        sake of the public welfare. But if such detractions cannot be silenced,
        they must be borne with patience. Thus St. Gregory says, in the Homily
        before quoted, “As just men may at times, without arrogance, acknowledge
        the good that they do; so they can, without undue solicitude for their
        personal reputation, silence the tongues of those that speak against
        them. But, when their slanderers cannot be silenced, they must be
        patiently endured. Calumny in itself is not to be feared. We must only
        be on our guard, lest the dread of being slandered should cause us to
        desist from doing right.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We will now examine, and refute, the arguments of our opponents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. True Christians bear reproof, when administered to them for the sake
        of correction. They resist, however, accusations brought against them in
        order to overthrow their work. More especially do they resist, when such
        charges are blasphemies, directed not only against their person, but
        against the truth which they preach.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Apostolic men ought certainly to practise patience. When they resist
        detraction, they do so not out of impatience, but from love of truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Carnal-minded men hate those who rebuke them in charity. It is not,
        however, carnal minded to oppose those who calumniate the truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The passage of the Gloss quoted in the fourth argument refers to men
        who unreasonably slander the truth and injure its preaching. They who,
        under pretext of patience, permit falsehoods about the truth to be
        disseminated are like the “dumb dogs, not able to bark, of which Isaiah
        speaks (lvi. 10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. If they who will not suffer the truth to be defended at their own
        expense show that they love themselves more than the truth, they equally
        love themselves better than the truth who, rather than suffer their own
        peace to be disturbed, leave the assailants of truth unanswered. Hence
        it is love of truth which inspires holy men to resist its detractors.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The following reply will serve as an answer to all the remaining
        objections. The authors quoted in these objections counsel us to love
        those who correct us justly, and they forbid us to pursue, with hatred
        or impatience, those that malign us. They advise us, on the contrary, to
        love and pray for our detractors. Holy men amply fulfil this duty; even
        while they refute the charges brought against them by their enemies.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        WE will now consider the arguments brought forward to prove that
        religious ought not to go to law, nor to allow themselves to be defended
        by force of arms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. In the First Epistle to the Corinthians (vi. 7), we find the
        following passage: “There is plainly a fault among you that you have
        lawsuits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you
        not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?” On these words, the Gloss
        observes: “Perfect men should simply to ask for what belongs to them,
        avoiding contention or legal proceedings.” Hence as religious are in a
        state of perfection, they ought not to contend with anyone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. our Lord says, (Matt. v. 40): “ If a man will contend with you in
        judgment and take away your coat, let go your cloak also unto him.”
        “These three precepts,” remarks the Gloss, “embody the perfection of
        justice.” Hence religious, who profess to lead a life of perfection,
        ought not to go to law; they ought rather to suffer themselves to be
        despoiled of their goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Again, we read, (Luke vi. 29), “Do not stop him who takes away your
        cloak... If someone takes away your goods, do not ask for them back.”
        The Gloss says: “This rule respecting our garments applies likewise to
        our other possessions.” Religious, therefore, who are specially bound to
        the observance of these precepts, ought neither to prevent others from
        robbing them, nor to ask for their property to be returned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Our Lord gave the following order to His Apostles: Whoever does not
        receive you, nor hear your words, go forth from that house or city,
        shake off the dust from your feet” (Matt. x. 14). The same precept is
        recorded by Luke (ix. 5). From these words we see that Apostles, and
        Apostolic and perfect men, ought not to litigate if they are not
        received into a town, or hamlet or a society.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. “If any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom nor the
        church of God” (1 Cor. xi. 16). They, therefore, who institute legal
        proceedings depart from the Apostolic rule of perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Charity does not seek her own,” the Apostle writes (1 Cor. xiii. 5),
        or as the Gloss explains, “requires not that her own property should be
        returned to her.” Therefore men who go to law to secure the restitution
        of their goods, have not charity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. St. Gregory (<i>XIII Moral.</i>) says: “He that for the sake of some
        earthly possession disagrees with another, shows that he loves a
        material good better than his neighbour. This is contrary to the order
        of charity.” They then who disturb their neighbour’s peace in order to
        recover their own property, sin against charity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. St. Jerome gives the following rule: “As long as threefold truth [cf.
        <i>Summa theologiae</i>, I, q. 16, a. 1, ad 1] be preserved, anything
        should be done or left undone to avoid scandal.” Now a man can, without
        any injury to the threefold truth, suffer himself to be despoiled of his
        goods; and if he, in order to recover them, institutes a lawsuit, to the
        disturbance and scandal of his neighbour, he is acting against charity.
        Food is essential for the maintenance of life; but we may abstain from
        food, in order to avoid scandalising our neighbour. “If meat scandalizes
        my brother I will never eat flesh” (1 Cor. viii. 13). If then in order
        to avoid giving scandal, we are to refrain from so necessary a thing as
        food, we ought, with far greater reason, to renounce any other temporal
        good rather than disturb or scandalize our neighbour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On the other hand, we can adduce proofs that holy men are at times
        justified in availing themselves of the protection of the law.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. St. Paul, when in danger of being delivered to the Jews, appealed to
        the hearing of Augustus (Acts xxv) i.e., he appealed to the Roman law.
        An appeal is to go to a higher judgment. Therefore, perfect men may go
        to law.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. We know, by the example of the same saint that it is at times lawful
        for apostolic men to be defendedby armed force. For in the Acts of the
        Apostles (xxiii.) we read that St. Paul procured his rescue from the
        snares of his enemies by means of an army.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. We know further that it is permissible for holy men sometimes to
        defend themselves, especially in the case of an ecclesiastical judgment.
        For, when Paul and Barnabas were at Antioch, no small contest arose
        between them and those who taught the brethren that they must be
        circumcised. Then Paul and Barnabas went up to the Apostles in Jerusalem
        about this question. St. Paul, alluding to this discussion, speaks of
        the “ false brethren, smuggled in, who came in privately to spy our
        liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into
        servitude. We did not submit to them even for a moment” (Gal. ii. 4).
        Hence religious and perfect men may appeal to an ecclesiastical court in
        defence of their liberty.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. St. Gregory expressly says (<i>XXXI Moral.</i>) “that religious may
        defend their property by legal means” On the words of Job (chap. x. 16),
        “he has laboured in vain,” St. Gregory says: “When the care of our
        material property imposes upon us the necessity for travelling, we must,
        if we are despoiled of our possessions, at times endure our loss. At
        other times we must, while taking every pains to preserve charity,
        prevent such robbery. We should act thus not only to secure our own
        property, but, still more to prevent those who would pillage us from
        losing their souls. Hence in defending our possessions against rapine,
        our chief care ought to be not so much to guard ourselves against loss,
        as to save our enemies from committing sin.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. St.Gregory likewise commenting on the words of Job (xxiv. 26), “he
        goeth forward to meet armed men,” says, “we are generally left in peace
        and quiet if we care not to confront the wicked for the sake of justice.
        But, if our heart is inflamed with desire for eternal life and our mind
        is truly enlightened, we shall, as far as circumstances permit or the
        cause require, throw ourselves into the breach in defence of
        righteousness. We shall go forth to intercept the wicked in their
        misdeeds, even though they do not seek us out. For, when unjust men aim
        their blows at the virtue that we love in others, they wound us also,
        even though they may seem to venerate our person.” Hence we see that it
        is the duty of perfect men to defend others who may be attacked, even
        though they themselves are not provoked.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. It is a charitable office to deliver the oppressed from their
        oppressors. “I broke the jaws of the wicked man, and out of his teeth I
        took away the prey “ (Job xxix. 17). “Deliver those who are being led to
        death” (Prov. xxiv. 11). “Rescue the poor, and deliver the needy out of
        the hand of the sinner” (Ps. lxxxi. 4). Now we are bound to perform
        charitable offices, primarily towards those most closely connected with
        us. Hence, as religious are most closely bound to their religious
        brethren, they ought in charity to oppose those who oppress their order.
        By this and by all the preceding arguments, we learn that religious not
        only may, but ought to resist the violence and artifices of their
        enemies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We must remember that the assailants of religious orders attack them,
        sometimes in spiritual and sometimes in temporal matters. When religious
        are oppressed in what concerns their spiritual rights, they ought to
        resist their oppressors with all their might, especially when the
        questions involved affect not only themselves, but others. For religious
        embrace the religious life solely in order to be free to devote
        themselves to spiritual interests. If their spiritual liberty is
        curtailed, their object in becoming religious is frustrated.
        Consequently, as it is a point of perfection for them to carry out their
        object, it is likewise a point of perfection for them to resist all the
        obstacles which may be placed in the way of its attainment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If religious are attacked as to their material interests, perfection
        demands that so long as their injury be of a private and personal
        nature, they should bear it patiently, as St. Gregory reminds us, lest
        by resistance they incite their enemies to violence. If, however, the
        damage inflicted on them affects not only their own, but the common
        welfare (even in temporal matters), they ought, as far as possible, to
        resist their oppressors. It is not perfection but indolence and
        cowardice to endure such oppression when it might be resisted. For, as
        we have just said, everyone is bound in charity to defend his neighbour
        from injury as far as he is able to do so, according to the words of the
        Book of Proverbs (xxiv. 11): “Deliver those who are being led to death”
        etc.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We will now proceed to examine the objections brought against our
        proposition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. By the words of St. Paul, quoted in the first objection, some things
        are forbidden to all men; others are forbidden to the perfect only. All
        men, as we know by the Gloss, are forbidden to plead a cause before a
        heathen tribunal, or to assert their rights by contention or by fraud.
        Perfect men are forbidden to go to law in order to obtain the
        restoration of their property. This rule applies, however, as Gratian
        tells us (<i>XIX, quaest. I, cap. Episcopus</i>) to the restoration of
        private property. It is as lawful for them to recover common
        possessions, as it is for them to hold them. For their common property
        belongs not to themselves, but to the Church. Therefore, when they sue
        for its restitution, they are seeking to recover what they hold for the
        Church. This Gloss is not authentic but magisterial. It is taken from
        St. Augustine, who holds that it is allowable and pardonable for
        imperfect men to go to law, but that such a course is not becoming in
        the perfect. But, if it be not lawful for those in a state of perfection
        to appeal to a legal tribunal, such a course cannot be permissible for
        bishops, since the episcopal state is one of higher perfection than is
        the religious. Otherwise, an appointment to a bishopric would not be
        promotion for a religious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The fact that a man has embraced a state of perfection does not render
        things unlawful for him which before were lawful, unless by vow he has
        bound himself to refrain from them. Hence it is no more unlawful for a
        man to go to law after he has become a religious than it was before he
        embraced the religious state, unless indeed, by instituting legal
        proceedings, he should violate his vow of poverty or should occasion
        scandal. Litigation would be an infraction of the vow of poverty, were a
        religious to contend for some private property, since by his vow the
        possession of such property is interdicted to him. It may be added, and
        perhaps with truth, that the words of the Gloss to which reference has
        been made do not apply to a state of perfection, such as is the
        religious state. For religions have no personal possessions; and hence
        the Gloss could not say absolutely that they might claim their own
        property. The words of the Gloss must, rather, be understood to refer to
        the perfect in charity, i.e., to those who possess perfect charity, in
        whatsoever state of life they may be. Although they do not sin by making
        a legal claim to their property, they nevertheless, by so doing,
        diminish the perfection of their charity. Hence the Gloss does not say
        that it is forbidden for perfect men to go to law, but that it is
        unbecoming in them to do so. But in certain cases it is not even
        unbecoming in them to institute legal proceedings.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (a) The first of such cases, is, when a dispute has arisen concerning a
        spiritual matter. Thus, we read in the Acts that when dissension arose
        at Antioch on the question of circumcision, Paul and Barnabas went to
        Jerusalem to submit the point to the Apostles (Acts xv). Again, St. Paul
        speaks of “false brethren smuggled in” (Gal. ii. 4).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (b) The second case is that in which contention arises on some matter
        (even though it be a temporal concern) which may be a cause of spiritual
        harm. St. Paul, although he longed “to be dissolved and to be with
        Christ” (Phi. i.), appealed to the Roman law for release when he saw
        that his death or imprisonment would be an obstacle to the spreading of
        the Gospel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (c) The third case is that in which material loss may accrue to another,
        especially to the poor. We defraud others if, through our negligence, we
        suffer them to be robbed. If they are under our charge, our fault
        becomes more grievous. By such negligence, we do not offer to God a
        perfect sacrifice. For “he who offers sacrifice of the goods of the poor
        is like one who sacrifices a son in the presence of his father” (Sirach
        xxxiv. 24).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (d) The fourth case is when the contention involves our neighbour’s
        spiritual welfare, in as much as he would lose his soul were he to keep
        the property of another. Hence St. Gregory, on the words of Job (xxxix.
        16), “he has laboured in vain,” says: “At times it is our duty to bear
        with patience the robbery our goods; at other times we must charitably
        resist those who cheat us. This we do, not from self interest, but lest,
        through their dishonesty, they should lose their souls” (<i
          >XXXI Moral.</i
        >).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (e) The fifth case is when the example of dishonesty would deprave many:
        “Because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the
        children of men commit evils without any fear” (Sirah viii. 11).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2 and 3. We answer the second and third objections that, as the Gloss
        says, “the perfection of justice is established in three precepts.”
        First, “if one shall strike you on the right cheek, offer him the
        other.” Secondly, “if anyone will contend with you in judgment and take
        your coat from you, let your cloak go also.” Thirdly, “whoever would
        force you to go one mile, go with him another mile.” The third precept
        is not to be understood literally, for we do not read that it was so
        interpreted, either by Christ or by His disciples: “If anyone force us
        one mile, we must be prepared, if need be, to go another with him.”
        Again, St. Augustine, speaking of the first of these three precepts,
        says in his book <i>De mendacio</i>, that it is to be understood to
        signify that a man must be prepared, for the sake of truth, to suffer
        not only buffets, but any torments in a spirit of charity to those that
        inflict them. Literal obedience to the precept is not enjoined; since
        neither our Lord nor St. Paul turned the other cheek. The third precept
        must be understood in the same sense, namely, that a man must be ready
        to endure any material loss in the cause of righteousness and charity.
        But, as we have said before, cases arise in which, without any prejudice
        either to charity or truth, we are justified in legally asserting our
        claims to property.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Our Lord ordered His Apostles to shake the dust from their feet as a
        witness against those who refused to receive them. “Shake off the dust
        from your feet, as a testimony to them” (Matt. x. 14). The Gloss,
        commenting on the words, “shake off the dust,” says: “Do so, as a
        witness of the travail which you have fruitlessly endured on their
        behalf.” This shall be an appeal to to Divine judgment. That this is
        what our Lord meant, we know by His words: “Amen, I say to you, it shall
        be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for
        that city” (Matt., x 15). By these words, our Lord instructs His
        disciples, to depart from those that will not receive them. For they,
        like infidels, are reserved for the final judgment of God. St. Paul says
        of unbelievers: “Those who are without, God will judge” (1 Cor. v. 13).
        Those that are within are committed to the judgment of the Church. Hence
        if any man desire to be received into the Church, and those who belong
        to the fold refuse to communicate with him, he should appeal not to the
        judgment of God, but to the tribunal of the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Contention is forbidden to all those who are weak in faith. The words
        of St. Paul (1 Cor. vi.), “Already indeed there is plainly a fault,” are
        thus explained by the Gloss: “The audacious clamour of contention wars
        against the truth.” The same explanation is given of the words in the
        Epistle to the Romans (i. 29), “murder, contention.” Hence they who
        appeal for justice, without noisy assertion of their claim, are not
        contentious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. It is not true that none can, without a violation of charity, demand
        the restitution of their goods. What is true is that when avarice leads
        a man to demand such restitution, he is not acting in charity. On the
        words, “charity seeks not her own,” the Gloss says: “Charity seeks not
        her own, for she does not love money.” However, as we have seen from a
        passage of St. Gregory, already quoted, zeal for fraternal correction
        may at times stimulate a man to demand the restoration of his property.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. If a man go to law, he need not necessarily be in discord with his
        neighbour. Although peace of heart should not be lost for the sake of
        any earthly gain, it does not follow that it is never permissible to
        make a legal claim to our property. Peace of mind may be preserved in a
        law court, as on a battle field. Otherwise, war would be always
        unlawful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. A man who justly claims the restitution of his goods does not
        actively give scandal. If scandal is taken at his action, he is merely
        the passive cause of such scandal. There are two kinds of scandal. There
        is a Pharisaical scandal, by which men, out of malice, take scandal at
        their neighbour and cause scandal to him. When our Lord was told that
        the Pharisees were scandalized at Him, He said: “ Let them alone; they
        are blind and leaders of the blind” (Matt. xv. 14). There is likewise
        the scandal taken by weak and ignorant persons. When possible, we must
        avoid giving this scandal; but we must not do anything wrong out of fear
        of occasioning it. Now it is wrong to suffer the property of the Church
        to be pillaged; and, even at the risk of giving scandal, we must resist
        such injustice. Thus St. Thomas of Canterbury defended the rights of the
        Church, at the sacrifice of his life, making no account of the scandal
        taken by the King of England. Even if he could, without sin, have
        suffered the Church to be robbed, the fear of being a passive cause of
        scandal, would not have been sufficient cause to justify him in
        permitting such pillage to take place. It is also possible to obviate
        giving scandal to weaker brethren by speaking to them gently and
        pointing out that it is really more to our neighbour’s advantage to
        check him in a course of injustice than it would be to suffer him, by
        indulgence, to fall into a habit of dishonesty. Furthermore, a man is
        more strictly bound to preserve himself from taking scandal than to
        avoid scandalizing others. Therefore, if he knows that unless he
        reclaims his own possessions, he will himself be scandalized, it is his
        duty to demand them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Though it be true that food is essential to the preservation of life,
        this proposition does not apply to every kind of food. A man may abstain
        from one dish, and live on another. Hence it may be better, for the sake
        of avoiding scandal, to refrain from one kind of food, rather than to
        abandon certain temporal possessions. For, by not requiring their
        restitution, we may, as has been said, occasion sin.

        WE must next expose the grounds on which religious, are expected to
        allow their enemies to persecute them with impunity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. We read in the Gospel of St. Matthew (v. 44): “Do good to those who
        hate you; pray for those who persecute and calumniate you.” Again, in
        Luke (vi) the same precept is given. If we are to do good to our
        persecutors, we certainly ought not to cause evil to befall them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. “Behold I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves” (Matt. v., 16).
        On this passage, the Gloss comments in the following words: “He who
        undertakes the office of preacher, ought not to inflict evil, but to’
        suffer it.” Hence preachers who procure the punishment of their
        persecutors, prove themselves, thereby, to be false preachers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. “To no man rendering evil for evil” (Rom. xii., 17). Again in the
        same chapter it is written: “Revenge not yourselves, my dearly beloved.”
        Hence those who cause their adversaries to be punished, act in
        disobedience to St. Paul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. We read in the Legends of Saints Simon and Jude that when the general
        of the King of Persia wished to punish the heathen priests who had
        persecuted these Saints, the Apostles cast themselves at his feet and
        implored the pardon of their enemies. For, they said, they did not wish
        to be the cause of death to any of those to whom they came to preach
        salvation. Hence, they who cause their assailants to be punished are not
        true, but false apostles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. “As then he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him that
        was after the Spirit, so also it is now” (Gal. iv. 29). St. Augustine
        observes, on this passage: “Who are those who are born according to the
        flesh?—The lovers of the world. Who are those who are after the
        Spirit?—The lovers of heaven and of Christ,” They, therefore, who cause
        others to be perseouted, must, seemingly, be lovers of the world.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. “ Let us not be made desirous of vainglory” (Gal. v. 26). The Gloss
        says that “vain glory is the desire for victory, where no reward is
        gained.” Now those who wish to see their enemies worsted are desirous of
        victory. Hence it is by no means permissible for holy men to wish to see
        persecution arise against their opponents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. When St, Luke and St. John said to our Lord: “Lord, do you want us to
        command fire to come down from Heaven and consume them?” He rebuked
        them, saying, “You do not know of what spirit you are.” They, therefore,
        who are filled with the Holy Spirit ought no to cause others to be
        punished.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On the other hand, examples can be adduced, proving that holy men have
        inflicted chastisement, or caused it to be inflicted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Our Lord “drove the buyers and sellers out of the temple; their money
        He poured out and their tables He overthrew” (John ii. 14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. St. Peter condemned Ananias and Saphira to death, in punishment of
        their deceit (Acts v.).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. St. Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked upon Elymas the
        Magician, and said: “O full of all guile and of all deceit, child of the
        devil, enemy of all justice, you never stop perverting the right ways of
        the Lord. And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you; you shall
        be blind, not seeing the sun for a time” (Acts xiii. 10). Here we have
        an example of an Apostle, both rebuking and punishing a sinner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. In the first Epistle to the Corinthians (v. 3), we read the following
        words: “I have already judged, as though I were present, him that has
        done so. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you, being gathered
        together with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus deliver such
        an person to Satan, for the destruction of his flesh.” The meaning of
        this, is, says the Gloss, “that Satan may inflict on him bodily
        torments.” Here, we have another proof of chastisement, inflicted by an
        Apostle on an evildoer.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. In the Canticle of Canticles (ii. 15) we read: “Catch us the little
        foxes.” By which words the Gloss understands, “Pursue and overcome
        schismatics and heretics.” “For (as another Gloss explains) it will not
        suffice for us to spend our lives in preaching and setting a good
        example, unless we correct those that are in error, and preserve the
        weak from their snares.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Dionysius says (<i>IV De Div. Nom.</i>) “that the angels are not
        wicked, although they punish wicked men. Now the ecclesiastical
        hierarchy is modelled on the heavenly. Hence a man may, without any
        malice, punish evildoers, or procure their punishment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. We read (<i>23 Qaest. cap. Qui potest</i>), “ To neglect to check
        evil is to encourage it; and he who fails to put down public crime may
        legitimately be suspected of secret connivance at it.” Hence not only is
        it lawful to resist and punish offenders, but it is sinful not to do so.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Job (xxxix. 21) says of the horse, by which preachers are typified,
        “He goes to meet armed men”, because, says the Gloss, “a preacher
        opposes injustice in defence of the truth, even when this duty is not
        imposed upon him.” Thus we see that holy preachers must wrestle with
        impiety, even when impious men do not attack them. But, the Saints act
        this way not out of hatred, but out of love. Thus, St. Paul, as the
        Gloss observes, when he delivered, “such a one to Satan for the
        destruction of the flesh” (1 Cor. V. 3), did so that the Spirit might be
        saved; whereby we see that his act was inspired not by malice, but by
        charity. The Gloss further adds: “Elijah and other good men also
        punished certain sinners by death. By so doing, they inspired the living
        with a salutary fear, and diminished the number of sins which might have
        been committed by those whom they condemned to death.” Hence the
        chastisement inflicted by holy men on sinners cannot strictly be called
        persecution. For they do not punish them for the sake of making them
        suffer, but in order either to correct or check them in their sins, or
        else in order to deliver others from their oppression, or to restrain
        others from crime by fear of punishment. Sometimes, however, this
        chastisement may metaphorically be called persecution. Thus, St.
        Augustine writing to the Count Boniface (<i
          >23, quaest. 4, cap. Si ecclesia</i
        >) says “that the persecution inflicted by the wicked on the Church of
        Christ is unjust, and that inflicted by the Church on sinners is just.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. David says (Ps. xvii. 38), “I will pursue after my enemies... till
        they are consumed.” Again, “The man that detracted his neighbour in
        private, I persecuted.” (Ps. c. 5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We will now proceed to answer the arguments used by the enemies of
        religious, to prove that they are acting unlawfully in causing their
        persecutors to be punished.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. It has already been proved that when holy men cause punishment to be
        inflicted on their enemies, they act not out of malice, but out of love.
        Hence they do their enemies good, rather than harm.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Preachers ought not, in causing their adversaries to be punished, to
        make their discomfiture their chief object. Their aim in chastising
        their enemies ought to be their conversion, or the benefit of others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. He who, out of zeal for virtue, causes another to be punished, does
        not return “evil for evil,” but rather good for evil; since the
        punishment inflicted is of benefit to him who suffers it. Punitive
        measures are at times remedial, says Aristotle (2 Ethic). And Dionysius
        observes (<i>IV De Div. Nom.</i>): “It is not an evil thing to be
        punished, but to deserve punishment.” The prohibition against returning
        blow for blow means that we must not strike another out of malice or
        from revenge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The Saints, as we have said, never punish others, nor cause, them to
        be punished, save out of desire for their amendment, or for the public
        welfare. If men are suffered to commit crime with impunity, they wax
        bold and become hardened in sin. “Because sentence is not speedily
        pronounced against the evil, the children of men commit evils without
        any fear” (Eccl. viii. 11). Therefore, the Saints inflict penalties on
        evildoers; but, when they see that indulgence would be more profitable
        to them, they remit the punishment Web is due. The Gloss remarks on the
        words, “You know not of what spirit you are” (Luke ix.), “It is not well
        always to take vengeance on the guilty, for at times mercy will avail
        more in bringing them to patience, and the fallen to amendment.” For
        this reason, Simon and Jude averted punishment from their enemies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The lovers of this world unjustly, as St. Augustine says, persecute
        those who love God; and they, in turn, are justly persecuted by them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The saints, as we have already said, do not cause others to be
        punished, save in the hope of causing them to amend. The benefit of
        their neighbour they count as their reward. Hence they cannot be said to
        incur the stigma of vain glory.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The seventh objection is answered by the Gloss. The Apostles, it
        explains, were untutored men at the time they spoke thus; they were
        ignorant of the way in which they might cause others to amend.
        Therefore, they spoke, not out of zeal for their neighbour’s correction;
        nor out of desire to check vice; but from aspirit of revenge. our Lord
        reproved them for their ignorance. At a later time, however, when he had
        instructed them in a spirit of true charity, he gave thom authority to
        punish sinners. Such power they exercised towards Ananias and Saphira,
        whose death was profitable both in inspiring the living with awe, and in
        preventing the guilty man and woman from adding to their crimes. The
        same comment is made by the Gloss on the words in 1 Cor. v. 3, “to hand
        over such a one to Satan.” Or we may say that our Lord forbade the
        disciples to call down fire on the Samaritans, because He knew that they
        would be more easily converted by mercy. The Gloss also accepts this
        view: “The Samaritans who, in this place, were saved from fire, believed
        with greater firmness.”

        WE will, in this chapter, examine the arguments brought forward to prove
        that religious ought not to seek to please men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. We read in Ps. lii. 6, “God has scattered the bones of those who
        please men; they have been confounded, because God has despised them.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. St. Paul says (Gal. i. 10): “If I yet pleased men, I should not be
        the servant of Christ.” Hence religious, who profess to be the servants
        of Christ, ought not to seek to please men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. We read in 1 Cor. iv. the following words: “Even to this hour we both
        hunger and thirst.” On this passage, the Gloss says, “The Apostles, by
        preaching fearlessly and without flattery and by reproving the
        evildoers, won no favour with men.” Hence religious, who are bound to
        preach the truth freely, ought not to seek to please men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. “He who is charged with the gifts of the bridegroom and seeks to find
        favour with the bride, commits adultery in his heart,” says St. Gregory
        (<i>Pastoral.</i>). Now the bride is the Church, the bridegroom being
        God’s minister. Therefore, religious who, although ministers of God,
        seek the friendship of men, are guilty of spiritual adultery.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The desire to win human favour is the outcome of self-love; and, as
        St. Gregory remarks (<i>Pastoral.</i>), “love of self renders a man
        indifferent to his Creator.” Hence, in so far as a man strives to render
        himself popular with his fellow-men, he becomes estranged from God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Religious ought to beware of anything savouring of vice; and, as
        popularity may render a man suspected of vice, as Aristotle says (<i
          >IV Ethic.</i
        >), religious ought not to desire to be popular.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        These are the chief arguments brought forward by those who seek to prove
        that religious ought, under no circumstances, to desire to win human
        favour. It will now be our duty to expose the fallacy which underlies
        these objections.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. St. Paul says (Rom. xv. 2), “ Let every one of you please, his
        neighbour to good, unto edification.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. He likewise says, “Be without offence to the Jews and to the Gentiles
        and to the church of God, as I also in all things please all men” (1
        Cor. x. 32).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. St. Paul likewise says (Rom. xii. 17), “providing good things, not
        only in the sight of God, but also in sight of all men.” Now this
        exhortation would be meaningless if it were wrong for men to consider
        how they may please their neighbours. Therefore, everyone ought to take
        thought how he may please others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. We read in St. Matt (v. 16), “So let your light shine before men that
        they may see your good works, and may glorify your Father who is in
        heaven.” Now men will not be moved to glorify God by the sight of good
        works which do not please them. Hence it is the duty of everyone to take
        care that his works may be such as will please his neighbour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We must, however, remember that three circumstances may make it unlawful
        in us to seek to please men. First, desire of human approbation must not
        be the primary motive of our actions. We ought to seek to please men for
        the sake of their salvation and for the glory of God. This is what is
        meant by the words in the <i>Pastorale</i> of St. Gregory: “Good priests
        should seek to please men, not in order to be loved by them, but in
        order that by winning their esteem, they may draw them to the desire of
        truth. They ought to wish to gain the hearts of their hearers in order
        to lead them to the love of God. For it is very difficult for an
        unpopular preacher to gain an audience.” He adds, “St. Paul points out
        this lesson in the words: ‘I please all men in all things.’” St. Paul
        likewise says: “If I should please men, I should not be the servant of
        Christ.” Hence St. Paul did please men, and did not please them. For
        when he wished to please them, he desired to win their favour not for
        himself, but for the truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Secondly, we may not displease God in order to please men. This is the
        interpretation given by St. Jerome to the words in Galatians, “if I
        should please men,” etc. “If” he says, “we can please both God and men,
        we must please men. But if we cannot please men without displeasing God,
        we ought to please God rather than men.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thirdly, it happens at times that a man does all that in him lies, and
        yet he is rashly judged by others. If he does his best, and yet is
        misjudged by men, he ought to be content that his conscience assures him
        that he is approved by God, without distressing himself on account of
        the false judgments of men. The Gloss makes the following comments on
        the words, “if I should please men” etc. (Gal. i.): “Some men are false
        judges, backbiter, and fault-finders. They try to cast suspicion on what
        they do not see, and to asperse deeds on which no suspicion has
        alighted. Against such as these, the testimony of our own conscience is
        our best defence.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We shall have no difficulty in refuting the remaining objections.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1 and 2. “ God has scattered the bones of those who please men,” is to
        be understood, as applying to those who make the favour of men the chief
        object of their ambition, and who, in order to please mortals, are ready
        to offend God. The words of Gal. i., “If I should please men,” are to be
        understood in the same sense.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although preachers of the truth may be hated by sinners who are
        unwilling to amend their lives, they gain the favour of those who desire
        instruction. “Rebuke a wise man and he will love you” (Prov. ix 8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The words of St. Gregory, quoted as an objection to our proposition,
        refer to those who make it their sole ambition to find favour with men,
        and who desire to be loved with a love due to God alone, even though
        they do not commit any overt offence against Him. That this is the sense
        of the passage is clearly shown by its context, which runs as follows:
        “He is an enemy to our Redeemer, who desires, for the sake of his good
        works, to be loved by the Church.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The words of St. Gregory, quoted in the fifth objection, are to be
        understood, as referring to that inordinate self love which causes men
        to seek, merely for their own sake, to please their neighbour.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The word to seek popularity (esse placidum) used in the sixth
        objection, means not simply one who seeks to please men, but one who
        desires to an excessive degree to please them, and who is willing to do
        wrong for the sake of pleasing them. He who merely seeks to please
        others in an ordinate manner ought to be called a friend, and is so
        called by the Philosopher.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        THE following arguments are the chief of those adduced to prove that
        religious ought not to rejoice at the good works, which God effects by
        means of them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. It is written in the Gospel of Luke (x. 20), “Rejoice not in this
        that spirits are subject unto you.” Religious ought not, therefore, to
        rejoice on account of any of the other great works which God effects by
        means of them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Job says (xxxi. 25): “If I have rejoiced over my great riches, and
        because my hand had gotten much– If I beheld the sun when it shined, and
        the moon going in brightness, and my heart in secret rejoiced– ” “May
        evil befall me,” is the conclusion to be understood, though it is not
        expressed. St. Gregory (<i>22 Moral.</i>) makes the following commentary
        on this passage: “Knowledge had not puffed up this holy man; therefore
        he scorned to exult at his wealth. The greatness of his work had not
        elated him; therefore, he did not look at the brightness of the sun. He
        did not covet renown; therefore he took no heed to the moon, sailing in
        her radiance through the heaven:” Hence it is clear that no one ought to
        rejoice on account of knowledge or fame, or mighty works.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The degree in which men glory in anything, is proportionate to the
        joy they take in it. Now man should not glory in his possessions. “Let
        not the wise man glory in his wisdom, and let not the strong man glory
        in his strength, and let not the rich man glory in his riches” (Jer. ix.
        23). From this text we learn likewise that no man should glory in the
        good effected by him. Our adversaries strive from it to prove that
        religious have no right to glory in the great works which God
        accomplishes by means of them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The fallacy of this argument is shown by the words which we read in
        the Acts of the Apostles (ii. 22). We are told that at the preaching of
        some of the faithful, “a great number, believing, were converted to the
        Lord. And the tidings came to the ears of the Church that was at
        Jerusalem touching these things; and they sent Barnabas as far as
        Antioch. When he came saw the grace of God, he rejoiced.” Here, we see
        how the Apostles were filled with joy, at the good work done in the
        Church, by their brethren and fellow-labourers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. We, further, read (Acts xv. 3) that “Paul and Barnabas being brought
        on their way by the Church, passed through Phenice and Samaria, relating
        the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the
        brethren.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. St. Paul again addresses the Philippians (iv. 1): “ Dearly beloved
        brethren, and most desired, my joy, and my crown.” He evidently and
        openly rejoiced in those whom he had converted to Christ. Why then may
        not religious and other men rejoice at the great works which God effects
        by, their means, and especially at the conversion of others?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. We return thanks only for what we consider to be a favour granted to
        us. Now no one receives a favour without rejoicing at it. If then it is
        not permissible to rejoice at great deeds which God does by means of us,
        we have no reason to thank Him for them. This proposition is, of course,
        absurd.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Aristotle says (<i>I Ethic.</i>): “No one is just who does not
        rejoice at works of justice.” This sentiment agrees with the verse of
        the Psalm (xcix. 2): “ Serve the Lord with gladness.” No work of the
        Lord is so magnificent as is the work of justice, whereby He is served,
        Therefore, holy men ought to rejoice that God effects this great work by
        their instrumentality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We must bear in mind that joy appertains only to what is good, and that
        it ought to be proportioned to the degree of goodness existent in the
        things at which we rejoice. Hence we ought to find our greatest joy in
        the highest good. We may rejoice in other things, but we ought not to
        find perfect joy in them. This is to be sought for only in the highest
        good. Now he who rejoices at the good which God effects by his means
        rejoices rightly, if he places his joy in God, i.e., if he rejoices
        because the good wrought through his instrumentality tends to the glory
        of God, and to his own and his neighbour’s salvation. But if he rejoices
        in any other spirit, he rejoices in his own works and commits sin. Hence
        St. Gregory, explaining the words of Job already quoted, says (<i
          >22 Moral.</i
        >): “At times holy men rejoice on account of the good repute in which
        they are held. But as they only desire to be esteemed for the sake of
        doing more good amongst those to whom they preach, they rejoice when
        they are thought well of, not for the sake of their own honour, but for
        the profit of others. It is one thing to seek human favour, and another
        to rejoice at the improvement which we effect in our neighbour?’
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The remaining objections will easily be answered.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The words, “rejoice not in this, that spirits are subject to you”
        (Luke x. 20), are to be understood as an order to the Apostles to
        rejoice, not on account of their victory over evil spirits, but on
        account of the glory of God. The Gloss says: “They are forbidden to
        rejoice at the abasement of the devil, who fell through pride; they are
        rather to exult at the honour given to God.” Or else we may understand
        that the Apostles were commanded not to rejoice at the fall of Satan as
        if that were the highest good. For he might have been overcome without
        any merit on their part. Their chief joy was to be, as our Lord told
        them, that their names were “written in Heaven: (Luke x. 20).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The words quoted from Job (xxxi. 25) are to be understood of the joy
        which produces elation of spirit. For it is pride for a man to rejoice
        in the works wrought by God through his agency as if they were a subject
        for vain glory.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. He who refers the glory of his works to God, rejoices not in himself,
        but in God, to whom he refers all that can be a cause for glory.

        Wit will now examine the grounds, on which, it is alleged that religious
        ought not to be intimate with the families of royal, or noble,
        personages.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. In the Gospel of St. Matthew (xi. 8) we read: “Behold those who are
        clothed in soft garments are in the houses of kings.” Now “soft
        garments” are not fitting for religious, who profess to lead a life of
        penance. Therefore, religious ought not to frequent the houses of kings
        and princes. The Gloss says (on this text): “Preaching and austerity of
        life are not compatible with the dwellings of those that live in luxury,
        and are haunted by flatterers, clothed in soft garments.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. He spoke with them concerning the Kingdom of God (Luke ix.). On these
        words the Gloss says: “Christ imparted the nourishment of heavenly grace
        not to those who dwelt in idleness in the synagogues, i.e, the abodes of
        earthly dignity, but to those who sought Him in desert places.” If then
        the religious Weis ordained as a means of acquiring grace, religious
        ought not to dwell among those who are in the high places of this world.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. St. Jerome writesin the following terms to Paulinus the priest: “Shun
        assemblies of men, exalted offices, honourable salutations, banquets,
        and all such pleasures which, as chains, bind you to the earth.” Now it
        is at the courts of princes that assemblies and banquets are chiefly
        held. Therefore, religious ought not to frequent courts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Boethius says in his book <i>De Consolatione</i> that they who glory
        in power, seek either to reign themselves or to become attached to
        reigning sovereigns.” Now, as it is highly reprehensible in religious
        who have chosen a life of humility to glory in power, they ought not to
        frequent the households of kings.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Honour leads to pride of life, which is one of the three things most
        to be reprobated. Religious who have renounced the world, ought to avoid
        all that pertains to honour. Now, as preaching at the courts of kings or
        princes or before a large concourse of people is an honourable function,
        religious ought not to undertake it, nor should they frequent the
        company of royal personages.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This proposition is manifestly false, as is proved by the example of
        many holy men who have dwelt among kings and princes. Joseph lived at
        the court of Pharaoh, who “made him master of his house, and ruler of
        all his possessions” (Ps. civ. 21). Moses was reared by the daughter of
        another Pharaoh, and was instructed in Egyptian lore (Acts vii.). Nathan
        the prophet was numbered among the confidants of David and of Solomon.
        Daniel dwelt in the court of the king of Babylon, who made him governor
        of all his provinces and, at his desire, set Sidrach, Misach, and
        Abednego over public works. Commenting on the text, “Daniel himself was
        in the king’s palace” (Dan. ii. 49), the Gloss says that “he dwelt at
        the king’s side, and was honoured by him, and was familiar with him.”
        Nehemiah was the cup-bearer of the Persian King (Nehem., i.). Mardochai
        became ruler in the court of Assuerus (Esther viii.).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the New Testament we likewise find examples of holy men who dwelt
        with royal personages. Thus St. Paul writes: “All the saints salute you,
        especially those that are of Caesar’s household” (Phil. iv.). We read
        that St. Sebastian was one of the first favourites at the court of
        Diocletian. St. John and St. Paul, in like manner, were attached to the
        household of Constantine Augustus. St. Gregory likewise says in the
        Prologue to his <i>Morals</i> that “he dwelt in an earthly palace, to
        which many of his monastic brethren had, inspired by fraternal charity,
        followed him.” It is not, therefore, unlawful for religious or perfect
        men to dwell in the courts of Kings.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In order to establish this controversy on a solid basis, we must remark
        that holy men seek certain things for their own sake, and certain other
        things for the sake of their neighbours. For their own sake, they would
        prefer to adhere to Christ by contemplation, either in this world, in so
        far as human infirmity will permit them so to do, or in the next world,
        where contemplation is made perfect. For the sake of others, however,
        charity urges them at times to interrupt their much-loved contemplation,
        and to expose themselves to the stress of active life. Hence while by
        desire they enjoy the quiet of contemplation, for the sake of their
        neighbour’s salvation they patiently endure the toil of action. Thus St.
        Paul says (Phil. i. 23): “I am straitened between two: having a desire
        to be dissolved and to be with Christ... but to abide still in the flesh
        is needful for you.” St, Gregory says (<i
          >Homil. XLII. part 1 super Ezech.</i
        >): “One sole consolation remains to the soul enamoured of the heavenly
        Bridegroom, but not yet admitted to His presence. She delights in
        working for the salvation of her neighbour, and in enkindling in the
        souls of others the fire of Divine love.” This is the reason why the
        saints at times mingle with men, and seek the favour and friendship of
        the great. They are led to do so, not from desire of popularity or
        advancement, but in order to lead others to salvation. For as St.
        Augustine says (<i>8 Confess.</i>): “They who are well known are in a
        position to assist many in this work of their salvation; and they are
        followed by many.” The Saint adds: “The enemy is most surely defeated in
        him whom he has held most securely, and by whose example he holds many
        others.” Now many proud men are held by the reputation of nobility, and
        many others by that of authority. Hence the saints, inspired by charity,
        seek the friendship of those who are noble and powerful, in order, by
        their means, to become an instrument of salvation to many. Did they act
        thus for any other motive, their conduct would be reprehensible. St.
        Gregory says (<i>Pastorale</i>), “He who desires to be useful to others,
        gives an example to all, since the only begotten Son of God left the
        bosom of the Father for the salvation of all men.”

        With this preface, we shall be able, easily, to refute all the
        objections made by our opponents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The words quoted from St. Matthew (xi.), “They who are clothed in
        soft garments,” apply manifestly to those who frequent the houses of
        kings for the sake of luxury. The words of the Gloss, quoted in the same
        objection, refer to those who dwell idly in cities, or indolently enjoy
        high offices. But the saints repose only in God; they find their rest in
        Him alone. To be obliged to consort with a number of men, or to accept
        posts of honour is to them weariness, rather than an enjoyment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. St. Jorome’s advice to Paulinus, is a warning against leading a
        public life, for the sake of pleasure, instead of for utility. He shows
        this plainly by speaking of banquets and all such pleasures. He makes
        this evident by the words which are subjoined: “You should flee from
        these as from the chains of pleasure.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        S. The words of Boethius contain a great truth. But it does not follow,
        because they who glory in power seek the company of the powerful, that
        therefore everyone who frequents the society of the powerful must
        necessarily glory in power. For, as we have already shown, the saints
        seek the company of men in high station, from a very different motive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Again, though it be an honourable function to preach to a great
        concourse of men, the Saints do so not from desire of celebrity, but for
        the glory of God, imitating Him who said: I seek not my own glory but
        that of Him who sent me” (John vii. 18).

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        WE have hitherto spoken of the false judgments passed by the enemies of
        religious about things. We will next consider the falsehoods uttered by
        them about persons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It may perhaps appear that detraction uttered against persons ought to
        be borne by them without refutation. St. Gregory says, “ The blame of
        wicked men is a testimony to the innocence of our life. For if we are
        offensive to those who displease God, it is a proof that our life must
        be upright” (<i>IX Homil. part 1, super Ezech.</i>). Again, we read
        (John xv. 18), “If the world hates you, know that it has first hated
        Me.” St. Paul likewise teaches us that the judgments of men are to be
        lightly esteemed, saying (1 Cor. iv. 3): “To me it is a very small thing
        to be judged by you, or by man’s day.” We can especially afford to
        despise human opinion when we have the testimony of a good conscience,
        and when we can say with Job: “My witness is in heaven” (xvi. 20).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On further consideration, we shall, however, see that it is more prudent
        for religious to silence the tongues of their detractors. This is
        evident for three reasons:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. First, when religious are defames, it is not the reputation of one
        man, or even of two or three that suffers. The calumny affects the whole
        body of religious. Hence their defamers ought to be manfully resisted,
        or else the whole flock of Christ may be torn by the teeth of wolves.
        Our Lord says: “The hireling sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep
        and flees” (John x. 12). The Gloss remarks that by the “wolf,” is meant
        either, “they who ravage the Church by violence, or the devil who,
        spiritually, scatters the faithful.” The cowardly pastors whom Christ
        calls hirelings, are thus reproved by Ezekiel (xiii. 5): “You have not
        gone up to face the enemy, nor have you set up a wall for the house of
        Israel.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2.”Religious ought to resist their detractors, because they not only
        require a good conscience for their own sake, they likewise need fair
        reputation in order to carry weight with those to whom they preach. The
        Gloss, speaking of detraction, says on the words of St. Paul (Gal. iv.),
        “Cast out the handmaid,” etc., “All who seek for earthly happiness in
        the Church, belong still to Ishmael. These are they who wage war against
        spiritual men and defame them, and whose lips utter evil things, and
        whose tongues are full of guile.” Therefore religious ought to resist
        those who thus detract them. St. Gregory likewise observes, in the
        homily already quoted: “They who occupy a position in which they are
        looked up to as an example, ought, if possible, to silence the voice of
        their detractors, lest the faithful, believing these calumnies, refuse
        to listen to preaching and become hardened in a sinful life.” St. John,
        writing to Gaius (<i>Ep. iii</i>), says of Diotrephes: “If I come, I
        will advertise the works which he does with malicious words prating
        against us.” And St. Paul writes in like manner (2 Cor. x, 10), “His
        epistles, indeed, they say they weighty and strong, but his bodily
        presence is weak, and his speech is contemptible.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Religious ought to resist their detractors because they strive not
        only to defame religious life, but to abolish it entirely. They strive
        to induce bishops to cause all men to avoid religious, and to refuse to
        assist them in their needs. This policy is represented by the following
        words from Isaiah (vii. 5), “Syria has taken counsel against you, unto
        the evil of Ephraim and the sons of Romelia, saying, ‘Let us go up to
        Judah and rouse it up, and draw it away to us,’ but the Lord God says:
        ‘It shall not stand, and this shall not be.’” The same description of
        plot is mentioned in Jeremiah (ii. 19): “They devised counsels against
        me, saying: ‘Let us... cut him off from the land of the living, and let
        his name be remembered no more.’” But, as Jacob said, “let not my soul
        go into their counsel” (Gen. xlix, 6). The cruelty of such detraction
        ought not to be tolerated; for religious may say with Esther (vii. 4),
        “We are given up, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain and to
        perish. And, it would be better we were sold as bondsmen and bondswomen.
        That evil might be borne with, and I would have mourned in silence.” In
        Sirach (iv. 26) we find this exhortation: “Accept no person against your
        own person, nor against your soul a lie.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In order that religious may effectually resist their detractors, we will
        note the four forms which detraction generally takes. If any evil exists
        among good men, (1) that evil will be exaggerated. (2) Doubtful facts
        will be given to the world as certainties. (3) Falsehoods will be
        invented. (4) Good deeds will be travestied to wear a bad appearance.

          >First of All by Exaggerating Any Evil That May Exist Among Them</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now any evil which may exist among religious can be exaggerated in three
        ways.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Firstly, in order of time. Thus, a crime committed by a religious before
        his conversion may be recalled to the public mind, in order to put him
        to shame. The words, “Men shall be lovers of themselves” (2 Tim. iii.)
        are applied to religious. They are accused of coming from a life of
        crime into a religious order, which their enemies call “creeping into
        houses.” St. Gregory exposes the falsity of this accusation. Commenting
        on the words, “Iron is taken out of the earth” (Job xxviii.), he says
        (<i>18 Moral.</i>): “Iron shall be taken out of the earth when the
        champion of the Church is delivered from the earthly bonds that have
        held him captive.” A man ought not to be despised for what he formerly
        was, after he has begun to lead a new life. St. Paul, after enumerating
        the vices of the Corinthians, concludes by saying (1 Cor. vi. 11): “Such
        some of you were, but you are washed, you are sanctified, you are
        justified.” Hence the interpretation given by the opponents of religious
        to the text is contrary to the meaning of St. Paul. For the Apostle did
        not intend to say that those to whom he wrote had led sinful lives, and
        afterwards begun to creep into houses. Creeping into houses is one of
        the vices for which he rebukes them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Secondly, if any evil prevails among religious, their enemies exaggerate
        it with regard to persons. Thus the faults committed by two or three
        individuals are attributed to all religious. Thus it may be said that in
        certain cases some men are not content with the food set before them,
        but seek better living elsewhere. Even should this accusation is
        occasionally true of certain individuals, that is no reason why it
        should be levelled at all religious in general. Hence St. Augustine,
        writing to Vincent the Donatist, says (<i
          >23 Quaest. VI, cap. Quicumque</i
        >): “If any man, not justly, but avariciously, retains the goods of the
        poor which you held in the name of the Church, the fact is displeasing
        to us. You, however, will have some difficulty in proving it. We bear
        with some men whom we are not able to correct or to punish. We cannot
        forsake the granary of the Lord on account of the chaff contained
        therein; nor can we break His nets, because of the worthless fish that
        they have caught.” For the fact that certain men among religious commit
        crimes is no reason for defaming the whole religious body. Otherwise,
        the treachery of Judas ought to have been attributed to the whole
        College of the Apostles on account of the words, “Have not I chosen you
        twelve, and one of you is a devil?” (John vi. 71). St. Gregory,
        commenting on the words of Cant. (ii. 2), “As a lily among thorns, so is
        my beloved among the daughters,” says: “There cannot be bad men without
        good, nor good without bad.” Of the bad we may use the words of St. John
        (1 Epist. ii. 19): “They went out from us; but they were not of us.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thirdly, the enemies of religious exaggerate the degree of any evil that
        may prevail among them. Thus, the venial offences of religious are
        represented to the world as heinous crimes. St. John tells us that no
        one can live in the world without sin. “If we say that we have no sin,
        we deceive ourselves “ (1 John, i. 8). But the men of whom we have been
        speaking magnify the slight faults observable even in the perfect, and
        speak of them as though they were serious crimes. Thereby they disobey
        the exhortation of the Book of Proverbs (xxiv. 15): “ Lie not in wait,
        nor seek after wickedness in the house of the just,” They call religious
        false apostles, because they say that they seek hospitality the houses
        of the wealthy, where they will be best fed; because they assist others
        in their affairs in order to be entertained by them; because they accept
        material assistance from those to whom they preach; and on other grounds
        of the like nature. Now though such actions be faulty, they cannot be
        called grave crimes, nor ought those guilty of them to be on that
        account named sinners or false apostles. The Gloss, commenting on the
        verse in Gal. ii., “We, by nature, are Jews and not of the Gentiles,
        sinners,” This epithet (i.e. sinner), is not used in the Scriptures of
        those who, although they live upright and praiseworthy lives, are not
        wholly free from sin.” This observation applies to those who see the
        mote in their brother’s eye, but not the beam in their own (Matt. iii.
        3). The Gloss further remarks that “many, laden with grave sins, are so
        filled with envy, hatred and malice that they would rather blame and
        condemn their neighbour for his lesser offences, than strive to correct
        him.” In short, those who venomously attack religious for small faults,
        and remain unconscious of their own serious defects, are precisely those
        of whom our Lord said that they strain a gnat and swallow a camel (Mat.
        xxxiii. 24).

        WE will next consider how the enemies of religious propagate against
        them accusations, of which the truth is doubtful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Doubt exists about future events, and also about the workings of a man’s
        heart. Nevertheless, the enemies of the religious life do not hesitate
        to assert that religious will eventually become both immoral and
        unbelieving. They also profess to be able to read the hearts of
        religious, and accuse them of desiring popularity, of seeking their own
        glory instead of the glory of God, and of many other things of like
        nature. Such accusations convict their authors of rash judgment. “Let us
        not therefore judge one another, any more,” says St. Paul (Rom. xiv.
        13). The Gloss hereon observes: “We judge rashly, if we pass sentence on
        the secret things of another man’s heart, or if we foretell what a man,
        who now seems either good or bad, will be in the future.” Such judgments
        proceed either from pride or envy; and the authors of them prefer rather
        to blame and to backbite other men, than to correct or improve them.
        They likewise lay claim to the power of Almighty God, to whom alone it
        belongs to read the future and the secrets of man’s heart. Isaiah says
        (xli. 23), “Show the things that are to come hereafter, and we shall
        know that you are gods.” Jeremiah likewise says (xvii. 9): “The heart is
        perverse above all things, and unsearchable; who can know it? I am the
        Lord who search the heart.” St. Paul writes (1 Cor. iv. 5), “Judge not
        before the time.” The Gloss remarks on these words: “It is an insult to
        the judge, if his slave presume to anticipate him in pronouncing
        sentence.” These words apply to those who pass judgment on causes which
        the Lord reserves to Himself.

        WE have still to consider the falsehoods propagated against religious by
        their enemies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The opponents of religious are not content with calumniating their
        victims; they strive likewise to cast upon them suspicion of being
        guilty of heinous crimes. They assert that religious are worthy of
        detestation, and that they are unfit society for other men. They fill up
        the measure of their detraction by declaring religious to be responsible
        for all the evils which have ever come upon the Church, or which ever
        shall assail her; and they declare that religious are likewise
        accountable for every trouble under which the Church at present labours.
        They are further accused of being the false apostles who disturbed the
        primitive Church, and also of being the thieves, robbers and “creepers
        into houses” against which the Church has for all time been warned; and
        they are also said to be those heralds of Antichrist who, in the latter
        days of the Church, are to bring danger upon her.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We will in due order refute these calumnies. Religious are accused of
        being false apostles. In order to show how untruly this epithet is
        applied to religious, we must first examine what is meant by false
        apostles. In the Holy Scripture we find other expressions of the same
        kind, such as false prophets, and false Christs. The following words of
        St. Peter (2 Pet. ii, 1), “But there were also false prophets among the
        people, even as there shall be lying teachers among you” apply to all
        these disseminators of falsehood. For the office of a preacher and an
        apostle, is to be a mediator between the Lord and His people, by
        preaching the Word of God. Thus St. Paul says (2 Cor. v. 20): For
        Christ, therefore, we are ambassadors, God as it were, exhorting by us.”
        Now a man may be a false apostle or a false prophet for one of two
        reasons. First, he may not be sent by God: “I did not send prophets, yet
        they ran; I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied” (Jer. xxiii.
        21). Secondly, a false apostle or prophet will proclaim not the Word of
        God, but his own inventions: “Hearken not to the words of the prophets
        that prophesy to you and deceive you; they speak a vision of their own
        heart and not out of the mouth of the Lord” (Jer. xxiii. 16). Both these
        two accusations are brought against false prophets and apostles in the
        following words of Ezechiel (xiii, 6): “They see vain things, and they
        foretell lies, saying: ‘The Lord says’; whereas the Lord has not sent
        them” Alluding to the pertinacity of such false teachors, the Prophet
        adds: “They have persisted to confirm what they have said.” When
        Jeremiah was condemned as a false prophet, he hastened to exculpate
        himself from both these charges. He said: “In truth the Lord sent me to
        you.” This refers to the first accusation. He adds: “to speak all these
        words in your hearing.” This is his defence against the second charge
        (Jer. xxvi. 15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The false apostles of the New Testament were recognisable likewise by
        these two characteristics, viz., first that they were not sent by God,
        and secondly that they propagated false doctrine. Now preachers bearing
        a commission from the bishops of the Church are sent by God. St.
        Augustine, in his Epistle to Orosius, interprets the word
        <i>apostle</i> as signifying send. “There are,” he says, “four kinds of
        Apostles. Those sent by God, those sent by God by means of man, those
        sent by man alone, those who are sent by their own inclination. Moses
        was sent by God, Joshua by God and man. They who in our times are raised
        by public favour to the priesthood are sent by man alone. False prophets
        are sent by none; they go forth at their own desire.” The Saint adds:
        “He should be considered as sent by God, who is not chosen out by human
        praise or flattery, but who is recommended by the excellence of his life
        and by the wishes of apostolic priests.” Those who preached heretical
        doctrine were likewise called false apostles. This we know by the
        testimony both of St. Paul and of the Gloss, on his words. When the
        Apostle writes (Gal. i. 16): “Only there are some that trouble you and
        would pervert the gospel of Christ,” the Gloss comments: “These were the
        false apostles who said that the Gospel was opposed to the law of
        Moses.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Again, on the words, “There shall arise false Christs and false
        prophets” (Mark xiii. 22), the Gloss says: This verse is to be
        understood as referring the heretics who attacked the Church, declaring
        that they were Christs. The first of these impostors was Simon Magus;
        the last will be Antichrist.” He who preaches without, any commission to
        do so, or teaches false doctrine, does so inspired by some bad motive,
        either of covetousness, or pride, or vain glory. Such men are deprived
        of the grace of God; and consequently commit sins, more or less heinous.
        But everyone who preaches for the sake of gain or popularity is not,
        necessarily a false apostle or false prophet; otherwise there would be
        no distinction between a hireling and a false apostle. They who preach
        for the sake of anything save of the glory of God and the good of souls
        are hirelings; let their preaching be true or false, authorised or
        unauthorised. But such men cannot be called false prophets, unless they
        either bear no commission, or teach false doctrine. In the same way,
        every sinner who administers the sacraments, or preaches the Word of
        God, is not necessarily a false apostle or a false prophet. For true
        prelates are true apostles; although at times they may be sinful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus, the detractors of religious who call them false prophets or false
        apostles are, by their own words, convicted of folly or malice. For the
        fact that religious may be guilty of sins more or less heinous, such as
        seeking their own glorification, taking vengeance on their enemies, and
        the like, cannot make them false prophets or false apostles, provided
        that they bear a commission to preach, and that they teach true
        doctrine, The enemies of religious do not presume to question the
        orthodoxy of their preaching. To the arguments against the right of
        religious to preach, we have already fully replied. It remains then for
        us to say that those who accuse religious of being false apostles or
        false prophets are themselves guilty of falsehood. They may, with the
        same deceitfulness, accuse others of the same crime. The fact that false
        apostles have done many things which other sinners and even just men
        have done, is no reason for calling those other men false apostles also.
        We have, however, already shown the fallacy of such an argument.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        WE must now examine the grounds on which religious are accounted
        responsible for all the evils which have ever overtaken the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The enemies of religious accuse them of being wolves and robbers,
        because, they say, they enter the fold (ie. by preaching, and hearing
        confessions) by a door which is not the legitimate one. By this
        assertion, they prove their own folly. For, as the Gloss reminds us,
        Christ is the door. No prelate is the door; for, as the Gloss adds,
        Christ has reserved this office to Himself. Hence they who do not enter
        the fold by the door are Jews, Gentiles, philosophers, Pharisees and
        heretics, who enter not by Christ; not those who do not enter by means
        of a bishop.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Religious are called thieves, because they are accused of stealing what
        is not their own, by converting the sheep of Christ not to His doctrine,
        but to their own tenets. They are called robbers, because they are
        accused of slaying the sheep which they steal. The words of the Gloss
        are, interpreted in this sense. But, granted that it be justifiable to
        say that those who preach Christ truly, but without permission from a
        bishop, are thieves and robbers, this accusation cannot, as we have
        already shown, be made with regard to religious, unless we hold that a
        bishop or the Pope is not the immediate superior of anyone under the
        jurisdiction of a parish priest.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Religious are likewise termed ravening wolves; because they are said to
        minister to the spiritual needs of the faithful, in order to fatten on
        their material goods, just as wolves devour sheep. In this, they are
        clearly deceived. Our Lord draws a distinction between a wolf and a
        hireling. The vices which the enemies of religious attribute to wolves,
        the Gloss attributes to a hireling: “A hireling is one who seeks what
        belongs to Christ, and who serves God, not for His own sake, but in the
        hope of a reward.” Hence they, whose sole crime is to preach for the
        sake of temporal gain are hirelings. They who physically ill-treat the
        faithful, as do tyrants, or who spiritually scatter them, as do the
        devil and heretics, his ministers, are wolves. This is made dear by the
        words in the Acts of the Apostles (xx. 29), “I know that after my
        departure, ravening wolves will enter in among you.” On this text the
        Gloss says: “These wolves signify heretics, who are insidious, cruel and
        strong in controversy.” Again, the words in the Gospel of St. Matthew
        (vii. 15), “Within they are ravening wolves,” are specially applied by
        the Gloss to heretics, who, “in the malice of their hearts and in their
        desire to injure souls, resemble wolves, whether they pursue the
        faithful by exterior persecution, or deprave them by false teaching.” We
        have already pointed out that it is a rash judgment to assert that a
        man’s chief motive in ministering spiritually to his neighbour is the
        hope of reaping material advantage.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Religious are accused of creeping into houses because they are said to
        hear confessions without permission from the parish priests. Thus they
        creep into men’s consciences. Those who accuse them of so doing quote,
        in support of their opinion, the following words from the Gloss (on 2
        Tim. iii.): “They creep into houses, i.e., they investigate the
        qualities of men, and lead captive those whom they judge fitting
        disciples.” Now priests cannot know the characteristics of men, save by
        confession.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As these words of the Gloss are considered, by the enemies of religious,
        conclusive evidence in support of their accusations, we will examine
        what is the true meaning of this passage. St. Paul foretold that “the
        latter days of the Church would be times of peril, and that there would
        be men, lovers of themselves” etc. “The term <i>latter days</i>,” writes
        St. Augustine to Hesychius, “is sometimes used of the Apostolic times.”
        Thus we read in the prophet Joel (ii. 28): “In the latter days I will
        pour out my spirit.” St. Peter said that this prophecy was fulfilled on
        the day of Pentecost (Acts ii. 16). Sometimes, however, the latter days
        are understood as meaning the Last Day, “I will raise him no at the last
        day” (John vi. 55). In the passage to which reference has been made,
        however, the latter days must be taken to mean the time nearest to the
        Last Day. For the Apostle speaks of the future, when he says: “In the
        last days shall come dangerous times.” These words agree with those that
        we find in the Gospel of St. Matthew (xxiv. 12), “Because iniquity has
        abounded, the charity of many shall grow cold.” The Gloss reminds us of
        the words of St. Paul, “Men shall be lovers of themselves.” These are
        not to be understood as meaning that the vice of self-love or any other
        vice has at any time been absent from the world, but that it will
        increase in proportion as malice increases. There were in the primitive
        Church some men tainted with these vices; otherwise St. Paul would not
        have told Timothy avoid them. And, as if Timothy had asked him, how he
        was to avoid what did not exist, says the Apostle by way of answer. “Of
        this sort are they who creep into houses” (2 Tim. iii.). The vices which
        he mentions in the first place were to exist in years to come; but that
        of creeping into houses was an evil of his own time. He speaks of “they
        who creep,” not of they who will creep, and of “they who lead captive,”
        not of they who “will lead captive.” We are not to suppose that although
        using the present tense, he can have intended his words to be taken in
        the future tense. For, as St. Augustine says, in the same Epistle,
        “there were in the early Church men distinguished by creeping into
        houses.” The words signify men, ensnared by the vices which will
        flourish in the latter days.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This is more expressly shown by the words in the Epistle to Titus (i.
        10): “There are also many disobedient, vain talkers, and seducers;
        especially they who are of the circumcision, who must be reproved, who
        subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy
        lucre’s sake.” By those then who creep into houses,” are meant men who
        cunningly introduce themselves into families and propagate false
        doctrine, or those who insinuate themselves into the consciences of men
        and bind them with the chains of error. Such men St. Paul calls “men
        corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith” (2 Tim. iii).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The expression “reprobate concerning the faith” cannot be understood of
        men who are to appear in the future. St. Paul does not say: “They who
        now creep into houses, will be reprobate concerning the faith.” He
        speaks in the present tense, just as when he says, “these resist the
        truth.” Their folly shall be manifest to all men. The Gloss says, “that
        they shall be made manifest by means of the good,” and it reminds us
        that “these words were verified, especially by St. John, who overcame
        the heretics of the East.” Thus, it is plain that the words of St. Paul
        apply to heretics. Hence even were it true that religious hear
        confessions without any licence from their bishops, the foregoing
        passage from St. Paul would not be applicable to them, unless they can
        be proved to teach heretical doctrine. Hence the whole fabric which has
        been built upon to prove that religious who hear confeasions are
        responsible for the evils which will hereafter come upon the Church,
        falls to the ground.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We have already proved the right of religious to hear confessions; and
        we have seen, also, the benefit which results from their so doing.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        WE will now consider how the enemies of religious attribute to them all
        the evils which will befall the Church in her latter days, by declaring
        that they are the forerunners of Antichrist. They adduce two arguments,
        in support of this proposition. (1) They say that the days of Antichrist
        are at hand. (2) They say that religious are the emissaries of
        Antichrist, because they preach and hear confessions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. They try to prove that the latter days of the world are at hand, by
        the words of St. Paul (1 Cor. x. 11), “These things are written for our
        correction upon whom the ends of the world are come.” They also quote
        the words of St. John (1John. ii. 18), “Little children, it is the last
        hour.” St. Paul writes again (Heb. x. 37): “For yet a little and a very
        little while, and he who is to come will come, and will make no delay.”
        In the Epistle of St. James (v. 9) we read: “Behold the Judge standeth
        before the door.” Those who quote these texts in support of their
        arguments maintain that as so long a time has elapsed since the
        apostolic times, the advent of Antichrist must be imminent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We may, of course, gather from these passages that the time of
        Antichrist is at hand. For Holy Scripture always speaks of time as being
        very short in comparison to eternity. Thus, in St. Paul’s First Epistle
        to the Corinthians (vii 29), we read: “The time is short.” In this
        sense, the interpretation given to these words by our opponents is not
        reprehensible. Nevertheless, the texts which they quote cannot be
        considered as a confirmation of their opinion that the days which are to
        be dreaded in the days of Antichrist are immediately imminent, and that
        they are caused by the religious of our day, into whose conduct (they
        say) it the bishops should make enquiries. It is presumption to
        conclude, from the texts just quoted, that Antichrist is to come within
        some definite period of time, be it seven years, or a hundred, or a
        thousand years. Our Lord said to His disciples, when they asked Him: “It
        is not for you to know” (Acts ii. 7) As St. Augustine writes to
        Hesychius: “If it was not for the disciples to know, much less is it for
        any others.” Again, we read (Matt. xxiv. 36): “Of that day and hour no
        one knows, not even the angels of heaven.” And in the 2nd Epistle to the
        Thessalonians (ii, 2) we read: “We beseech you, brethren... that you not
        be easily moved from your sense... as if the day ofthe Lord were at
        hand.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Augustine says (<i>Epist. ad Hesychium</i>): “You say the Gospel
        tells us that no man knows that day or hour. I tell you, as far as my
        understanding will suffice, that no man can know the month nor the year
        of the coming of the Lord. This seems as if the words had been
        understood to mean that, though none can say in what year the Lord will
        come, it is possible to know in what septet or decade of years his
        coming may be expected.” St. Augustine further says: “Although we cannot
        understand this, I would ask you whether we can know the time of the
        coming of the Lord, so far as to be able to say: He will come within the
        next fifty, or hundred years, or within some period more or less
        extended?” And again: “If you say that you cannot understand, I agree
        with you.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Certain men were condemned in the early days of the Church for
        teaching, as men teach now, that the coming of the Lord was imminent. We
        have this on the authority of St. Jerome (<i>De illustr. viris</i>), and
        of Eusebius, (<i>Ecclesiast. Histor.</i>). No period, either long or
        short, can be determined, in which is to be expected the end of the
        world, or the coming of Christ or of Antichrist. It is for this reason
        that we are told that “the day of the Lord shall come as a thief” (1
        Thes. v. 2), and that as “in the days of Noah they knew not till the
        flood came and took them all away, so also shall the coming of the Son
        of man be” (Matt. xxiv). St. Augustine, in his Epistle to Hesychius,
        speaks of three classes of men who made assertions respecting the coming
        of our Lord. One class expects Him soon; another later; and the third
        declares its ignorance of the time of His coming. This last opinion
        meets with the approbation of St. Augustine, and he censures the
        presumption of the others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Those who say that the second advent is at hand, try to establish the
        following argument. The last age begins with the coming of Christ.
        Foregoing ages have not lasted longer than a thousand years. As then
        much more than a thousand years have elapsed since the coming of Christ,
        His second coming must be shortly expected. This argument is answered by
        St. Augustine (<i>83 Quaest. LX</i>) as follows: “Age is supposed to
        include a time equal to the aggregate of all the periods that have
        elapsed.” He compares this latter time to old age. Then he concludes by
        saying: “It is thus uncertain by what generations the final period of
        time, which begins with the coming of our Lord and is to end with the
        end of the world, is to be counted.” God has chosen, for some wise
        purpose, to keep this hidden. So it is written in the Gospel. St. Paul
        also declares that “the day of the Lord is to come like a thief in the
        night.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Those who believe in the speedy coming of Antichrist, say that his
        appearance is heralded by eight signs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (1) They quote the words of Daniel (vii. 25) concerning Antichrist: “He
        shall think himself able to change times.” That is to say, according to
        the Gloss, “ His pride is so excessive that he strives to alter laws and
        ceremonies.” On account of these words the days of Antichrist are said
        to be at hand, because certain men try to alter the Gospel of Christ
        into another gospel, which they call “eternal.” The Gospel of which they
        speak is a certain <i>Introduction to the books of Joachim</i>, which is
        condemned by the Church. Or else it is the doctrine of Joachim, whereby
        they say the Gospel of Christ is altered. But granted that this
        hypothesis were true, it would be no token of the approach of
        Antichrist. For even in the days of the Apostles, certain men tried to
        alter the Gospel of Christ. Thus St. Paul says (Gal. i. 6): “I wonder
        that you are soon removed from him who called you into the grace of
        Christ, to another Gospel.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (2) The second sign of the coming of Antichrist is supposed to be found
        in the words of the Psalmist (ix. 21): “Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over
        them.” This the Gloss interprets to mean “the Antichrist, the giver of
        an evil law.” As the doctrine which we have already mentioned, which
        they call the law of Antichrist, was promulgated at Paris, it is thought
        to be a sign that Antichrist is at hand. But it is not true to say that
        the doctrine of Joachim, or that which is contained in the
        <i>Introduction to the Gospel of Joachim</i>, however reprehensible it
        may be, is the doctrine which will be preached by Antichrist. For
        Antichrist will proclaim himself to be God. St. Paul says expressly (2
        Thes. ii. 4), “So that he sits in the temple of God, showing himself as
        if he were God.” For if, by the teaching of Antichrist, all false
        doctrine is to be understood, just as all heretics are called
        Antichrists; then, the alleged proof of the speedy coming of Antichrist
        is no proof at all. For from the earliest days of the Church there has
        never been a time in which heretical teaching has not been disseminated.
        “Even now there are many Antichrists” (1 John ii. 18). On these words,
        the Gloss remarks: “All heretics are Antichrists.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (3) The third supposed sign of the coming of Antichrist is found in the
        Book of Daniel (v) and in Isaiah (xxi). We read there the account of the
        hand that wrote Mane, Thecel, Phares on the wall of Babylon. Those who
        believe that Antichrist is at hand, maintain that the same prediction
        which formerly was written up in Babylon is now written in the Church.
        <i>Mane</i> was interpreted to mean, “God has numbered your Kingdom and
        has finished it”; and the Kingdom of Christ is now numbered, for it has
        been foretold that it its to endure a thousand two hundred and seventy
        years. <i>Thecel</i> signified, “You art weighed in the balance and
        found wanting”; and the “Eternal Gospel” is preferred to the Gospel of
        Christ. <i>Phares</i> meant your Kingdom is divided, and is given to the
        Medes and Persians”; and the Kingdom of the Church is now finished and
        given to others. Thus, the writing on the wall signified both the
        destruction of the Church and the ruin of Babylon.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This, however, seems a very foolish idea. St. Augustine tells us (<i
          >18 de Civ. Dei</i
        >) that certain men said that Christianity was to last for three hundred
        and sixty-five years, and that at the end of that time it was to cease
        to exist. Thus, it is no new thing to assign a limit for the duration of
        Christianity, since this was done even before the time of Augustine.
        Hence this is no reason for believing Antichrist to be at hand. St.
        Augustine says likewise (<i>ibid.</i>) that in his time some men
        estimated that four hundred years, others that five hundred, were to
        elapse between the Ascension of Christ and His second coming. Others,
        again, reckoned that this period was to embrace a thousand years. But
        the words of our Lord, “It is not yours to know the times or the
        moments” etc. (Acts i. 7), expose the folly of all such suppositions.
        St. Augustine, furthermore, blames the kind of arguments used in such
        conjectures. He compares them to the hypothesis of some that as there
        were ten plagues of Egypt, so there were to be ten persecutions of the
        Church. He says that such opinions are mere human conjectures,
        established on no foundation of truth. Those who interpret the
        handwriting on the wall as prophetic of the speedy coming of Antichrist,
        show their agreement with the Scripture that they reprobate; because,
        like the Scripture, they say that the beloved Babylon is soon to be
        destroyed. But there is no real similitude. For the handwriting in
        Babylon was divinely displayed, and it was therefore a proof of the
        truth; but the writing, of which these would-be prophets speak, is a
        figment of error, on which no argument can be founded.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        They take their other five signs from the signs of which our Lord speaks
        in the Gospel of St. Matthew as portents of His coming.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (4) The fourth sign is taken from the words recorded in the Gospel of
        St. Matthew (xxiv. 29): “Then shall they put you to death, and you shall
        be hated by all nations for my name’s sake.” This sign is said to be now
        fulfilled. For, as men will not endure correction, they persecute those
        holy ones who reprove them, by hatred, by manifold tribulations, and
        even by death. But, this is no argument at all. For this sort of
        persecution befell the Apostles and the martyrs, as our Lord foretold.
        Hence the fact that the Church suffers persecution at present, is no
        more proof that the second advent is at hand than it was in the
        Apostolic age.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (5) The fifth sign is taken from the following words: “Then shall many
        be scandalised.” This prediction is supposed to be fulfilled, because
        religious are calumniated and men take scandal at that. But this
        interpretation of the text is opposed to that of the Gloss which says:
        “Men shall be scandalised, i.e., they shall fall from the faith, through
        fear of the greatness of the torments inflicted on believers.” Thus this
        prediction was fulfilled at the time of the martyrs. It is nothing new
        for holy men to be spoken ill of by the impious. Even the Apostles were
        told (Matt. v. 11): “ Blessed are you when men revile you, and speak all
        that is evil against you untruly.” We also read in ecclesiastical
        history how tyrants caused faithful Christians to be accused of the
        blackest crimes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (6) The sixth sign is taken from the words: “Many false prophets shall
        arise and shall seduce many.” We are told that this sign is now
        manifested, because certain religious appear who are called false
        prophets, because they commend themselves and for other reasons of the
        same kind. But this interpretation will be seen to be erroneous if we
        compare it with the Gloss on the passage in the Gospel of St. Mark
        (xiii), where false prophets are understood to mean heretics, or those
        who, after the Passion of our Lord and before the destruction of
        Jerusalem, seduced the Jewish nation. We have also already spoken at
        length on the subject of false prophets.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (7) The seventh sign is taken from the words: “Because iniquity has
        abounded, the charity of many shall grow cold.” It is maintained that we
        now see the accomplishment of this prediction; inasmuch as those who
        seem to be the most zealous defenders of the Church, forsake the Gospel
        of Christ, and adhere to the “Eternal Gospel”, whereby they show that
        the love which they owe to Christ has grown cold. But this statement is
        untrue. For those about whom it is made have not abandoned the Gospel of
        Christ, and do not profess to believe in any other Gospel. But, granted
        that the accusation were true, there have been in all ages men in the
        Church who appeared perfect, and yet originated heresies. We may mention
        Pelagius, Nestorius, and Eutyches. There have also been many others of
        the same description. But they did not, therefore, prove that their
        charity had grown cold. For, although they did not follow the teaching
        of the Gospel, they did not persecute it. There is no need of
        persecution, where there is no defender of the truth. Such a persecution
        would revive extinct errors; and, under pretext of refuting them, would
        teach them to the people; and this is the greatest of dangers. Hence St.
        Gregory says (<i>14 Moral.</i>) that after Eutyches had died leaving no
        followers, he would not labour to exterminate his errors, lest he should
        again fan them into flame.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        (8) The eighth sign is taken from the words: This gospel of ‘the
        Kingdom, shall be preached in the whole world.” These words are said to
        be fulfilled in themselves, because they proclaim the signs and dangers
        which they wish all men to avoid, according to the words of St. Paul (2
        Tim. iv. 2): “Preach the word, be instant in season, out of season.” We
        are told that those who do not preach these signs are false apostles,
        who have not, like the animals mentioned in the fourth chapter of the
        Apocalypse, “eyes before and behind,” to know both the future and the
        past. But this sign is worth nothing. Even in the early ages of the
        Church, there were, as ecclesiastical history relates, many who
        proclaimed similar prophecies, and who were on this account reproved by
        other Catholics of weight. The Gloss on the words, “Many shall come in
        my name” (Mark xiii) says: “Many, at a time when ruin was imminent,
        came, proclaiming themselves to be Christs and falsely declaring that
        freedom was at hand. And many in the Church, even in the Apostolic ages,
        threatened the faithful with the speedy coming of the Lord.” Hence they
        who foretell these signs are not numbered among those who proclaim the
        Gospel, but among those who seduce many. Consequently, when our Lord
        said, “this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached,” He referred not to
        the preaching of these vain signs, but to the teaching of the Christian
        faith which, before His second advent, will be disseminated throughout
        the whole world. Hence as St. Augustine proves, in his letter to
        Hesychius, the day of the Lord could not in his time be at hand, since
        there still existed nations to which the Gospel had not, as yet, been
        preached. Those who proclaim this sign, themselves fall into the snare
        which they have prepared for others. For they call a certain new
        doctrine, “the Gospel of the Kingdom,” and affirm themselves to be the
        signs which announce the Gospel of the Kingdom. St. Augustine sums up
        the folly and worthlessness of these five last signs, in the following
        words: “Perchance, if we diligently compare and examine all that the
        three Evangelists have said of the coming of Christ, we shall find that
        it points to His daily advent in His body the Church, of which coming He
        said: ‘A little while and you shall see the Son of man coming, or
        sitting’.” (<i>Epist. ad Hesych.</i>).

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As the enemies of religious speak much about the dangers which will
        befall the Church in her latter days, by the instrumentality of those
        whom they call the emissaries of Antichrist, we will now examine what
        means they use in order to ascertain who these emissaries of Antichrist
        will be. They assert that these seducers will be neither barbarians, nor
        Jews, nor Gentiles. But this opinion is contrary to the prophecy of the
        Apocalypse: “Satan... shall seduce the nations which are over the four
        quarters of the Earth, Gog and Magog” (Rev. xx. 7). On these words, the
        Gloss says: “Satan will first seduce these two nations; he will then
        proceed to deceive others.” Or, according to another interpretation, by
        Magog is understood all persecutors who proceeded, at first by secret,
        and afterwards, by open persecution. Hence barbarians are not excluded
        from the persecution of Antichrist, as they would persuade us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But those who affirm that the emissaries of Antichrist will be neither
        Jews, nor Gentiles, are of opinion that they will be Christians, on
        account of the words of St. Paul: “Having an appearance indeed of
        godliness” (2 Tim. iii. 5), i.e., as the Gloss explains, “of the
        Christian religion.” They hold that the words of the Apostle apply to
        those by whose instrumentality evil is to befall the Church in the
        latter days. But, in this assumption they make a great mistake. For St.
        Paul did not mean that the same men would be guilty of all the vices
        which he enumerates, but that some of his words would apply to some men,
        and that other parts of his reproof would be true of other persons.
        Hence it is not necessary that all those who are likely to endanger the
        Church should present an appearance of piety. It is merely implied that
        some of them will do so. In like manner, the early Church suffered
        persecution from believers and unbelievers alike. “In perils from the
        Gentiles... in perils from false brethren” (2 Cor. xi. 26).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The emissaries of Antichrist, we are next told, will not be found among
        the manifestly wicked. This opinion is, however, clearly opposed to the
        82nd Psalm. The Gloss explains that the whole of that Psalm treats of
        the persecution of Antichrist. It adds that among his other emissaries,
        the “ Philistines “ signify those who are drunk with worldly luxury. St.
        Gregory likewise (<i>20 Moral.</i>), expounding the words of Job xxx.,
        “Now I am turned into their song,” says: “These are the words of the
        Church in her latter days, when oppressed by her enemies.” Job says in
        the same chapter: “The strength of whose hands was to me as nothing, and
        they were thought unworthy of life.” St. Gregory interprets the passages
        which follow of those who led manifestly evil and carnal lives.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is maintained that the ministers of Antichrist will be found among
        those who seem to be good men. The proof of this assertion is supposed
        to exist in the words of Our Lord: “Take heed of false prophets” (Mat.
        vii. 14) and by other texts of the same nature. But, although some of
        the emissaries of Antichrist may wear an appearance of piety, it is not
        necessary that they shall all seem godly. Christians of the early Church
        were persecuted both by the impious and by the apparently pious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The argument that no one can lead another astray unless he wear an
        appearance of virtue is untrue. For many more are misled by the
        pleasures of this world and by fear of its sufferings, than by any
        seeming godliness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We are further told that the ministers of Satan will be found among
        those who devote themselves to study. The proof of this opinion is said
        to lie in the words of St. Paul, “ever learning and never coming to a
        knowledge of the truth” (2 Tim. iii, 7). The inapplicability of this
        passage to the point in question is shown by the fact that St. Paul was
        referring not to men who seduce others, but to silly women who suffer
        themselves to be led astray. Granted, however that the words apply to
        men who mislead others, they can only refer to those who, in their
        studies, depart from the way of truth. Hence the text is often
        interpreted of heretics. Those who hold a contrary opinion, however,
        quote in support of it the following words of St. Gregory (<i
          >13 Moral.</i
        >) on Job xvi.: “My enemy has looked at me with terrible eyes.” “The
        incarnate Truth,” says St. Gregory, “chose for His preachers poor and
        simple men. But Antichrist will send as his Apostles men who are cunning
        and double-tongued and imbued with the wisdom of the world.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        St. Gregory explains in another passage, who will be the learned men
        whom Antichrist will send. Commenting on the words of Isaiah (xviii. 2),
        “who sends ambassadors upon the sea, and in vessels of bulrushes upon
        the waters,” St. Gregory says: “He sends his ambassadors upon the sea,
        for he scatters his preachers throughout the world. The ‘vessels of
        bulrushes’ signify the hearts of those who are wise in this world’s
        wisdom. Hence he who sends ambassadors in vessels of bulrushes upon the
        waters makes his preachers depend upon the wisdom of the world, and lead
        their vacillating hearers into sin.” Therefore, the true preachers of
        Antichrist are learned men, who lead worldly lives and attract men to
        vice. But even if Antichrist were going to ruin the Church by means of
        learned men, it would not be by their agency alone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We are further told that the envoys of Antichrist will be found among
        those learned men whose opinion is esteemed as peculiarly weighty and
        valuable. “As if a man should consult God,” it is said of Ahitophel (2
        Sam xvi.). The seducers who will appear in the latter days of the Church
        are supposed to be typified by Ahitophel. For, as Ahitophel adhered
        first to David, and then to Absalom, so they will take part first with
        Christ, and then with Antichrist. St. Paul says of them, first that they
        will have an appearance of godliness, and then that they will be “men
        corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith” (2 Tim iii. 5).
        Stress is also laid on the words, “they came forth from us” (1 John ii.
        19), which means, as the Gloss says, “they shared with us in the
        Sacraments.” But this quotation is no argument. For St. Paul does not
        say of the men to whom he refers that at first they wore an appearance
        of piety, and that then, laying it aside, they became infidels. What he
        means is that while these men had a superficial semblance of godliness,
        they were at the same time infidels at heart. There are many heretics
        who agree with the Church about the Sacraments; and there are some who
        receive the Sacraments, at least exteriorly. Even if, on this account,
        they are typified by Ahitophel, that would not make it necessary for
        them to resemble Ahitophel in the astuteness of his counsels. This
        comparison is purely a figment of the imagination; just as the
        correspondence between the plagues of Egypt and the persecutions of the
        Church, is imaginary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is likewise maintained that the Apostles of Antichrist will be found
        among those who have vowed to obey the counsels. The ground for this
        opinion is supposed to exist in the following passage of St. Gregory.
        Commenting on the words of Job (xxx) “at the right hand of my rising,”
        St. Gregory says: “Calamities shall arise at the right hand of my
        rising. For those who were believed to be chosen members of Christ now
        come forward to persecute the Church.” These words do not, however,
        apply, in any special manner, to those who are under an obligation to
        keep the counsels; for, by the right hand, or the chosen members of
        Christ, all good men are signified. This we know by the following
        passage of St. Gregory (<i>ibid.</i>): “All the faithful of Holy Church
        are spoken of under the name of the right hand.” Even, however, though
        perfect men be understood by the expression “ right hand,” this is no
        proof that the passage we have quoted is especially applicable to
        religious. For men may be perfect in the order of charity, even though
        they be married. Prelates, in like manner, are in state of perfection.
        Hence it is not only religious who are meant by the chosen members of
        Christ. The fallacy contained in this argument makes it easy for us to
        see what underlies the ensuing one. The enemies of religious assert that
        religious are the future emissaries of Antichrist, on account of the
        words: “It will come to pass that Herod will seek the child to destroy,
        him” (Matt. ii. 13). The Gloss comments on this passage thus: “As soon
        as Christ came into the world, persecution arose against Him—a type of
        the future persecution of the Saints.” From this it is argued that, as
        at the coming of our Lord He was opposed by those who seemed to be the
        most wise and holy among men, (i.e. the Scribes and Pharisees), so at
        the end of the world, the faithful of Christ will be attacked by those
        who will seem to be the best and wisest, viz., by leaxned and religious
        men. This argument, however, carries no weight. For, not only the
        Scribes and Pharisees, but the High priests, Annas and Caiphas, and the
        civil rulers, Herod and Pilate, persecuted our Lord. Neither were all
        those who persecuted Him Scribes; for some were only Pharisees. Hence
        this argument does not prove that the future persecutors of the Church
        are to be learned rather than illiterate religious, or religious rather
        than bishops, or religious rather than secular sovereigns and
        dignitaries.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From all the foregoing arguments then they conclude that the heralds of
        Antichrist will be Christians, apparently virtuous, devoted to study,
        strong in giving advice, religious men, bound to the observance of the
        counsels. Thus, although names are not mentioned, the victims of this
        infamous charge are as clearly designated as if they were named. If
        Socrates be the son of Sophroniscus, we mean the same person, whether we
        speak of him as Socrates, or as the son of Sophroniscus. The mode in
        which the accusation is brought against religious is inexcusable; and it
        proves that a personal attack is intended.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We will now refute the calumny point by point:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The first error lies in defining the heralds of Antichrist as one
        race of men, when, as we know by the Gloss on Ps. lxxxii, Antichrists
        will spring from all classes of men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The second error lies in the fact that though diverse authorities may
        be quoted in support of individual points, no class of men furnishes all
        the necessary conditions. The emissaries of Satan who will mislead men
        may, perhaps, exist in great numbers; of which some may be religious,
        some astute in counsel, some learned etc. But perhaps, among all the
        number, not one will be found possessing all these qualifications.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Even were some such men found amongst religious, other such might
        likewise be found among men who are not religious. Hence this argument
        does not tell more against religious than against seculars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. If some religious are to be emissaries of Antichrist, all religious
        will not be his adherents. Perhaps very few religious will join
        Antichrist, as he is to recruit his ranks from all classes of men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5 It is praiseworthy to be a Christian, a learned man, a prudent
        counsellor, and a religious. These
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        attributes, therefore, are no reason for concluding that their possessor
        is to be a forerunner of Antichrist. Rather, if we are to believe our
        Lord’s teaching that “every tree is known by its fruits,” we ought to
        expect good works from good men, and evil deeds from wicked men. Guided
        by this rule, we should look for the future emissaries of Satan among
        bad men.

        WE will now examine how, although the opponents of religious cannot
        affirm that certain works performed by them, such as prayer, fasting,
        and miracles, are evil, they try nevertheless to represent them in a
        false light, and to make them appear suspicious.

        1. Their first contention is that certain bad men, mentioned in the Old
        and in the New Testament, practised these works, in order to disguise
        their wickedness. “Thus it is said that false prophets will come in
        sheep’s clothing” (Matt. vii. 15), “which means,” (says the Gloss),
        “that in the sight of men they will, by their prayers, fastings and
        almsdeeds, resemble the ministers of justice. But their works will avail
        them nothing, but will rather be imputed to them as sin.” Again, on the
        words: “Many will say to me,” the Gloss comments: “We must beware of
        those who work miracles in the name of Christ. Our Lord certainly worked
        them for the sake of unbelievers, but He warned them not to be deceived,
        nor to think that a visible miracle is necessarily visible wisdom.” From
        these words, the enemies of religious conclude that men are not to be
        accepted on account either of their virtues or of their miracles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is, however, easy to see that this opinion is unsound, because it is
        opposed to the words of our Lord (quoted in Matt. v. 16): “Let men see
        your good works, and glorify your Father” etc. Again (Matt. xii) He says
        that “a tree is known by its fruits,” a good tree by its good, and a bad
        tree by its bad fruits. St. Peter likewise says (1 Pet. ii. 12): “Having
        your conversation good among the Gentiles, that whereas they speak
        against you as evil doers, they may, by the good works which they shall
        see in you, glorify God in the day of visitation.” From these words we
        see that good works ought to render a man acceptable to his neighbour.
        In the same way, a man’s miracles render him and his teaching
        commendable. For our Lord says: “For the works which the Father gave me
        to accomplish... give testimony to me” (John v. 36). St. Mark likewise
        says that the Apostles “preached everywhere, the Lord cooperating, with
        them and confirming the word with signs that followed” (Mark xvi. 20).
        These signs were a testimony both to the men and to their doctrine.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We do not, of course, say that bad men may not give signs of virtue; we
        speak only of such things as we are capable of judging. Hence if a man
        show signs of goodness, we naturally conclude that he is good, unless he
        give proofs of wickedness, to show us that the good which he has
        manifested did not proceed from him. The Gloss, commenting on the words,
        “by their fruits you shall know them,” says: “Judge of men not by their
        clothing but by their works.” And again, on the words, “he who eats”
        (Rom. xiv.), the Gloss remarks: “There are certain things, such as
        blasphemy, theft, and the like, which cannot proceed from a virtuous
        soul. It is permissible for us to judge of such matters as these; for
        they come under the category of which Christ spoke saying: ‘By their
        fruits you shall know them.’ But in doubtful matters, let us put the
        most favourable construction on our neighbour’s doings.” Thus the
        authors quoted would have us not to be so deceived by good appearances,
        as to be led away by them into evil or error. But, if anyone who does
        not seek to seduce others into vice or error, he should be judged on
        account of his acts to be a good man. Even if he is in reality wicked,
        this deception is not a dangerous one, for it does not belong to man to
        judge the secrets of the heart. On the words, “Satan himself transforms
        himself into an angel of light” (2 Cor. xi. 14), the Gloss says: “If
        Satan feigns to do or to say something befitting the good angels, and we
        even believe him to be himself a good angel, our error will not be
        harmful or even dangerous. But if the devil begins to tempt us by works
        not his own, we have need of great watchfulness, lest we be led astray.”

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The enemies of religious proceed still further in their malice, and
        declare that the manifest good works done by religious are hypocrisy.
        Thus, they say, religious commit a heinous crime. But, they themselves
        herein resemble the Pharisees, who said to our Lord when He was casting
        out a devil: “By Beelzabub, the prince of devils, He casts out devils”
        (Matt. xii.; Luke xi. 15). They act like the Pharisees who, as soon as
        they see another do a good work, ascribe it to hypocrisy. It was to
        rebuke such judgments that Christ said (Matt. xii. 33): “By their fruits
        you shall know them.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Itis easy to see how much harm such assertions may do. For, if the
        opinion that a man is to be esteemed a hypocrite on account of his good
        works is generally accepted, persons will be withheld from performing
        any acts of virtue; and the same will be the case if everyone is called
        a hypocrite who embraces a state of perfection after committing great
        sins. St. Gregory (<i>31 Moral.</i>) combats this idea. For, commenting
        on the words “she has laboured. in vain, no fear constraining her” (Job
        xxxix.), he writes: “We must remember that our mother the Church nurses
        certain souls in her tender bosom until she brings them to spiritual
        maturity. But, such souls have not as yet acquired the habit of
        holiness, nor are they as yet strong enough to follow the path of
        perfection.” “But,” he continues, “we have no right to call such men
        hypocrites; for weakness is one thing, and malice another.” Thus,
        according to the teaching of St. Gregory, they only deserve to be called
        hypocrites who undertake to perform works of perfection in order thereby
        to cloak their wickedness, and to be able the more easily to injure
        others. Those who, through weakness, may chance to fall into sin, even
        after embracing a life of perfection, are not hypocrites.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now that by the Divine assistance, we have refuted the calumnies of
        malicious men, it becomes evident that there is no condemnation for
        those who are in Christ Jesus who walk, not according to the flesh, but
        who carry the cross of the Lord, repressing earthly desires. Much might
        still be said in confutation of the detractors of religious. But we will
        leave them to the Divine judgment, since the malice of their heart is
        clearly revealed by the speech that falls from their lips. To quote the
        words of Christ (Matt. xii. 34): “How can you speak good things, whereas
        you are evil? Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.” But
        if, as St. Paul says (2 Tim. ii. 21), “anyone cleanses himself from
        these” (i.e. by not consenting to, these malicious judgments), “he shall
        be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord, prepared
        for every good work” (2 Tim. ii.).

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Those, however, who adopt the opinions of these enemies of religious
        will blindly follow the blind, and with them will fall into the ditch.
        But the words which we have spoken will suffice to preserve us from such
        a fate, if they are sanctified by the blessing of God, to whom be honour
        and giving of thanks for ever and ever. Amen.
