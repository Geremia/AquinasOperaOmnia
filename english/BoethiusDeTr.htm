          <b>ST. THOMAS’ INTRODUCTION</b><br />
          <br />
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          “I will seek her out from the beginning of her birth, and bring the
          knowledge of her to light” (Wis. 6:24)
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The natural intuition of the human mind, burdened by the weight of a
          corruptible body, cannot fix its gaze in the prime light of First
          Truth, in which all things are easily knowable; whence it must be
          that, according to the progress of its natural manner of cognition,
          the reason advances from the things that are posterior to those that
          are prior, and from creatures to God. “For the invisible things of
          Him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being
          understood by the things that are made” (Rom. 1:20) and “For by the
          greatness of the beauty and of the creature, the Creator of them may
          be seen, so as to be known thereby” (Wis. 13:5); and this is what is
          said in Job 36:25: “All men see Him, gazing from afar.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          For creatures, through whom God can be known by the natural light of
          reason, are at an infinite distance from Him. But since, in those who
          look at a thing from a great distance, vision may readily be deceived,
          therefore those striving to attain to a knowledge of God from
          creatures fell into many errors: wherefore it is said: “The creatures
          of God are... a snare to the feet of the unwise” (Wis. 14: 11), and:
          “They have failed in their search” (Ps. 63:7); and therefore God has
          provided for the human race another safe road of cognition, bestowing
          upon the minds of men, by faith, a knowledge of Himself. Therefore, it
          is said: “The things also that are of God no man knows, but the Spirit
          of God: but to us God has revealed them by His Spirit” (1 Cor. 2: 11):
          and this is the Spirit by whom we are enabled to be believers: “Having
          the same spirit of faith, as it is written: ‘I believed, for which
          cause I have spoken’ (Ps. 115: 10); we also believe, for which cause
          we speak also” (2 Cor, 4:13)
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Therefore, as the principle of our cognition is naturally the
          knowledge of created things, obtained by means of the senses, so the
          principle of supernatural cognition is that knowledge of First Truth
          conferred upon us, infused by faith; and hence it follows that in
          advancing one proceeds according to a diverse order. For philosophers,
          who follow along the way of natural cognition, place knowledge about
          created things before knowledge about divine things: natural science
          before metaphysics: but among theologians the procedure is in reverse
          order, so that study of the Creator comes before that of creatures.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          This order, therefore, Boethius followed: intending to treat of those
          things which are of faith, he took as the starting point of his study
          that highest origin of things, namely, the Trinity of the one, simple
          God. Whence it is that the above-quoted words are applicable to him:
          “I will seek her out from the beginning of her birth, and bring the
          knowledge of her to light.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In these words, as regards the present opusculum, which he addressed
          to Symmachus, a patrician of Rome, three things can be noted: namely,
          the matter, the mode, and the purpose.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The matter of this work is the Trinity of Persons in the one, divine
          Essence, that Trinity which has its source in the primal nativity in
          which divine wisdom is eternally generated by the Father. “The depths
          were not as yet, and I was already conceived” (Prov. 8:24), and: “This
          day have I begotten you” (Ps. 2:7)
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          This nativity is the beginning of every other nativity, as it is the
          only one involving perfect participation in the nature of the
          generator: but all others are imperfect according as the one generated
          receives either a part of the substance of the generator, or only a
          similitude: from this it follows that from the aforesaid nativity,
          every other is derived by a kind of imitation; and thus: “Of whom all
          paternity in heaven and in earth is named” (Eph. 3: 15); and on this
          account the Son,is called the first-born of every creature (Col. 1:15)
          so that the origin of nativity and its imitation might be designated,
          but not according to the same meaning of generation; and therefore it
          is aptly said: “I will seek her out from the beginning of her birth.”
          “The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways” (Prov. 8:22); for
          not only of creatures is the aforesaid nativity the beginning, but
          even of the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from the Generator and the
          Generated.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But in saying this, he does not say: “I will seek out the beginning of
          nativity,” but “from the beginning” signifies that his search is not
          limited by initiation of this kind of nativity, but that, beginning
          from this, he proceeds to others, for his doctrine is divided into
          three parts. The first part, concerning the Trinity of Persons, from
          the procession of whom every other nativity and procession are
          derived, is contained in that book which we possess at hand, so far as
          anything can be known about the Trinity and Unity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But in another book which he wrote to John, a deacon of the Roman
          Church, we find what he says about the mode of predication which we
          employ in the distinction of Persons and unity of essence; and this
          book begins: “I inquire whether the Father.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The second part, which is about the procession of good creatures from
          a good God, is in a book that is written to the same John (<i
            >De hebdomadibus</i
          >), and this begins: “You ask of me.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The third part is about the separation of creatures through Christ.
          This is divided into two parts: For first, there is set forth the
          faith which Christ taught by which we are justified, in that book
          entitled <i>De fide Christiana</i>, which begins: “The Christian
          faith.” In the second part, an explanation is given of what must be
          held about Christ: namely, how two natures are united in one person.
          This discussion of the two natures and the one person in Christ is
          also in a book written to the same John, which begins: “You, indeed,
          solicitously.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now the mode employed in treating of the Trinity is twofold, as St.
          Augustine says in I <i>De Trinitate</i>, namely, through truths known
          on the basis of authority, and through those known by reason, both of
          which modes Augustine combined, as he himself says.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Some of the holy Fathers, as Ambrose and Hilary, employed but one mode
          of explanation: namely, by setting forth those truths founded upon
          authority. But Boethius chose to proceed according to the other mode;
          namely, according to reasoned arguments, presupposing what had been
          concluded by others on the grounds of authority. Hence also the method
          of his work is indicated in what he says: “I shall investigate”, in
          which an inquiry of reason is signified. In Sirach 39:1 we read:
          “Wisdom,” namely, knowledge of the Trinity; “of all the ancients,”
          that is, which the ancients affirmed solely on the grounds of
          authority; “the wise man will seek out,” that is, he will investigate
          by reason.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Wherefore, in the preface he speaks of “An investigation carried on
          for a very long time.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The purpose of this work is: that hidden things may be made manifest,
          so far as that is possible in this life.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          “They that explain me shall have life everlasting” (Sirach 24:31); and
          therefore, he says: “I will bring the knowledge of her to light” (Wis.
          6:24). “The depths also of rivers he searched, and hidden things he
          brought forth to light” (Job 2 8: 11).

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The problem which has been for so long a time the subject of my
          investigation—to the extent that the divine light has deigned to
          enkindle the feeble spark of my mind—now arranged according to a
          reasoned plan and consigned to writing, I have taken pains to offer
          and share with you, prompted as much by desire for your judgment as by
          zeal for my task.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In this matter it is possible to understand what my intention is
          whenever I entrust my thought to pen, both because of the difficulty
          of the matter and because it is only to you men that I am addressing
          it.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Indeed, I am not prompted by any desire for fame or for empty popular
          applause; but if there is any exterior reward, it can be no other than
          to hope for a judgment in keeping with the matter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          For, wherever I have directed my gaze, apart from you, I have
          encountered, on the one side, stolid indifference or, on the other,
          sly envy, so that I would appear to offer insult to matters pertaining
          to divine things by putting them before such monsters of men to be
          trampled under foot by them rather than to be acknowledged. On this
          account I restrain my pen by brevity, and truths gleaned from the
          deepest teachings of philosophy I veil over by the signification of
          new words, so that they may speak only to me and to you; if you,
          indeed, will direct your attention to them. But, as for others, I so
          disregard them that those who are unable to grasp the meaning of my
          words shall seem unworthy to read them.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Only so much ought one require of me as the intuition of human reason
          can approximate about the sublime truths of the Godhead. For in the
          case of other arts, the same limit is also established, namely, that
          which by the way of reason one can attain. Now, medicine does not
          always effect the cure of the patient. But no blame will be placed
          upon the physician if he has omitted none of the things which he ought
          to have done; and the same is true in other matters.

          Moreover, in proportion to the difficulty of a problem, the pardoning
          of error ought to be the more easily granted. You must also determine
          this: whether the seeds of speculation, gathered from the writings of
          the blessed Augustine, have in my work borne fruit.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now, therefore, let us undertake at this point the discussion of the
          proposed question.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">St. Thomas’ Commentary</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          To this work the author prefixes a preface, in which he does three
          things: First, he briefly indicates the causes of the work, in doing
          which he inclines his hearer to accept what he says. Secondly, he adds
          an excuse or explanation in which he gains the good will of his
          hearer, where he says: “I restrain my pen.” In the third place, he
          points out that the source of his work and, in a certain way, its
          teaching, is the doctrine of St. Augustine, and in doing this he
          renders his hearer attentive, when he says: “You must also determine
          this: whether the seeds of speculation, gathered from the writings of
          blessed Augustine, have in my work borne fruit.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          He likewise sets forth in the first part the four causes of his work.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1) First, the material cause, when he says: “the problem which has
          been for so long a time the subject of my investigation,” that is,
          about the Trinity of Persons of the one God; and in these words he
          implies both the difficulty of the matter, because he has carried on
          the investigation for a very long time, and also the diligence of the
          study with which he has for so long a period investigated it, as
          “investigation” is understood by us, although it can also be
          understood to mean investigation by many; because from the beginning
          of the existence of the Church, this question has especially continued
          to challenge the cleverest minds of Christians.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2) Secondly, he indicates the proximate or secondary efficient cause
          when he says: “the feeble spark of my mind.” Moreover, he speaks also
          of the first or principal cause when he adds: “that the divine light
          has deigned to enkindle.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now the proximate cause of this investigation is, indeed, the
          intellect of the author, which is rightly termed a spark. “For fire,”
          as Dionysius says (XV <i>Coel. hier.</i>), “especially serves to
          signify properties of the divinity: at once by reason of its subtlety,
          of its light, and also by reason of its place and motion.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          These things, in the highest degree, pertain to God, in whom exist the
          culmination of simplicity and of immateriality, perfect charity,
          almighty power, and highest majesty.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          To the angels, “fire” (as indicative of intellect) may be applied in a
          middle sense, but to human minds, with only a more restricted meaning;
          for by union with a body, its purity is lessened, its light is
          obscured, its power weakened, and its upward motion retarded:
          wherefore the efficacy of the human mind is rightly compared to a
          spark.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Hence it would not be able to investigate the truth of this question
          unless light were cast upon it by the divine light; and thus the
          divine light is the principal cause; but the human mind, a cause in
          the secondary order.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3) Thirdly, he treats of the formal cause when he says: “arranged
          according to a reasoned plan,” and he indicates the mode of treatment
          under three headings.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          a) First, since he proceeds by argumentation, he therefore says,
          “arranged according to a reasoned plan.” For a question discussed even
          over a long period according to probable reasons but still with doubt
          is, as it were, without form, not yet laying claim to the certitude of
          truth; and hence it is said to possess form when reasonable proof is
          added, through which certitude regarding the truth may be attained: in
          this process, intellect gives us vision of the truth, because what we
          believe, we owe to authority; but what we understand, we owe to
          reason, as Augustine says.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          b) In the second place he discusses the mode of treatment, since he
          treats of this matter not only in words, but has incorporated it in
          writing, he says: “I entrust my thought to pen.” In so doing, he has
          made provision against the weaknesses of memory.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          c) Thirdly, since he has written, not after the manner of one
          imparting doctrine to another present with him, but as to one absent,
          by means of a letter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Thus Aristotle also composed his books in different ways: some
          addressed to those who in his presence listened to him, and these
          books are called <i>Auditus</i>, as one such book is, entitled,
          <i>De naturali auditu</i>; but certain others he wrote to those
          absent, as we find in I <i>Ethic</i>. that the books
          <i>De anima</i> were so written, where the names of discourses
          addressed to those at a distance are given, as the Greek commentator
          says.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Accordingly, he adds: “I have taken pains to offer and share with you,
          prompted by desire for your judgment,” as if addressing an expert and
          asking his opinion in this matter. Thus, he continues: “prompted as
          much by desire for your judgment as by zeal for my task.” Because he
          had been zealous for ascertaining the truth, he had ordered the
          aforesaid question according to reasonable arguments; and, because he
          was desirous of the judgment of Symmachus, he presented to him the
          work thus arranged in orderly fashion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4) In the fourth place, he refers to the final cause when he says:
          “What my intention is,” that is, what end I am striving for in regard
          to the above-mentioned problem: “Whenever I entrust my thought to pen”
          concerning the aforesaid or certain other matters, “it is possible to
          understand” for two reasons: “because of the difficulty of the matter”
          and also, “because it is only to you men that I am addressing it.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          This book, therefore, he has not written in order to read it to the
          many, which would be with hope of popular acclaim, but rather, for one
          wise man alone; wherefore, he continues: “I am not prompted by any
          desire for fame or for empty popular applause,” as are the poets who
          recite their verses before the foolish crowds in the theater, because
          such applause is often altogether without reason. Thus he puts aside
          any unworthy end and establishes one that is honorable, implying a
          principal purpose, which is interior, namely, knowledge of divine
          truth, and, explicitly pointing out a secondary end, that is, the
          judgment of a wise man, when he says: “If there is any exterior
          reward,” as if he would say: It is an interior reward that principally
          urges me on, but if there is any that is exterior, this can be none
          other than to wait and to hope for a judgment like to the matter, that
          is, proportionate to it: By way of exterior return I ask for nothing
          except what is fitting in a matter of such importance, in regard to
          which I have stated that a judgment of it should be neither stolidly
          indifferent nor the bitter one of an envious critic, but only that
          pronounced in good will by a wise man. Accordingly, he adds: “Wherever
          I have directed my gaze apart from you, that is, to whomsoever I have
          looked, except to you alone, I have encountered on the one side,
          stolid indifference”; that is, lack of comprehension, “on the other
          side, sly envy,” that is, ill will, sly only in condemnation, so that
          he who treated of these things, would seem to offer insult to divine
          treatises, that is, by inordinately explaining them “to such monsters
          of men.” Men are called monsters who, though in human body, bear
          within them the heart of a beast, since vice has made them like to
          beasts in their affections; hence these things “would be trampled
          under foot by them, rather than acknowledged,” because they do not so
          much seek to know, but—because of their envy—to revile whatever is
          said; wherefore, “Give not what is holy to dogs, neither cast your
          pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet” (Matt.
          7:6). Therefore, that I should not do otherwise than this, “I restrain
          my pen by brevity.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          This is the second part of the preface, in which he adds an
          explanation of his manner of writing. And first, he explains the
          difficulty of the task. In the second place, he excuses its
          imperfection. “Only so much ought one require of me as the intuition
          of human reason can approximate about the sublime truths of the
          Godhead. He refers also to a threefold difficulty which purposely he
          attached to it.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The first is by reason of the brevity of his writing; wherefore, he
          says, “I restrain my pen by brevity,” according to that saying of
          Horace: “While I labor to be brief, I become obscure.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The second arises from the subtlety of the reasoning which he
          introduces; thus he says: “truths gleaned from the deepest teachings
          of philosophy,” which are those doctrines abstracted from the senses,
          the principles and conclusions which metaphysics and logic make use
          of.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The third difficulty arises from the newness of the words used;
          wherefore he says: “I veil over by the signification of new words.”
          These words are called “new” either with reference to the matter,
          because others treating of this same question did not employ the same
          vocabulary, or with reference to those who read them, because they are
          unaccustomed to such terms.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          These three difficulties he adds to the fourth which he had previously
          mentioned: that is, the difficulty of the subject; consequently, in
          regard to those things written in this book, the meaning is clear only
          to the wise, to such men as the author himself and the one to whom he
          has addressed it. But others who cannot comprehend it are excluded
          from the reading of it. For things which are not understood are not
          read with pleasure. And because his reason for so writing is connected
          with preceding statements, he introduces it ‘with “therefore,” which
          is a sign of a conclusion. The meaning is clear.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          “Only so much ought one require of me as the intuition of human reason
          can approximate about the sublime truths of the Godhead.” Here he
          excuses a defect of the work, because, indeed, one ought not demand
          from him in this task any more certitude than that which the human
          reason, in mounting up to the divine, is capable of; a position which
          he justifies by reference to matters of less importance in other arts,
          in which only such an end is established for each craftsman as he can
          accomplish, one such as human reason allows. A physician does not
          always, indeed, effect a cure, but if he omits nothing which he ought
          to do, he will be without blame; and the same is true in regard to
          other arts. Therefore in this work, where the matter is difficult,
          going beyond the experience of human nature, the greater leniency
          ought to be granted if he does not solve the question with perfect
          certitude.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Then, when he says: “You must also determine this: whether the seeds
          of speculation, gathered from the writings of the blessed Augustine,
          have in my work borne fruit,” he adduces whose authority he follows in
          his work, namely, Augustine. Not that he says only those things that
          are to be found in the books of Augustine, but because those things
          which Augustine said regarding the Trinity—namely, that the divine
          Persons are equal in an absolute sense and are distinguished according
          to relationships—he accepts as seeds and principles, which he uses in
          resolving this difficult question; and so this explanation of truth by
          means of many considerations of reason is the fruit springing forth
          from those seeds found in the writings of Augustine himself; but
          whether they are acceptable and productive, he leaves to the judgment
          of him to whom he writes, thus coming directly to the proposed
          question.

          Here there occurs a twofold question: concerning the knowledge of
          divine things, and concerning the manifestation of them.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In regard to the first, four things are asked:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          1. Whether the human mind in order to attain to a knowledge of truth
          requires a new illumination of divine light.

          2. Whether it can attain to an idea of God.

          3. Whether God is the first object known by the mind.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Whether the human mind is capable of arriving at a knowledge of the

            >Whether the Human Mind in Order to Attain to a Knowledge of Truth
            Requires a New Illumination of Divine Light</span
          >
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Objections</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It seems that the human mind in attaining to any knowledge whatever
          requires a new illumination of divine light. “Not that we are
          sufficient to think anything of ourselves as of ourselves, but our
          sufficiency is from God” (2 Cor 3:5); but there can be no perception
          of truth of any kind whatever without thought; therefore the human
          mind cannot know any truth unless it is illuminated by a new light
          from God,
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. It is easier to learn any truth from another than to discover it
          for oneself: wherefore, those who know things by their own efforts are
          preferred to those who are able to learn from other men, according to
          I Ethic.; but man is not able to learn from another unless his mind is
          interiorly taught by God, as Augustine says in his book,
          <i>De magistro</i>, and Gregory in <i>Hom. Pentec.</i>; therefore
          neither can anyone discover truth of himself unless his mind is
          illuminated by God with a new light.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. As the eyes of the body are related to corporeal things which they
          behold, so is the intellect related to the intelligible truth which it
          perceives, as is evident in III <i>De anima</i>; but the bodily eye
          cannot see corporeal things unless it is illuminated by the material
          sun; therefore neither can the intellect behold the truth unless it is
          illuminated by the light of the invisible sun, which is God.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Those acts are said to be in us (as our own) for the exercise of
          which we possess within ourselves principles that are sufficient; but
          in us there is not the power to know truth altogether [or absolutely]
          for there are many who labor to learn the truth and who, nevertheless,
          are unable to do so; therefore we have not in us sufficient principles
          for knowing truth and so it must be that to arrive at knowledge of it
          we require aid from outside ourselves, and so the conclusion is like
          the foregoing.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. The operation of the human mind depends more upon the divine light
          than does the operation of sensible or inferior beings upon the light
          of the material heaven; but inferior bodies, although they have forms
          which are principles of their natural operations, are, nevertheless,
          incapable of perfecting these operations unless they are aided by the
          influence of the light of the stars; wherefore Dionysius (<i
            >De div. nom.</i
          >, chap. 4) says that the light of the sun contributes to the
          generation of visible bodies and that it moves them to life and
          nourishes them and causes them to grow; therefore its natural light,
          which is, as it were, its form, would not, suffice to make truth
          visible to the human mind unless another light, namely, the divine,
          supervened to assist it.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. In all causes that are ordered to one another essentially, and not
          accidentally, no effect proceeds from a second cause unless through
          the operation of a first cause, as is established. in the first
          proposition of De causis; but the human mind is ordained beneath the
          uncreated light according to an order that is essential and not
          accidental; therefore the operation of the human mind which is its
          proper effect, namely, the cognition of truth, cannot proceed from it
          unless by reason of the operation of the first uncreated light: its
          operation, however, seems to indicate nothing other than illumination;
          therefore, etc.

          7. As the will is related to willing well, so the intellect is related
          to right understanding: but the will cannot will well unless it is
          aided by divine grace, as Augustine says; therefore neither can the
          intellect know the truth unless illuminated by divine light.

          8. That for which our powers do not suffice is wrongly ascribed to our
          strength: but it is reprehensible that anyone should ascribe knowledge
          of the truth to his own ability, since indeed we are even commanded to
          ascribe it to God, according to this saying of Sirach 51:23: “To Him
          that giveth me wisdom, will I give glory”; therefore our powers do not
          suffice for knowledge of truth, and so the conclusion is as before.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Sed contra.</span> The human mind is
          divinely illuminated by its natural light, according to the saying of
          Psalm 4:7: “The light of Your countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us.”
          Thus, therefore, if this created light is not sufficient for the
          knowing of truth, but there is required a new illumination, according
          to the same reasoning this superadded light would not suffice either,
          but wiluld require still another light, and so on to infinity, which
          cannot be encompassed; and so it would be impossible to know any
          truth. Therefore one must stand firm in reliance upon the first light,
          namely, that the mind by its natural light, without the superaddition
          of any other, can see the truth.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, as it suffices for what is actually visible that it should he
          proportionate to the sight in order to move it, so it suffices for
          what is intelligible that it should be proportionate to the intellect
          in order to move it: but our mind possesses within itself the power of
          making things intelligible in act, namely, the active intellect, and
          what is intelligible is proportionate to it; therefore it does not
          require another new illumination in order to know truth.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, as corporeal light is related to bodily vision, so is the
          intellect related to intelligible vision. But any corporeal light at
          all, even though it is weak, renders something corporeally visible, at
          least itself; therefore, the light of the intellect also, which is
          connatural to the mind, suffices for the understanding of some truth.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Furthermore, all things that are artificially made depend upon the
          cognition of some truth since the principle of them is knowledge; but
          it is certain that products of art do exist in which, according to
          Augustine, the free will is able [to act] by itself, as in building
          houses and the like; therefore man is sufficiently capable of knowing
          some truth without a new divine illumination.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> It must be said that
          between potencies that are active and those that are passive there is
          this difference: passive potencies cannot enter on the act of their
          proper operation unless they are moved to do so by their own active
          agents, just as the senses experience no sensation unless moved by
          some sensible object; but active potencies are capable of operation
          without being moved by another, as is evident in the case of the
          potencies of the vegetative soul: but as regards the intellect, a
          twofold potency is found, an active potency, that is, the active
          intellect, and a passive potency, that is, the possible intellect.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now, there are certain philosophers who maintained that the possible
          intellect alone is a faculty of the soul, while the active intellect
          is a separate substance; and this is the opinion of Avicenna.
          According to this opinion, it follows that the human soul would not be
          capable of entering upon its proper operation, which is knowledge,
          unless illuminated by an exterior light, namely, by the light of that
          separate substance which they call the active intellect.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But because the words of the Philosopher (III <i>De anima</i>) seem to
          proclaim more convincingly that the active intellect is a potency
          belonging to the soul—and with this the authority of Scripture agrees,
          which declares that we are distinguished by that intellectual light to
          which the Philosopher compares the active intellect—therefore it is
          held that there is in the soul, fitting it for intelligible operation,
          that is, for undertaking the cognition of truth, a potency which is
          active and another which is passive. Wherefore, as some powers which
          are naturally active, when conjoined with those which are their
          passive complements, suffice for the carrying on of their natural
          operations, so also the soul of man, having in itself an active and a
          passive potency, is sufficient for perception of the truth.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Since, however, the power of any created thing is but finite, its
          efficacy will be limited to certain determined effects. Consequently
          it cannot attain to certain other effects unless new power is added to
          it; but there are some intelligible truths to which the efficacy of
          the active intellect does extend, as, for example, those first
          principles which man naturally knows, and those truths which are
          deduced from them; and for such knowledge no new light of intelligence
          is required, but the light with which the mind is naturally endowed
          suffices.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But there are other truths to which the aforesaid first principles do
          not extend; e.g., the truths of faith and things that exceed the
          faculty of reason, such as knowledge of future contingent events, and
          the like; and such things the human mind cannot know unless it is
          divinely illuminated by a new light, superadded to that which it
          naturally possesses.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          For, although it does not require the addition of new light for
          knowledge of those things to which reason naturally extends, it does
          require divine operation: for over and above that operation by which
          God created the natures of thingsgiving to each its proper form and
          ability, by which they are able to exercise their proper operation. He
          also operates in things the works of Providence, directing and moving
          the capabilities of all things to their proper acts. For in this way
          the whole universe of creatures is subject to the divine governance,
          as instruments are subject to the direction of the workman and as
          natural qualities are subject to the power of the nutritive soul, as
          is said in II <i>De anima</i>. Therefore, as the work of digestion is
          accompanied by a natural heat, according to the measure which the
          digestive function imposes upon heat, and as all the inferior powers
          of the body operate according as they are directed and moved by virtue
          of the heavenly bodies, so all the active created powers are governed
          and moved by the Creator.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Thus, therefore, in all cognition of truth, the human mind requires
          the divine operation. In the realm of naturally known truths, however,
          it requires no new light, but only the divine motion and direction;
          for the knowledge of other (supernatural) truths it needs also a new
          illumination. And because it is of such things that Boethius speaks,
          he says: “To the extent that the divine light has deigned to enkindle
          the feeble spark of my mind.”

          1. Although we are in no way sufficient of ourselves, as from
          ourselves, to know anything without the operation of God, yet it is
          not necessary that for every operation of ours a new light should be
          given to us.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. In matters of natural cognition God teaches us interiorly in this
          way: that He is the cause of the natural light which is in us, and He
          directs it to the truth; but in other (supernatural) matters He
          further teaches us by the infusion of a new light.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. The eye of the body, when illuminated by the light of the material
          sun, does not respond to a light which is in any way natural (i.e.,
          intrinsic) to itself, by means of which it makes things to be actually
          visible; even as is the case with the mind when it is illuminated by
          the uncreated Light; and therefore the eye always requires an exterior
          light, but not the mind.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Where there is pure light of intellect, as in the angels, it
          makes,evident without difficulty all things known in the natural
          order, so that in them there is cognition of all objects naturally
          intelligible to them: in us, however, this light is obscure, being
          overshadowed as it were by reason of conjunction with the body and
          with corporeal powers, and on this account it ii hindered so that it
          cannot freely and naturally behold that truth which is itself
          knowable, as is said in the Book of Wisdom (9:15): “For the
          corruptible body is a load upon the soul; and the earthly habitation
          presseth down the mind that museth upon many things.” From this it
          follows that on account of the impediment (of the body) it is not in
          our power to know truth altogether in its fullness. But each one
          possesses more or less the power to know in proportion to the purity
          of the intellectual light which is in him.

          5. Although inferior bodies have need of superior bodies for their
          operation, to the extent that they must be moved by them;
          nevertheless, for the perfect accomplishment of their proper
          functions, they do not need to receive from these superior bodies any
          new forms, And in like manner it is not necessary that the human mind,
          which is moved by God, should be endowed with any new light in order
          to understand those things which are within its natural field of
          knowledge.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. As Augustine says (VIII <i>Super Gen. ad litteram</i>), as the air
          is illuminated by the presence of light, but straightway grows dark if
          the light should be removed, so the mind is illuminated by God, and so
          also it is God who continually causes the natural light in the soul,
          not one kind now and another kind at another time, but the same
          (natural light); for He is the cause not only of its coming to be, but
          of its continued existence in us. In this way, therefore, God
          continually operates in the mind since He causes and governs the
          natural light in it, and thus the mind does not carry on its own
          function without the operation of the First Cause.

          7. The will never can will the good without divine incitement:
          nevertheless it can will the good without infusion of grace, though
          not meritoriously. And likewise the intellect, without divine
          influence, is incapable of knowing any truth whatever; it can,
          however, know without infusion of new light, though not those truths
          which exceed natural cognition.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          8. From the very fact that God causes the natural light in us by
          conserving it and directing it to seeing, it is manifest that
          perception of the truth must be ascribed principally to Him, just as
          the producing of a work of art is ascribed to the artist rather than
          to the thing produced.

          1. It seems that in no way can God be known,by us. For that which in
          the highest degree of our knowledge remains unknown to us, in no
          manner is knowable: but in the most perfect degree of our cognition we
          are not united with God, except as with One who is, as it were,
          unknown, as Dionysius says (<i>Theologia mystica</i>, chap. 1);
          therefore God is in no way knowable by us.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Anything that is known is known through some other form; but, as
          Augustine says, God escapes (by transcending) every form of our
          intellect; therefore in no way is He knowable by us.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Between the knower and the thing known must be some kind of
          proportion, as in the case of any potency and its object; but between
          our intellect and God there can be no proportion, as there can be none
          between the infinite and the finite; therefore our intellect can in no
          way know God.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Since potency and act are reduced to the same genus, inasmuch.as
          they divide all classes of being, no potency can be in act which is
          outside its own genus: just as the senses are incapable of knowing
          intelligible substance; but God is outside every genus; therefore He
          cannot be known by any intellect that is in a genus; but our intellect
          is of this kind.therefore, etc.

          5. If that which stands first is done away with, everything consequent
          upon it is likewise put aside: but what is first intelligible about a
          thing is its quiddity; hence that which a thing is, is said to be the
          proper object of the intellect (III <i>De anima</i>); and what is
          serves as a medium of demonstrating whether it exists, and all the
          other conditions of the thing. But concerning God, we are unable to
          know what He is, as Damascene says. Therefore, we can know nothing of
          God.

          But on the contrary is the saying of Rom. 1:20: “For the invisible
          things of Him, from the creation of the worla, are clearly seen, being

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Nothing is loved unless it is known, as is evident from Augustine (II
          <i>De Trinitate</i>); but we are commanded to love God; therefore we
          are capable of knowing Him, since the impossible is not enjoined by
          precept.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer: It must be
          said that there is a twofold way in which anything is known. One
          manner is through its proper form, as the eye sees a stone through the
          species of the stone. Another way is through some other form similar
          to it, as a cause is known through the similitude of its effect, just
          as man is known through the form of his image.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, through its own form a thing is also known in two ways. One
          way is the following: when knowledge is through the form which is the
          thing itself, as with God who eternally knows His own essence, and as
          an angel knows itself. According to another mode, knowledge is through
          a form which is other than the thing: either when the form has been
          abstracted from a thing—in which case the form is more immaterial than
          the thing itself, as is the form of a stone abstracted from the stone
          itself— or when the form is impressed on the intellect by a thing, as
          occurs when the thing is more immaterial than the similitude by which
          it is known; thus, as Avicenna says, we know intellectual beings
          through their impression in us.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Therefore, since our intellect has, in our present state of wayfaring,
          a determined relation to forms abstracted from sensible things (since
          it is dependent upon phantasms in the same way as sight is upon
          colors, as is said in III <i>De anima</i>), it cannot know God in this
          life through that form which is His essence; though it is in this way
          that He is known by the blessed in heaven.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          No similitude, however, of whatever kind impressed by Him upon the
          human intellect, would suffice to make His essence known, since He
          infinitely transcends every created form; consequently God cannot be
          made accessible to the mind through created forms, as Augustine says.
          Nor, in this present state, can God become known to us even through
          the species of things which are purely intelligible, which have in a
          certain way a likeness to Him, because our intellect is connaturally
          related to phantasms, as has been said. Therefore it remains certain
          that it is only through the forms of His effects that He is known.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          There are, moreover, two kinds of effects: those which adequate the
          power of a cause, and through such an effect the power of a cause is
          fully known, and consequently the essence of the cause; and another
          kind of effect which is not completely equal to its cause. Through
          this latter kind of effect it is not possible to comprehend the power
          of the agent, and consequently not its essence either; but regarding
          the cause it can be known only that it exists. Thus the knowledge of
          an effect stands as a principle whereby the existence of its cause is
          known, just as does the quiddity of the cause when it is known through
          its own form. Now, it is according to this second mode that every
          effect stands in relation to God; and hence we are not able in this
          life to attain to any knowledge of Him, except that He is.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Nevertheless, of those knowing that He is, one will know Him more
          perfectly than another, because a cause is more perfectly understood
          from its effect the more perfectly the relation of the cause to its
          effect is apprehended. And in this relation of an effect not reaching
          in equality to its cause, three things are noted: namely, the
          progression of the effect from its cause; secondly, the consequent
          similitude of the effect to its cause; and thirdly, the failure on the
          part of the effect to attairt to a perfect likeness of its cause. Thus
          the human mind grows in the knowledge of God, even though it cannot
          attain to a knowledge of what He is, but only to a knowledge that He
          is, in three ways.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Thus, in the first place, God is known as His productiveness and
          efficacy are more perfectly known. Secondly inasmuch as He is known as
          the Cause of the nobler of His effects, since ihose creatures which
          display being of a higher mode in their resemblance to Him manifest
          His eminence more than others. In the third place, He is better
          recognized as differenhated from all those things which appear in His
          effects.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Hence, in <i>De divinis nominibus</i>, Dionysius says that God is
          known inasmuch as He is the cause of all things, by His transcending
          eminence in comparison to all things, and by denial (of all created
          imperfection).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, in the attempt to arrive at some knowledge of God, the human
          mind is greatly assisted when its natural light is fortified by a new
          illumination: namely, the light of faith and that of the gifts of
          wisdom and of understanding, by which the mind is elevated above
          itself in contemplation, inasmuch as it knows God to be above anything
          which it naturally apprehends. But because even this new light does
          not suffice to penetrate to a vision of His essence, it is said to be,
          in a certain way, turned back upon itself by His excellent light; and
          this is what is said in Gregory’s gloss regarding the statement in
          Gen. 32:30 (“I have seen God face to face”): “When the vision of the
          soul is directed to God, it is reflected back upon itself, overwhelmed
          by the brilliance of His immensity.”

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It is answered: God as an unknown is said to be the terminus of our
          knowledge in the following respect: that the mind is found to be most
          perfectly in possession of knowledge of God when it is recognized that
          His essence is above everything that the mind is capable of
          apprehending in this life; and thus, although what He is remains
          unknown, yet it is known that He is.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. It may be said: From the fact that the divine essence escapes any
          form of our intellect, evidently it is not possible to know what He
          is, but only that He exists.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. It is answered: Proportion is nothing other than the mutual
          relation of two things associated by something in respect to which
          they either agree or differ. Now, agreement may be of two kinds.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In one way, things may be associated as belonging to the same genus of
          quantity or quality, as is the relation of one surface to another or
          of one number to another inasmuch as one excels the other or is equal
          to it, or even as heat is related to heat; and according to this mode
          of relation there is no possible proportion between God and creature,
          since there is no agreement in any genus.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In another way beings are said to be related when they are associated
          in a certain order; and in this way there is proportion between matter
          and form, between the maker and the thing made. This also is the kind
          of proportion required between knower and knowable, since what is
          knowable is, in a certain way, the act of the knowing power. Such,
          too, is the proportion of a creature to God: that of caused to its
          cause, and of knower to the knowable; but according as the excellence
          of the Creator transcends the creature, there is no proportion of the
          creature to the Creator which makes it possible to receive from Him an
          influx proportionate to His complete power, or to know Him perfectly,
          even as He perfectly knows Himself.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. It may be said: The intellect and the intedligible object are of
          one genus, as potency and act. God, however, although not in the genus
          of intelligible things, as if comprehended under a genus participating
          in its nature, nevertheless is related to this genus as its principle.
          For His effects are not outside every genus of intelligible beings;
          wherefore even here, He can be known through His effects, and in
          heaven, through His essence. Moreover, a thing seems to be called
          “intelligible” more by negation than by, affirmation; for a thing is
          said to be intelligible inasmuch as it is either immune from matter or
          separated from it. Hence, negations may be stated in regard to divine
          things with truth; though affirmations are inadequate in expressing
          agreement, as Dionysius says (<i>Coel. hier.</i>, chap. 2).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It may be answered: When a thing is known, not through its own
          form, but through an effect, the form of that effect takes the place
          of the form of the thing itself, and therefore from the effect it is
          possible to know whether the cause exists.

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It seems that the first object known or perceived by the mind must
          be God Himself. For, that in which all other things are known and
          through which we form judgments of what we know from all other things,
          is the first thing known by us, just as light is known by the eye
          prior to what is seen by the light; and as principles are understood
          before conclusions: but all things are known in the First Truth, and
          through that Truth we judge of all things, as Augustine says in
          <i>De Trinitate</i> and in <i>De vera religione</i>; therefore the
          First Truth is first known by us.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. When there are many ordered causes, the influx of the first cause
          into the thing caused is prior to that of the second cause, and it is
          the last to leave the effect, as is said in Liber de causis: but since
          human knowledge is caused by things, the knowable or the intelligible
          is the cause of the mind’s intellection; therefore the first
          intelligible is the first to influence it: but the influence of the
          intelligible on the mind, as such ‘ is that it be understood;
          therefore God is the first object known by our intellect, since He is
          the first intelligible.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. In all cognition, in which those things that are prior and simpler
          are first known, what is first and simplest is known first: but in
          human cognition. those things that are first experienced are things
          prior to others and simpler, as is evident, since being is that of
          which first the human mind forms a concept, as Avicenna says; being,
          moreover, is first among created things; therefore also, God first
          comes to the knowledge of the human mind, since He is absolutely first
          and most simple being.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. That end which is the last in attainment is the first in intention:
          but God is the last end of the human will, to whom all other ends are
          ordained; and He is, therefore, the first in intention. But this could
          not be unless He were known; therefore God must be the first object of
          kliowledge.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. That which requires no preliminary preparation in order to be
          fitted to the need of the workman is the first chosen for his task,
          rather than that which needs some labor in order to be made ready,
          just as one making a bench selects wood already cut rather than uncut
          wood: but sensible things need to be abstracted from matter by the
          active intellect befctre they can be understood by the possible
          intellect. God, on the other hand, is by His very nature altogether
          separate from matter: therefore He is understood by the possible
          intellect prior to sensible things.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. Those things that are naturally known, and that cannot be thought
          of as non-existing, are what first occur to our cognition: but an idea
          of the existence of God is naturally implanted in all minds, as
          Damascene says. Neither is it possible to think of God as
          non-existent, as Anselm states; therefore God is the first being known
          by us.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Sed contra</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          On the contrary, according to the Philosopher, everything known by us
          takes its origin from sense knowledge: but God is absolutely remote
          from sense experience; therefore He is not first known by us, but is
          known last.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, according to the Philosopher, those things that are posterior,
          according to nature, are first known as far as we are concerned; and
          those things which are less knowable in themselves are better known as
          far as we are concerned. But created things are posterior and less
          knowable by nature than is God Himself; therefore, by us, He is known
          after creatures.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, what is promised as an ultimate reward does not come first,
          preceding everything done to deserve it: but knowledge of God is
          promised to us as the ultimate reward of all cognition and action;
          therefore God is not the first object known by us.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer that it must
          be said: There are those who declare that the first object known by
          the human mind even in this life is God Himself, who is first truth
          and the one through whom all other things are known. But this is
          evidently false, since to know God through His essence constitutes the
          beatitude of man; wherefore it would follow that every man would be
          blessed.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, since in the divine essence all things said of it are one,
          no one would err in regard to anything he said concerning God—a thing
          which from experience is evidently false; furthermore, since things
          first in the comprehension of the intellect ought to be most certainly
          known, the intellect would be certain that it knew them; but it is
          clear that this is not the case in the proposition (as to knowing
          God).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          This position is also repugnant to the authority of Scripture (Exod.
          33:20): “Man shall not see Me and live.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Hence there are others who say that the divine essence is not the
          first thing known by us in this life, but the influx of its light is,
          and in this way God is the first object known by us.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But this claim cannot be held; for the first influx of divine light in
          the mind is the natural light by which the power of intellectual life
          is constituted. This light, however, is not at first known by the
          mind; neither by cognition by which is known what this light is, since
          much investigation is required to know the essence of the intellect;
          nor by cognition by which is known whether such a light exists; for we
          do not perceive that we possess intellect, except inasmuch as we
          perceive that we understand, as is clear from the Philosopher’s words
          in IX <i>Ethic</i>. For no one knows that he understands anything,
          save inasmuch as he understands something intelligible. From this it
          is evident that cognition of an intelligible object-precedes cognition
          by which one knows that he himself understands, and consequently
          precedes the cognition by which he knows that he possesses an
          intellect; and so the influx of the natural light of intelligence
          cannot be the first thing known by us; and much less can any other
          kind of influx of light be the first thing known. Therefore it must be
          said that “the first thing known to man” is a phrase which can be
          understood in two ways: either according to the order of diverse
          potencies, or according to the order of objects in some one potency.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          According to the first way, since all the knowledge of our intellect
          is derived from sense experience, what is made known to us by our
          senses is known prior to what is known by the intellect; and this is
          the singular, or the sensibleintelligible.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          According to the other meaning, that is, according to the order of
          objects in any one potency, the proper object of each potency is what
          is first knowable by it. Since, however, in the human intellect there
          is an active potency and a passive one, the object of the passive
          potency, namely, the possible intellect, will be that which is in act
          through the active potency, that is, through the active intellect,
          since to the passive potency there must correspond that which
          activates it.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The active intellect, however, does not render intelligible separate
          forms, which are of themselves intelligible, but those forms which it
          abstracts from phantasms; and hence forms of this I er kind are those
          which our intellect knows. And amongese forms, the ones that first
          come to be abstracted by the intellect hold the place of priority.
          These, furthermore, are the forms that comprehend more notes—either
          after the manner of a total universal or after the manner of an
          integral whole—therefore the more universal things are first known to
          the intellect; a composite is known before its component parts, and a
          definition before the parts of the definition.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In this respect there is a certain imitation of the intellect found in
          the sense powers, which also receive as their objects things which in
          a certain way are abstracted from matter. For even in the case of the
          senses, singular things of a more general nature are the first known,
          as “this body” is known sooner than “this animal.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Thus it is evident that God and other separate substances cannot in
          any way be the first objects of our intellection, but are understood
          from other things, as is said in Rom. 1:20: “For the invisible things
          of Him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being
          understood by the things that are made.”

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to objections</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It may be said: From the words of Augustine and from other similar
          sayings, it is not to be understood thai the uncreated truth itself is
          the proximate principle by which we know and judge of things, but that
          through the light conferred upon us, which is a similitude of that
          truth, we have cognition and judgment. Nor would this light have any
          efficacy except from the First Light: just as in methods of
          demonstration second principles would have no certitude unless founded
          upon the truth of first principles. Nevertheless it should not be
          thought that even this (natural) light is the first thing known by us.
          For we do not know other things by means of it, as if it were a medium
          for cognition of the knowable, but because (as agent) it makes other
          things knowable. Wherefore it could not itself be known unless it were
          contained among knowable things; even as light could not be seen by
          the eye unless manifested in color itself.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. It may be answered: In the case of a plurality of ordered causes,
          the influx into the ultimate effect is not always of the same nature.
          Therefore it need not be that the first intelligible so influence our
          intellect as to be Himself an object of our knowledge; but it is only
          necessary that as cause He bestow the power of intellection. Or it may
          be said that although in the order of intelligible things God is first
          absolutely, yet He is not first in the order of things that are
          intelligible to us.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. It may be said: Although those things which are first in the genus
          of things abstracted by the intellect from phantasms are first known
          by us, as ens and unum, nevertheless it does not follow that those
          which are first absolutely (simpliciter), which are not contained in
          the genus of any proper object, should be classed with the former
          [i.e., things abstracted from phantasms].
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Answer is made: Although God is the last end in attainment and
          first in the intention of the natural appetancy, it is not necessary
          that He be first in the cognition of the human mind, which is ordained
          to its end, but first in the mind of the One ordaining it, as is the
          case in other things which by natural appetancy tend toward their own
          end. Nevertheless, the end is known from the beginning and intended in
          a certain general way, inasmuch as the mind desires its own well-being
          and welfare, which is possible to it only on condition that it
          (ultimately) possess God.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It may be answered: Although a process of abstraction is not
          required for the understanding of separate substances, they are not
          intelligible through the light of the active intellect; wherefore they
          are not the first objects of knowledge as far as our intellect is
          concerned.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. It may be said: The existence of God, considered in itself, is a
          thing knowable in itself, since His essence is His existence; and in
          this way Anselm stated the matter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Nevertheless, to us, who do not behold His essence, it is not
          self-evident that He exists; though cognition of it may be said to be
          innate inasmuch as it is through principles which are innate in us
          that we are easily able to perceive that God exists.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It appears that the human mind is sufficiently capable of attaining
          to a knowledge of the divine Trinity through natural reason. Whatever
          belongs to being inasmuch as it is being ought especially to be found
          in first being: but a trinity does belong to being inasmuch as it is
          being, since such is found in everything, in this way: that all things
          have species, mode, and order, as Augustine says; therefore it is
          possible to know by natural reason that in God there is a Trinity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. No perfection can be wanting in God: but three is the number of
          every perfect thing, as is said in I <i>De coelo et mundo</i>:
          therefore Trinity must be attributed to God, and thus the conclusion
          is like that of the previous argument.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. All inequality is reducible to prior equality, as multitude is
          reducible to unity: but between God and first created being there is
          inequality; there must, therefore, be some preceding equality, but
          this could be no other than that of a plurality; therefore there must
          be some plurality in the Divine Being.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Anything that is equivocal is reducible to what is univocal: but
          the issuing forth of creatures from God isequivocal; it is needful,
          therefore, to presume as prior to it a univocal procession, by which
          God proceeds from God, by reason of which a Trinity of persons ensues.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. Without companionship, there can be no joy in the possession of any
          good: but in God there is from all eternity a most joyful possession
          of good; therefore, He possesses eternal companionship; but this could
          be no other than the companionship of divine persons, since no
          creature is eternal. Therefore, it is necessary to suppose a plurality
          of persons in the Deity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. It is possible to know from natural reason that God is intelligent;
          but from the fact that He is intelligent it follows that He conceives
          the Word, since this is common to every intelligence; therefore by
          natural reason it is possible to know of the generation of the Son
          and, in the same way, of the procession of love (between Father and
          Son: the Holy Spirit).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. Richard of St. Victor in his <i>De Trinitate</i> says: “I believe
          without any doubt that in the case of whatever things are necessary
          there cannot be wanting reasons to explain them, not only probable
          arguments, but necessary ones”; but that God is three and one is a
          necessary truth, since He is eternal; therefore in proof of this there
          are necessary arguments of reason, and so the conclusion is as the
          previous one.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          8. The Platonists had no knowledge of God except through reason: but
          they held that there were at least two persons: namely, the Father and
          the Mind generated by the Father, and this Mind contained the ideas of
          all things—a truth which we claim in regard to the Son; therefore by
          natural reason a plurality of persons can be known.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          9. The Philosopher at the beginning of <i>De coelo et mundo</i> says:
          “Through this same number (three) we ourselves are accustomed to call
          upon God the Creator”; and so the conclusion is the same.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          10. In this life we can in no way know what God is but only that He
          is: but there is a way in which we know that God is three and one,
          since we know it by faith; therefore this truth does not pertain to a
          quidditative knowledge of God, but only to an entitative knowledge.
          But by natural reason we can know God entitatively; therefore it is
          possible by natural reason to know that God is three and one.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Sed contra</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Faith is of things that are not apparent to reason, as is clear from
          Heb. 11:1; but that God is three and one is an article of faith;
          therefore reason does not suffice for knowing this.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, natural reason has its efficacy from first principles of
          natural cognition: but that God is three and one cannot be deduced
          from principles naturally known, for these are derived from sense
          experience, and in sensible things there is found nothing like to
          three supposita of one essence; therefore God cannot be known as three
          and one from reason.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, according to the words of Ambrose: “It is impossible for
          anyone to know the secret of generation; the mind fails; the voice is
          silent; not only mine, but even that of the angels”; therefore natural
          reason does not suffice for knowledge of divine generation, and
          consequently for knowledge of the Trinity of persons.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer that the
          truth that God is three and one is altogether a matter of faith; and
          in no way can it be demonstratively proved. For, although certain
          reasons can be found (by way of demonstration <i>ad hoc</i>), they are
          not necessary, or even very probable except to one who believes it.
          This is evident from the fact that in this life we know God only from
          His effects, as previous statements have proved. Hence, according to
          natural cognition, we can know nothing of God except what we can
          derive concerning Him from viewing the relationship of effects to Him.
          Thus there are things that designate His causality and His eminence
          over creatures and that deny in Him any of the imperfections found in
          effects. The existence of a Trinity of persons, however, cannot be
          perceived from a consideration of divine causality, since causality is
          common to the whole Trinity. Nor can it be known from His lacking any
          imperfection. Therefore in no way can it be demonstratively proved
          that God is three and one.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to objections</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It may be said: Those things which are many among created beings
          are in fact one in God: and therefore, although in every creature
          there is found a certain kind of trinity, it cannot be necessarily
          concluded from this that there is such a trinity in God, except
          logically, and this kind of plurality is not sufficient to prove a
          distinction of persons.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. It may be answered: The perfection of the number three is found in
          God according even to the unity of His essence, not because His
          essence is subject to numeration, but because in it there is contained
          virtually the perfection of every number, as is said in the
          <i>Arithmetica</i> of Boethius.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. It may be said: Apart from any distinction of persons, there is
          equality in the Divinity, inasmuch as Its wisdom is equal to Its
          power. Or it can be said that in regard to equality there are two
          points of consideration, namely, plurality of supposita, among whom
          equality exists, and unity of quantity, which is the cause of
          equality. The reduction of inequality to equality, therefore, does not
          occur by reason of the plurality of supposita, but by reason of the
          cause; for just as unity is the cause of equality, so inequality is
          the cause of plurality. Hence it must be that the cause of equality
          precedes the cause of inequality, but not that any kind of inequality
          is preceded by some kind of equality: otherwise it would be necessary
          in an order of numbers that there should be something before unity and
          duality, which are unequals; or that in unity itself there should be
          found plurality.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. It must be said: Although anything equivocal is reducible to what
          is univocal, it is not necessary that equivocal generation should be
          reduced to univocal generation, but that it should be reduced to a
          generator which is univocal in itself. Now, in natural things we see
          that equivocal generations are prior to univocal because equivocal
          causes have an influx extending to the total species, whereas univocal
          causes have not, their influence extending only to one individual; and
          thus they are quasi-instruments of equivocal causes, just as inferior
          bodies are of superior.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It is answered: It is not possible for man to have a joyous life
          without companionship because he has not within himself that which
          makes him all-sufficient; whereas, for the same reason, animals that
          are self-sufficient require no association with others for
          preservation of life, but are solitaries. God, however, is supremely
          self-sufficient; wherefore, even though there were no distinction of
          persons, infinite joy would still be His.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. It may be said: In God, intellect and object of intellect are the
          same; and therefore, from the fact that He is intelligent, it need not
          be supposed that in Him there is any concept really distinct from
          Himself, as is the case with us: Trinity of persons, however, requires
          real distinction.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. It may be answered: Understanding of this passage is clarified by
          that which follows: “Although they (these truths) are of such kind as
          to escape all our endeavors.” All things that are necessary in
          themselves, therefore, are either known in themselves or are knowable
          through other things: yet not in such a way that they are necessarily
          apparent to us. Therefore we cannot, even as a result of all our
          industry, discover necessary arguments of reason sufficient to prove
          all necessary truths.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          8. It may be said: The position of the Platonists affords no argument
          as regards the truth of this matter, even though it appears to do so
          according to words. For they did not hold that this Mind was of the
          same essence with God the Father, but that it was another substance
          proceeding from the first, and separate; and they also supposed that
          there was a third substance, the Soul-of-the-World, as is evidenced by
          Macrobius. And because all these separate substances they called
          “gods,” it came about that they called upon or spoke of three gods, as
          Augustine says in <i>De civitate Dei</i> (chap. 10); because they did
          not hold that there was anything like to the Holy Ghost, as there was
          to the Father and the Son. For the Soulof-the-World is not the nexus
          of the other two, according to their doctrine, as is the Holy Spirit
          between the Father and the Son; therefore they are said to have lacked
          the third sign, that is, knowledge of the Third Person. Or it may be
          said, as the more common explanation has it, that they knew two
          persons according to the things appropriated to power and wisdom, but
          not according to the things proper to them. But goodness, which is
          appropriated to the Holy Spirit especially, has as its effects things
          which they did not know.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          9. It may be said: Aristotle did not have any intention of saying that
          God should be worshiped as three in one, but that He was honored by
          the ancients by the number three in their sacrifices and prayers
          because of the perfection of three as a number.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          10. It may be answered: All things in God are of one, simple essence;
          but those things that in Him are one, are many in our intellem, and on
          this account our intellect can apprehend one of these things without
          the other. Therefore in this life we are able to understand the
          quiddity of none of these things, but only their existence; and thus
          it happens that one of them may be known to exist and not another:
          just as one might know that there is ‘ wisdom in God, but not know
          that there is also omnipotence; and likewise it is possible, by
          natural reason to know that God exists, but not that He is a Trinity,
          and one God.

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It seems that it is not permissible to investigate divine things by
          the arguments of reason. In Sirach 3:22, it is said: “Seek not the
          things that are too high for thee”; but divine truths are, in a
          special way, too high for man, and particularly those truths which are
          of faith; therefore it is not permissible to inquire into them.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Punishment is not inflicted except for some fault; but, as it is
          said in Prov. 25:27, “He that is a searcher of majesty shall be
          overwhelmed by glory”; therefore, it is not right to search out those
          things which pertain to divine majesty.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Ambrose says: “Abandon arguments where faith is sought.” But in
          regard to divine truths, especially those concerned with the Trinity,
          faith is required; therefore in this matter it is not permissible to
          inquire into truth by arguments of reason.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Ambrose, in speaking of divine generation, says: “Supernal
          mysteries are not to be scrutinized: one may know that the Son was
          begotten; but how He was begotten should not be analyzed.”
          Accordingly, for the same reason it is not permissible to make
          rational investigation of those truths which pertain to the Trinity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. Gregory in his Homily for Easter (chap. 8) says: “Faith has no
          merit where human reason affords proof”; but it is wrong to lose the
          merit of faith; therefore it is not right to investigate matters of
          faith according to methods of reason.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. All honor ought to be given to God: but divine mysteries are
          honored by silence; wherefore Dionysius says at the close of Coel.
          hier.: “Honoring by silence the hidden truth which is above us”; and
          with this there agrees what is said in Psalm 64, according to the text
          of Jerome: “Praise grows silent before You, O God,” that is, silence
          itself is Your praise, O God; therefore we ought to refrain ourselves
          in silence from searching into divine truths.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. No one is moved to infinity, as the Philosopher says in I
          <i>De Coelo et mundo</i>, because all motion is on account of the
          attaining of an end [terminus], which is not to be found in infinity;
          but God is infinitely distant from us. Since, therefore, investigation
          is a kind of motion of reason toward that which is being searched out,
          it appears that divine truths ought not to be investigated.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          On the other hand, it is said (1 Pet. 3:15): “Being ready always to
          satisfy everyone that asketh you a reason of that (faith and) hope
          which is in you”; but this could not be done unless we inquired
          reasonably into those things which are matters of faith; therefore
          investigation according to methods of reason into the truths of faith
          is necessary.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again as is said in Titus 1:9, it pertains to a bishop that he be
          capable of exhorting in sound doctrine and of overcoming those
          contradicting it: but he cannot do this without use of argumentation;
          therefore one ought to employ the arguments of reason in matters of
          faith.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again Augustine says in I <i>De Trinitate</i>: “With the help of God
          our Lord, we shall begin to discuss according to reason that for which
          they [our adversaries] seek explanation: that the Trinity is one God.”
          Therefore man can inquire about the Trinity according to methods of
          reason.

          Also Augustine says in his argument against Felician: “Since without
          too much disagreement you recognize these two things—since you do not
          disregard the foregoing argument and the word of authority—I present
          the matter to follow in spch a way that you yourself may accept it as
          proof”; that is, I shall make use of arguments from reason and
          authority; and thus the conclusion is like the previous one.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer that it must
          be said that, since the perfection of man consists in his union with
          God, it is right that man, by all the means which are in his power and
          in so far as he is able, mount up to and strive to attain to divine
          truths, so that his intellect may take delight in contemplation and
          his reason in the investigation of things of God, according to the
          saying of Ps. 72:28, “It is good for me to adhere to my God.” Hence
          also the Philosopher in X <i>Ethic.</i> opposes the saying of those
          who maintained that man ought not concern himself about divine things,
          but only about such as are human, saying: “One ought to be wise in
          regard to man, however, not according to those treating of human
          affairs alone, as a mortal knowing only mortal things; but, inasmuch
          as it is fitting for a mortal man to do so, he ought to do all things
          according to the best of those powers that are in him.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In a threefold manner, however, it is possible for man to err on this
          point:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          First, by presumption, since one might enter upon such investigation
          as if he could attain a perfect comprehension, and it is this kind of
          presumption that is denounced in Job 11:7: “Do you think you can
          comprehend the steps of God, and find out the Almighty perfectly?” And
          Hilary says: “Do not involve yourself in the hiddenness and mystery of
          this inconceivable nativity; do not overwhelm yourself, presuming to
          comprehend the loftiest of intelligible things, but understand that it
          is incomprehensible.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In the second place, error arises if, in matters of faith, reason has
          precedence of faith and not faith of reason, to the point that one
          would be willing to believe only what he could know by reason, when
          the converse ought to be the case: wherefore Hilary says: “While
          believing [in a spirit of faith], inquire, discuss, carry through your
          speculation.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In a third way error results from undertaking an inquiry into divine
          things which are beyond one’s capacity. Wherefore it is said in Rom.
          12:3, “Not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise, but to be wise
          unto sobriety and according as God hath divided to every one the
          measure of faith.” All men, indeed, have not been accorded the same
          measure; wherefore a thing is beyond the capacity of one which is not
          beyond that of another.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to objections</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It may be said: Those things are said to be too high for man which
          exceed his capacity, no those things which are of greater dignity
          according to nature: for the more man fixes his gaze upon things
          loftier by na ture, in accordance with his capacity, the more it is to
          his advantage; but in the consideration of things which in the least
          exceed his capacity, he easily falls into error. Therefore the gloss
          on this same passage says: “Heretics are produced in two ways: namely,
          when men, beyond their proper capacity entering upon inquiry
          concerning the Creator or creatures fall into errors and depart from
          the truth.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Answer may be made: To search out is, as it were, to press one’s
          investigation to the very end; but this would be unlawful and
          presumptuous if one should so investigate divine truths as though he
          could attain to complete comprehension as his goal.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. It is answered: Where faith is sought for, those arguments which
          are in opposition to faith and those which seek to have precedence
          over it are cast aside, but not those which in due manner follow it.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. It may be said: It is not lawful in this world to inquire into
          divine mysteries in such a way that one would have the intention of
          comprehending them, as is evident from the words that follow: “It is
          lawful to know that He was begotten,” etc. For he undertakes an
          unlawful mode of inquiry who seeks to know what the nature of this
          nativity is, since in regard to divine things we are able to know what
          they are not, but not what they are.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It may be answered: Human reasoning may be spoken of in two ways:
          in one way, it may be regarded as demonstrative, forcing the intellect
          to believe; and this kind of reasoning cannot be possessed in regard
          to those truths which are of faith; but it is possible to possess this
          kind of reasoning in refuting those arguments which would destroy
          faith or assert the impossible. For, although reason cannot
          demonstrate those things which are of faith, neither can these same
          truths be demonstratively disproved. Moreover, if this kind of reason
          could lead ta a proving of those things which are of faith, it would
          deprive man of the merit of faith, because then assent would not be
          voluntary, but necessary.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Persuasive reasoning, however, derived from certain likenesses to
          those things which are set forth by faith does not void the meaning of
          faith, since it does not make these truths to be apparent, for there
          can be no resolution of them to those first principles discernable by
          the intellect. Nor does it take away the merit of faith, because it
          does not force the intellect to comprehend truth, but assent remains
          voluntary.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. It may be said: God is honored by silence, but not in such a way
          that we may say nothing of Him or make no inquiries about Him, but,
          inasmuch as we understand that we lack ability to comprehend Him.
          Wherefore in Sirach 43: 32-34, “Glorify the Lord as much as ever you
          can, for He will yet far exceed, and His magnificence is wonderful.
          Blessing the Lord, exalt Him as much as you can: for He is above all
          praise. When you exalt Him put forth all your strength, and be not
          weary: for you can never go far enough.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. Answer may be made: Since God is infinitely distant from creatures,
          no creature is so moved unto God as to be made His equal, either in
          receiving from Him or in knowing Him. Therefore, by reason of the fact
          that God is infinitely distant from creatures, there is no terminus to
          the motion of creatures; but every creature is moved to this: that he
          may be more and more like to God, so far as this is possible, and so
          also the human mind ought always be moved more and more to a knowledge
          of God, according to the measure that is proper to it. Therefore
          Hilary says: “He who in pious spirit undertakes the infinite, even
          though he can in no wise attain it, nevertheless profits by
          advancing.”

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. it appears that there can be no science of those divine truths
          which are matters of faith. For wisdom is distinguished from science;
          but wisdom treats of divine truths; therefore science cannot do so.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. As is said in I <i>Poster.</i>, in every science one must suppose a
          quidditative knowledge of the subject; but in regard to God, it is
          impossible for us to know in any way what He is, as Damascene says;
          therefore it is not possible to possess any science of God.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. It pertains to every science to consider the parts and passive
          potencies of its subject; but, since God is simple form [absolute
          act], He has not any parts that can be distinguished, nor in Him can
          there be any passive potencies; therefore there can be no science
          about God.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. In any science, reason precedes assent, for it is demonstration
          which in the sciences makes one assent to what is knowable; but in
          regard to those truths which are of faith, the converse ought to
          prevail, namely, assent on account of faith ought to precede reason,
          as has been said; therefore, of divine truths, especially of those
          which are known by faith, there can be no science.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. Every science proceeds from self-evident principles which every man
          accepts upon first hearing, or from principles in which he has faith
          because of those first principles; but the articles of faith which are
          first principles in matters of faith, are not principles of this same
          kind, since they are not <i>per se nota</i> nor can they be resolved
          by demonstration to those that are, as has been said; therefore, there
          can be no science of divine truths held by faith.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. Faith is not of those things that are apparent: but science is of
          things that are apparent, because through science those things that
          are treated of come to be clearly seen; therefore, concerning divine
          truths that are held by faith there can be no science.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. Understanding is the principle of every science, because from the
          intellection of principles one comes to scientific knowledge of
          conclusions: but in those things that are of faith, intellection is
          not the beginning, but the end, for, as is said in Is. 7:9, “If you
          will not believe, you shall not understand”; therefore there can be no
          science of divine truths held by faith.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But on the contrary is what Augustine says in XII <i>De Trinitate</i>:
          “To that science only do I attribute any value by which faith is well
          served, which leads to, produces, defends, and strengthens happiness”;
          therefore there is a science of the truths of faith.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Also, Wis. 10:10: “She gave him the science of the saints”, that is,
          of the truths of faith, because no other science can be here meant
          except that by which saints are distinguished from sinners, which is
          the science of faith.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Also the Apostle in speaking of the knowledge of the faithfu says in 1
          Cor. 8:7: “But there is not knowledge in everyone,” and thus we come
          to the same conclusion as before.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer that, since
          the essence of science consists in this, that from things known a
          knowledge of things previously unknown is derived, and this may occur
          in relation to divine truths, evidently there can be a science of
          divine things.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But knowledge of divine truths can be thought of in two ways. In one
          way, as on our part, such truths are not knowable except from created
          things, of which we have a knowledge derived from sense experience. In
          another way, on the part of the nature of these things themselves,
          they are, in themselves, most knowable; and although they are not
          known by us according to their essences, they are known by God and by
          the blessed according to their proper mode; and so science of divine
          things must be considered in a twofold manner. One is according to our
          mode of knowledge, in which knowledge of sensible things serves as the
          principle for coming to a knowledge of divine; and it was in this way
          that the philosophers handed down a traditional science of divine
          things, calling first philosophy a divine science. The other mode is
          according to that of divine things themselves as they are understood
          in themselves. This is, indeed, a mode of knowledge which we cannot
          possess perfectly in this life; but there is for us, even in this
          life, a certain participation and assimilation to such a cognition of
          divine truth, inasmuch as through the faith which is infused into our
          souls we adhere to the very First Truth on account of Itself. And as
          God, since He knows Himself, knows in a way that is His own, that is,
          by simple intuition, not by discursive thought, so we, from those
          truths that we possess in adhering to First Truth, come to a knowledge
          of other truths, according to our own mode of cognition, namely, by
          proceeding from principles to conclusions. Wherefore, those truths
          that we hold in the first place by faith are for us, as it were, first
          principles in this science, and the other truths to which we attain
          are quasi-conclusions. From this it is evident that this science is of
          a higher order than that which the philosophers traditionally termed
          divine, since it proceeds from higher principles.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to objections</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It may be said: Wisdom is not distinguished from science as opposed
          to it, but as related to science by adding to it. For wisdom is,
          indeed, as the Philosopher says in VI <i>Ethic.</i>, the head of all
          the sciences, regulating all others inasmuch as it treats of highest
          principles: on this account it is also called “the goddess of
          sciences” in I <i>Metaph.</i>; and much more is this true of that
          wisdom which is not only about highest principles, but from highest
          principles. Moreover, the function of wisdom is to order, and
          therefore this highest science, which orders and rules all others, is
          called wisdom; just as in mechanical arts we call those men wise who
          direct others, as the architects: but the name of “science” is also
          left to others that are inferior, and accordingly science is
          distinguished from wisdom as a property from a definition (i.e., as
          properties flow necessarily from an essence, so do the other sciences
          from wisdom).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. It may be said: As has been previously declared, since causes are
          known through their effects, the knowledge of an effect substitutes
          for the quidditative knowledge of the cause; this is necessarily
          required in those sciences treating of things that cannot be known
          through themselves: thus, for us to have a science of divine things,
          it is not necessary that we first have a quidditative knowledge of
          God. Or, again, it can be said that what we know God is not, takes the
          place, in divine science, of a cognition of what He is: for as one
          thing is distinguished from others by what it is, so God is here known
          by,that which He is not.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. It may be answered: In science the parts of a subject are not to be
          understood only as subjective or integral parts; but the parts of a
          subject are all those things of which knowledge is required in order
          to have cognition of the subject, since all things of this sort are
          not dealt with in a co-science except inasmuch as they are related to
          the subject. Those also are called passive potencies which can be
          proved in regard to anything, whether they are negations or relations
          to other things. And many such things can be proved in regard to God,
          both from naturally known principles and from principles of faith.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. It may be answered: In any science whatever there are certain
          things that serve as principles, and others as conclusions. Hence the
          reasoning process set forth in the sciences precedes the assent given
          to a conclusion, but follows upon assent to principles, since it
          proceeds from them. Now, it is true that the articles of faith are in
          this science rather principles aian conclusions, but they must be
          defended against those opposing them, as the Philosopher (IV
          <i>Metaph.</i>) proves against those denying first principles: for
          they may be made clearer of understanding by certain similitudes, by
          inducing results of opposing naturally known principles, but they
          cannot be proved by demonstrative reasoning.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It must be said: Even in those sciences handed down to us by human
          tradition, there are certain principles in some of them which are not
          universally known, but which presuppose truths derived from a higher
          science, just as in subordinate sciences certain things taken from
          superior sciences are assumed and believed to be true; and truths of
          this kind are not per se nota except in the higher sciences. This is
          the case with the articles of faith; for they are principles of that
          science leading to knowledge of divine things, since those truths
          which are <i>per se nota</i> in the knowledge which God has of
          Himself, are presupposed in our science; and He is believed as the one
          manifesting these truths to us through His messengers, even as the
          doctor believes from the word of the physicist that there are four
          elements.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. Answer is made: The evident truths of a science proceed from the
          evident truth of principles. Wherefore a science does not make clear
          the truth of its principles, but makes clear that of its conclusions:
          and in this same way the science of which we now speak does not make
          evident the things of which we have faith, but on the basis of them,
          it makes other things evident with the same certitude as that
          belonging to their first principles.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. It may be said: Understanding is always the first principle of any
          science, but not always the proximate principle; rather, it is often
          faith which is the proximate principle of a science, as is evident in
          the case of the subordinate sciences; since their conclusions proceed
          from faith in truths accepted on the authority of a superior science
          as from a proximate principle, but from the understanding of
          scientists in the superior field who have intellectual certitude of
          these created truths as from their ultimate principle. So likewise the
          proximate principle of this divine science is faith, but the first
          principle is the divine intellect to the revelation of which we give
          the assent of faith; but faith is in us that we may attain to an
          understanding of those things we believe; in the same way that a
          scientist in an inferior field, if he should gain knowledge of a
          higher, would then possess understanding and science of truths which
          previously were accepted only on faith.

          1. It seems that in regard to those truths that are of faith it is not
          right to employ the rational arguments of the natural philosophers,
          for, according to 1 Cor. 1:17, “Christ sent me not to baptize, but to
          preach the gospel: not kisdom of speech”; that is, “in the doctrine of
          the philosophers,” as the gloss says. And concerning the line (1 Cor.
          1:20), “Where is the disputer of this world?” the gloss says: “The
          disputer is he who searches into the secrets of nature; such men God
          does not accept as preachers.” And on the line (1 Cor. 2:4), “And my
          speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human
          wisdom,” the gloss says: “Although the words were persuasive, they
          were not so because of human wisdom, as is the word of
          pseudo-apostles.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          From all these lines it is evident that in matters of faith it is not
          lawful to employ philosophical reasoning.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. On that line (Is. 15:1), “Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid
          waste,” the gloss says: “Ar, that is, the adversary, namely, secular
          science, which is the adversary of God”; therefore, etc.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Ambrose says: “The deepest mysteries of faith are free from the
          reasonings of the philosophers”; therefore, when a matter of faith is
          dealt with, the reasonings and words of the philosophers ought not to
          be used.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Jerome relates in a letter to Eustochium that in vision he was
          beaten, according to divine justice, because he had read the books of
          Cicero, and that those standing by besought that leniency might be
          granted on account of his youth, and that afterward the extreme
          penalty should be exacted if he read again the books of the Gentiles;
          wherefore, calling upon the name of God, he exclaimed: “If ever I
          shall possess secular books, if ever I read them, I shall have denied
          You”; therefore it is not lawful to use them in treating of divine
          things.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. In Scripture, secular wisdom is often represented by water, but
          divine wisdom by wine. Now, according to Is., chap. 1, the innkeepers
          are upbraided for mixing water with wine; therefore the doctors are
          blameworthy for their mingling of philosophical doctrine with sacred
          Scripture.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. Jerome says, in his gloss on Hosea, chap. 2, “With heretics we
          ought not to have even names in common.” But heretics use the
          arguments of philosophers to destroy faith, as is maintained in the
          gloss on Prov., chap, 7 and Is., chap. 15; therefore Catholics ought
          not to use such in their discussions.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. Every science has its proper principles, and thus also sacred
          doctrine has those that belong to it, namely, the articles of faith;
          but in other sciences the process is not valid if principles are saken
          from a different science, but each ought to proceed from its own
          principles, according to the teaching of the Philosopher (I
          <i>Poster.</i>); therefore the method is not permissible in sacred
          doctrine.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          8. If the doctrine of anyone is repudiated in any respect, the
          authority of his teaching will not be valid in proving anything;
          wherefore Augustine says that, if in sacred doctrine we discover some
          falsity, the authority of that teaching is destroyed for confirming
          anything in regard to faith; but sacred doctrine repudiates the
          doctrine of the philosophers in many ways, because many errors are
          found among them; therefore their authority has no efficacy in proving
          anything (regarding sacred doctrine).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Sed contra</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But on the contrary, the Apostle (Titus 1: 12) makes use of a verse
          from the poet Epimenides, saying, “The Cretans are always liars, evil
          beasts,” etc.; and (1 Cor. 15:33) he employs the words of Menander:
          “Evil communications corrupt good manners”; and in Acts 17:28 are the
          words of Aratus, “For we are also his (i.e., God’s) offspring.”
          Therefore it is licit for other doctors of divine Scripture also to
          make use of the arguments of the philosophers.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, Jerome, in a letter to Magnus, a famous orator of Rome, having
          enumerated many doctors of Scripture, such as Basil and Gregory, adds:
          “All these have so intermingled in their books the teachings and the
          sayings of the philosophers that one knows not which to admire first
          in them, their secular erudition or their knowledge of the
          Scriptures.” But this they would not have done had such been illicit
          or useless.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Also Jerome in a letter to Pammachius about the death of Paula says:
          you have become enamored of the captive woman, secular wisdom, and
          captivated by her beauty, cut her hair and her finger nails, cut away
          the enticement of her tresses and the adornments of her words, bathe
          her with prophetic niter, and, lying with her, say: ‘His left hand
          under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me’ (Cant. 8:3), and
          many children will the captive woman give to you, and from the
          Moabite, Israelites will be born to you.” Therefore with fruitful
          results some make use of secular wisdom.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again Augustine (II <i>De Trinitate</i>) says: “I shall not be without
          zeal in seeking out knowledge of God, whether through Scripture or
          creatures”; but knowledge of God through creaturegis given in
          philosophy; therefore it is not unfitting that in sacred doctrine one
          should make use of philosophical reasoning.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again Augustine (Book II, <i>De doctrina Christiana</i>) says: “If the
          philosophers have by chance uttered truths helpful to our faith, they
          are not only not to be feared, but rather those truths ought to be
          taken from them as from unjust possessors and used to our advantage.”
          Thus the conclusion is as before.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Also on the saying in Dan. 1:8, “But Daniel purposed in his heart,”
          the gloss says: “If anyone ignorant of mathematics should write in
          opposition to the mathematicians, or knowing nothing of philosophy
          should argue against the philosophers, would he not be derided?” But
          doctors of sacred Scripture must at times argue with philosophers;
          therefore it is needful that they make use of philosophy.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer that it must
          be said that gifts of grace are added to those of nature in such a way
          that they do not destroy the latter, but rather perfect them;
          wherefore also the light of faith, which is gratuitously infused into
          our minds, does not destroy the natural light of cognition, which is
          in us by natuise. For although the natural light of the human mind is
          insufficient to reveal those truths revealed by faith, yet it is
          impossible that those things which God has manifested to us by faith
          should be contrary to those which are evident to us by natural
          knowledge. In this case one would necessarily be false: and since both
          kinds of truth are from God, God would be the author of error, a thing
          which is impossible. Rather, since in imperfect things there is found
          some imitation of the perfect, though the image is deficient, in those
          things known by natural reason there are certain similitudes of the
          truths revealed by faith. Now, as sacred doctrine is founded upon the
          light of faith, so philosophy depends upon the light of natural
          reason; wherefore it is impossible that philosophical truths are
          contrary to those that are of faith; but they are deficient as
          compared to them. Nevertheless they incorporate some similitudes of
          those higher truths, and some things that are preparatory for them,
          just as nature is the preamble to grace.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          If, however, anything is found in the teachings of the philosophers
          contrary to faith, this error does not properly belong to philosophy,
          but is due to an abuse of philosophy owing to the insufficiency of
          reason. Therefore also it is possible from the principles of
          philosophy to refute an error of this kind, either by showing it to be
          altogether impossible, or not to be necessary. For just as those
          things which are of faith cannot be demonstratively proved, so certain
          things contrary to them cannot be demonstratively shown to be false,
          but they can be shown not to be necessary.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Thus, in sacred doctrine we are able to make a threefold use of
          philosophy:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. First, to demonstrate those truths that are preambles of faith and
          that have a necessary place in the science of faith. Such are the
          truths about God that can be proved by natural reason—that God exists,
          that God is one; such truths about God or about His creatures, subject
          to philosophical proof, faith presupposes.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Secondly, to give a clearer notion, by certain similitudes, of the
          truths of faith, as Augustine in his book, <i>De Trinitate</i>,
          employed any comparisons taken from the teachings of the philosophers
          to aid understanding of the Trinity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. In the third place, to resist those who speak against the faith,
          either by showing that their statements are false, or by showing that
          they are not necessarily true.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Nevertheless, in the use of philosophy in sacred Scripture, there can
          be a twofold error:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In one way, by using doctrines contrary to faith, which are not truths
          of philosophy, but rather error, or abuse of philosophy, as Origen
          did.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In another way, by using them in such manner as to include under the
          measure of philosophy truths of faith, as if one should be willing to
          believe nothing except what could be held by philosophic reasoning;
          when, on the contrary, philosophy should be subject to the measure of
          faith, according to the saying of the Apostle (2 Cor. 10:5), “Bringing
          into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to objections</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It may be said: From all these words it is shown that philosophical
          doctrine ought not to be used as if it had first place, as if on
          account of it one believed by faith; nevertheless the fact is not
          disproved that doctors of sacred learning may employ philosophy, as it
          were, secondarily. Wherefore, on the saying (1 Cor. 1:19), “I will
          destroy the wisdom of the wise,” the gloss adds: “This he does not say
          because the understanding of truth can be worthy of God’s anger, but
          because the false prudence of those who trusted in their erudition is
          worthy of reproof.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Nevertheless, in order that all that is of faith might be attributed
          not to human power or wisdom but to God, God willed that the primitive
          preaching of the apostles should be in infirmity and simplicity;
          though, on the other hand, with the later advent of power and secular
          wisdom, He manifested by the victory of the faith that the world is
          subject to God as much by wisdom as by power.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. It may be said: Secular wisdom is said to be contrary to God in so
          far as it is an abuse of wisdom (i.e., erroneous) as when heretics
          abuse it, but not in so far as it is true.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. It may be answered: The sacred deposit of the truth of faith is
          said to be free from philosophical doctrine inasmuch as it is not
          confined by the limits of philosophy.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. It may be said: Jerome was so influenced by certain books of the
          Gentiles that he contemned, in a way, sacred Scripture: wherefore he
          himself says: “If I began to read it while turning over the words of
          the Prophets in my own mind, their crude expression filled me with
          distaste.” And no one will deny that such was reprehensible.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It may be said: No conclusive argument can be drawn from figurative
          speech, as the Master (Peter Lombard) says. Dionysius also says in his
          letter to Titus that symbolic theology has no weight of proof,
          especially when such interprets no authority. Nevertheless it can be
          said that When one of two things passes into the nature of another,
          the product is not considered a mixture except when the nature of both
          is altered. Wherefore those who use philosophical doctrines in sacred
          Scripture in such a way as to subject them to the service of faith, do
          not mix water with wine, but change water into wine.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. It may be said: Jerome is speaking of those arguments that were
          invented by heretics to give support to their errors; but such
          doctrines do not belong to philosophy; rather they lead only to error;
          and consequently on their account che truths of philosophy ought not
          be shunned.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. Answer may be made: Sciences which are ordered to one another are
          so related that one can use the principles of another, just as
          posterior sciences can use the principles of prior sciences, whether
          they are superior or inferior: wherefore metaphysics, which is
          superior in dignity to all, uses truths that have been proved in other
          sciences. And in like manner theology—although all other sciences are
          related to it in the order of generation, as serving it and as
          preambles to it—can make use of the principles of all the others, even
          if they are posterior to it in dignity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          8. It may be said: Inasmuch as sacred doctrine makes use of the
          teachings of philosophy for their own sake, it does not accept them on
          account of the authority of those who taught them, but on account of
          the reasonableness of the doctrine; wherefore it accepts truth well
          said and rejects other things: but when it uses these doctrines to
          refute certain errors, it uses them inasmuch as their authority is
          esteemed by those whose refutation is desired, because the testimony
          of an adversary has in that case greater weight.

          1. It seems that in the science of faith divine truths ought not to be
          veiled over by obscurity of words, for it is said in Prov. 14:6, “The
          learning of the wise is easy.” Therefore these truths ought to be
          presented without obscurity of words.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. According to Sirach 4:28, “Hide not thy wisdom in her beauty,” and
          Prov. 11:26, “He that hideth up corn (the gloss says that preaching is
          here meant) shall be cursed among the people.” Therefore the words of
          sacred doctrine ought not to be hidden.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. The text of Matt. 10:27, “That which I tell you in the dark (gloss,
          in mystery) speak ye in the light (gloss, openly).” Therefore the
          obscure truths of faith ought to be made more manifest, rather than
          hidden by the difficulties of words.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. The doctors of truths of faith are debtors to wise and unwise, as
          is evident from Rom. 1:14: therefore they ought so to speak that they
          may be understood by great and small, that is, without obscurity of
          words.
        </p>

          6. Augustine in IV <i>De doctrina Christiana</i> says: “Those
          explaining sacred Scripture ought not to speak in such a way that they
          themselves need explanation as of the same authority; but in all their
          sermons they ought to strive primarily and especially to be
          understood, and to declare these truths with as much clarity as
          possible so that he would be very dull who would not comprehend them.”

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But on the contrary is that which is said in Matt, 7:6, “Give not that
          which is holy to dogs,” on which the gloss comments: “A hidden thing
          is more eagerly sought for, a thing concealed appears more worthy of
          veneration, that which is a long time sought for is held more dear.”
          Since, therefore, sacred writings ought to be regarded with the
          greatest veneration, it seems that it is expedient they be discussed
          with obscurity of speech.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, Dionysius (I <i>Eccles. hier.</i>) says: “Do not reveal to
          another every holy thing in praise of God, except those forms of
          praise generally ordained; that is, those divine rites by which all
          the sacraments are surrounded should not be revealed except to those
          like yourself”; but if they were written in conspicuous words, they
          would be apparent to all; therefore the secrets of faith are to be
          concealed by obscuring words.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Also it is said in Luke 8:10, “To you it is given to know the mystery
          of the kingdom of God” (that is, to have understanding of the
          Scriptures, as is evident from the gloss); “but to the rest in
          parables.” Therefore one ought by obscurity in speech conceal”We
          sacred truths from the multitude.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer that the
          words of a teacher ought to be so moderated that they result to the
          profit and not to the detriment of the one hearing him. Now, there are
          certain things which on being heard harm no one, as are the truths
          which all are held responsible to know: and such ought not to be
          hidden but openly proposed to all. But there are others which, if
          openly presented, cause harm in those hearing them; and this can occur
          for two reasons: in one way, if the secret truths of faith are
          revealed to infidels who oppose the faith and so come to be derided by
          them. On this account it is said in Matt. 7:6, “Give not that which is
          holy to dogs.” And Dionysius (II <i>Coel. hierar.</i>) says, “Listen
          reverently to these words, to this doctrine given for our instruction
          by the divinity of divinities, and hide these holy teachings in your
          minds, shielding them from the unclean multitude so that you may keep
          them as uniform as possible.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Secondly, if any subtleties are proposed to uncultivated people, these
          folk may find in the imperfect comprehension of them matter for error;
          wherefore, in 1 Cor. 3:1 it is said: “And I, brethren, could not speak
          to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little,ones in
          Christ, I gave you milk to drink, not meat.” And therefore also, on
          Exod. 21:33, “If a man open a pit,” the gloss of Gregory says: “He who
          in sacred eloquence now understands lofty things should cover over
          these sublime truths by silence when in the presence of those who do
          not comprehend them, lest through some scandal of mind he cause the
          loss of some little one among the faithful or of an infidel who
          otherwise might have come to believe. Those truths, therefore, ought
          to be hidden from those to whom they might do harm; but a distinction
          can be made as regards speaking, since these same truths may be
          privately revealed to the wise, though publicly silence is kept
          regarding them.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Thus, Augustine (IV <i>De doctrina Christiana</i>) says: “Where
          certain truths are, by reason of their own character, not
          comprehensible, or scarcely so, even when explained with every effort
          on the part of the speaker to make them clear, these one rarely dwells
          upon with a general audience, or never mentions, at all: but in
          writing, the same distinction cannot be adhered to, because a book,
          once published, can fall into the hands of any one at all, and
          therefore some truths should be shielded by obscuring words so that
          they may profit those who will understand them and be hidden from the
          simple who will not comprehend them.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          And by this procedure no harm is done to anyone, because those who
          understand are held by that which they read, but those who do not
          understand are not compelled to continue reading. And therefore
          Augustine says in the same place: “In books which are, so written that
          they somehow keep a hold on the attention of the reader who
          understands them, but cause no harm to the one who does not understand
          them and so is unwilling to read further, there is no failure in duty
          on the part of the author as long as we bring these truths, even
          though they are so difficult of comprehension, to the understanding of
          some.”

          1. It is answered: The authority quoted is not relevant to the
          proposition. For it is not to be understood that the teaching of
          prudent men be “easy” in the active sense; that is, that they easily
          teach everything; but in the passive sense: that such men are easily
          taught, as is evident from the gloss.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. It may be answered: These authorities speak of hiding truths which
          ought to be made manifest; wherefore it is previously said in Sirach
          4:28, “Refrain not to speak in the time of salvation.” By this,
          however, there is no denial of the fact that gore are mysteries which
          ought to be concealed by obscuring words.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. It may be said: The doctrine of Christ ought to be taught publicly
          and openly to this extent: that the truths expedie nt for each one to
          know be made clear. Things that are not expedient, however, need not
          be publicly taught.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. It may be answered: The doctors of sacred Scripture are not debtors
          to the wise and to the foolish in such a way that they must propose
          the same truths to both, but that they propose to each what is to the
          advantage of each.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It may be said: Subtle truths are not concealed from the multitude
          on account of envy, but rather out of due discretion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. It may be answered: Augustine is here speaking of explanations made
          orally to the people, not of those transmitted in writing, as is
          evident from what follows.

          1.1.1.2 but that form of faith has supreme authority, and has it
          exclusively, which, both on account of the universal character of the
          rules and doctrines affirming its authority, and because the worship
          in which they are expressed has spread throughout the world, is called
          catholic or universal.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2.2 Sameness is predicated in three ways: by genus; e.g., a man and a
          horse, because of their common genus, animal. By species; e.g., Cato
          and Cicero, because of their common species, man. By number; e.g.,
          Tullius and Cicero, because they are numerically one. Similarly
          difference is expressed by genus, species, and number.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2.3 But a variety of accidents brings about numerical difference;
          three men differ neither by genus nor species, but by their accidents,
          for if we mentally remove from them all other accidents, still each
          one occupies a different place which cannot possibly be regarded as
          the same for each, since two bodies cannot occupy the same place, and
          place is an accident. Wherefore it is because men are plural by their
          accidents that they are plural in number.

          Hereupon, after the Prooemium, Boethius begins his treatise
          <i>De Trinitate Personarum, et Unitate divinae essentiae</i>: and this
          book is divided into two parts. First, he discusses those things which
          tain to the unity of the divine essence, making opposition the Arians.
          Secondly, he treats of those things which pertain to the Trinity of
          persons, in opposition to Sabellius, beginning: “In as many ways as
          things are the same, in the same number of ways they are said to be
          diverse.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The first part is also divided into two sections. In the first, he
          proposes the doctrine of the Catholic faith in regard to the unity of
          the divine essence. Secondly, he investigates the truth of the
          doctrine proposed when he says: “Therefore...” In the first section he
          treats of two things. First, he represents the condition of that faith
          whose doctrine he intends to explain. Secondly, he sets forth the
          doctrine of the faith he has described concerning this proposition,
          saying: “The belief of this religion concerning the Trinity.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.1.1.1 He describes this religion in a twofold manner, namely, by
          comparison with heretical cults, which it excels, and also in its own
          name since it is called catholic or universal. He says, therefore,
          that there are many, that is, many sects of diverse heresies, who make
          unlawful claims, since they unduly attribute to themselves the honor
          of the Christian religion, that is, the honor which ought to be paid
          to it: namely, that all others should be subject to it. 1 John 5:4:
          “This is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith.” Or, again,
          they claim the dignity which belongs to the Christian religion in that
          it manifests the glory of God by believing those truths which have
          been divinely revealed.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.1.1.2 “But that form of faith has supreme authority, and has it
          exclusively.” Here he adds the two things that make it distinct both
          according to truth and according to reputation. Now according to the
          truth of the matter, heretics are not Christians, since they cut
          themselves off from the teachings of Christ, and in this respect the
          Catholic faith alone is valid. But according to appearances and in the
          opinion of men, heretics are called Christians because they do indeed
          still, at least in word, confess the name of Christ; and according to
          this aspect, the Catholic faith is not the only one, but holds the
          place of greater authority.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          That this religion is the more common and the more widely diffused is
          understood when he says, “is called catholic or universal.” Now this
          is the same thing; for catholic in the Greek, means the same as the
          Latin universal. For the use of this name, he assigns two reasons,
          saying: “On account of the precepts of its universal rules,” for the
          precepts which the Catholic religion sets forth are not to be observed
          by one race alone, but by all: and in this respect it differs
          especially from the Law of Moses which gave precepts to one people
          alone. Likewise even individual heresies propose rules that are
          accommodated to their own members only; while the Catholic faith,
          having the care of all, gives its precepts to all: not to the
          unmarried alone, as do the Manichaeans, but also to the married; not
          to the innocent alone, as do the Novatians, but to sinners as well,
          for whom that sect would make salvation impossible. Wherefore he adds:
          “the authority of this religion is evident because of its universal
          rules,” on account of which all ought to be subject to it.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Or they may be called universal rules since there is in them no
          falsity or any admixture of evil, neither in any essential article or
          accidentally. Then he adds another reason, saying: “Because the
          worship in which they are expressed has spread throughout the world,”
          a thing which is evidently in accord with that saying of Ps. 18:5:
          “Their sound has gone forth into all the earth: and their words unto
          the ends of the world.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.1.2 Hereupon he next sets forth the doctrine of the Catholic faith
          concerning the question proposed: “The belief of this religion
          concerning the Trinity.” Concerning this, he does three things: First,
          he presents the teaching of the Catholic faith on the unity of the
          Trinity. Secondly, the reason for this opinion: “The principle of this
          unity.” Thirdly, he shows the fitness of the reason, saying: “Now the
          essence of plurality.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.1.2.1 Moreover, he proposes the opinion of Catholic faith in a
          certain argumentative form, because faith is called “the evidence of
          things that appear not” (Heb. 11:1). In the same argument, indeed,
          from the fact that divinity is attributed equally to each of the
          Persons, he concludes that of all three the name “God” is ‘Predicated
          not plurally, as taken together, but individually.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.1.2.2 Next he assigns the reason for this belief. First, he states
          the reason, and secondly, he explains it by its contrary where he
          says: “Difference cannot be avoided by those who add to or take from
          the Unity.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.1.2.2.1 Therefore he says: “The nature of Their Unity is such that
          there is no difference,” namely, the Unity of Deity in the three
          Persons, as confessed by the Catholic faith. From this the conclusion
          following upon the foregoing words is that Deity without difference is
          attributed to each of the three Persons; (1.1.2.2.2) and this
          reasoning he explains by its contrary saying: “Difference cannot be
          avoided by those who add to or take from the Unity (of the Deity)”:
          that is, who hold that one Person is greater or less than the others,
          as the Arians, who make the Father greater than the Son. Wherefore he
          continues: “As for instance the Arians, who by graduating the Trinity,
          break it up”; that is, by graduating the Trinity according to dignity,
          since they make the Son subject to the Father, and the Holy Spirit to
          both Father and Son, and so “convert it to Plurality”; that is,
          produce diversity by dividing the Deity among the Persons. For from
          division there follows plurality. Conversely, Catholics who confess an
          equality of the Persons, an equality without difference, make
          profession of consequent Unity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.2.3.1.1 Next, he shows that the foregoing reasoning is valid,
          saying: “For the essence of plurality is otherness,” and first he
          points out the necessity possessed by this reasoning. Secondly, what
          in the demonstration itself had been supposed is made clear: “In fact,
          the difference between three or more things lies in genus or species
          or number.” Regarding the first point he does two things. First he
          shows that otherness is the principle of plurality, understanding by
          “otherness” any difference by which things can be constituted among
          themselves as other. And he prefers to say “otherness” rather than
          “separateness” because not only substantial differences constitute
          plurality, since they make another thing, but accidental differences
          also constitute plurality, since they make for otherness: they make a
          thing other. Now otherness follows upon separateness; but the converse
          is not true. And the reason for the deduction of the Arians follows
          from this supposition. For if otherness is the principle of plurality,
          and positing a cause posits its effect, then supposing in them that
          otherness is by augmentation and diminution, plurality of divinity
          would follow.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.2.3.1.2 Secondly, he proposes that otherness is properly the
          principle of plurality, because, except for it, understanding of
          plurality is impossible; and according to this principle is the
          Catholic explanation of divine unity: for if a proper cause is taken
          away, so also is the effect. If, therefore, in the three Persons there
          is no otherness of Deity, there will be no plurality, but unity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.2.3.2 Next, he proves what was supposed, namely, that otherness is
          the proper principle of plurality, when he says, “In fact, the
          difference between three or more things.” And the reason is that in
          all things that differ in genus or species or number, there is some
          otherness or difference which is the cause of plurality or, diversity.
          But all plural things, whether three or more, are diverse either
          generically, specifically, or numerically; therefore some kind of
          otherness is the principle of all plurality.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2.1 In explaining this, he does three things. First, he states the
          minor; secondly its proof, beginning, “In as many ways as things are
          the same, in the same number of ways they are said to be diverse.”
          This is [the demonstration of] the proof: In as many ways as things
          are said to be the same, in the same number of ways they are said to
          be diverse. But things are said to be the same in three ways, namely,
          in genus, species, and number. Therefore things are said to be diverse
          in the same number of ways. The first is supposed from what is stated
          in I <i>Topic.</i>, that as much is said of one of two opposites as is
          said of the other: and from the saying of X <i>Metaph.</i>, that the
          same and different are opposites.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2.2 The second is made clear by examples and supposes what is said in
          I <i>Topic.</i>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2.3 Thirdly, he proves the major in regard to that point which might
          be held in doubt, saying: “But a variety of accidents brings about
          numerical difference.” That the diversity of those things which are
          diverse according to genus or species must have as principle some
          otherness, is evident from the name itself. For from the fact that
          things are of different genera it is evident that a different, or
          other, genus belongs to each; and if they differ in species, it is
          because they are contained under other species. But in the case of
          things which are said to be diverse numerically, it is not evident
          from the name itself that otherness is the principle of plurality.
          Furthermore, it might rather appear to be the converse according to
          the name and that plurality, which is designated by number, might be
          the principle of diversity, since things numerically different are
          different according to the same name employed when difference is by
          genus or species: Therefore, to prove the major of his syllogism, he
          shows that this difference by which things are said to differ
          numerically is produced by a certain kind of otherness or variety. He
          proves this by the fact that in three men who agree in genus and
          species, but who differ numerically, there is found accidental
          otherness, just as between man and ox there is specific otherness and
          between man and stone generic otherness. Wherefore, as man and ox
          differ specifically, so two men differ accidentally.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          And because some one might be able to say that accidental variety is
          not the cause of numerical plurality since, if accidents are done away
          with-either removed actually, as when separable, or by the mind and in
          thought, as when inseparable—substance still remains, since accident
          is that which can be present or absent without corruption of the
          substance: therefore he forestalls this objection, saying that,
          although all accidents might indeed be separated from a substance by
          the mind, nevertheless the diversity of one accident could in no way,
          even by the mind, be separated from diverse individuals, namely,
          diversity of place. For two individuals cannot be in the same place
          either according to fact or according to any fiction of the mind,
          since this cannot be understood or imagined. Wherefore he concludes
          that from the fact that men are plural in number they are plural by
          reason of accidents; that is, they are for this reason diversified;
          and with this is terminated the teaching of this part of the treatise.

          This question is twofold. First, there is consideration of those

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Objections</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It seems that faith should not be considered necessary for mankind.
          As is said in Eccles. 7:1, “What needeth a man to seek things that are
          above him?” This is to say, there is no need. But those things that
          are believed by faith are above man, as exceeding his reason;
          otherwise ~his reason, which is the cause of science, would suffice.
          Therefore it was not necessary for man that, over and above the truths
          of reason, he should be taught those of faith.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. God established human nature as something perfect when He created
          it. Deut. 32:4, “The works of God are perfect.” But from the ability
          bestowed upon the human mind according to its original condition, man
          cannot attain to those things which must be known by faith; otherwise
          he would be able to possess scientific knowledge of them, a knowledge
          which is caused by the fact that conclusions are resolved into
          naturally known principles. Since, therefore, a thing is called
          perfect if it lacks nothing that it ought to possess, as is said in V
          <i>Metaph.</i>, it seems that man does not require faith.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Every wise man makes choice of the shorter way to reach a goal: but
          it would appear exceedingly difficult for a creature to believe truths
          which are above reason and, in the case of men, extremely dangerous,
          since many fall away from the state of salvation because they do not
          believe; therefore, it seems that God, who is all-wise, ought not to
          have established faith as the way of salvation for men.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Whenever there is acceptance of knowledge without judgment, the
          road to error is easy; but we have in ourselves no ability by which we
          are able to judge of the things which we accept by faith, since our
          natural judgment does not extend to truths of this kind, as they
          exceed reason; therefore evidently the road to error is an easy one
          for us, and so it would appear rather harmful than useful for man that
          he should be directed to God by the way of faith.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. As Dionysius says, it is an evil for man to exist apart from
          reason; but man in adhering to faith departs from reason, and in this
          he is even accustomed to despise reason; therefore it seems that such
          a way is evil for men.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Sed contra</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But on the contrary, it is said in Heb. 11:6, “Without faith it is
          impossible to please God”; but it is supremely necessary for man that
          he be pleasing to God, since otherwise he can neither do nor possess
          any good; therefore faith is most necessary for man.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, it is most necessary for man to know the truth, since beatitude
          is joy in knowing the truth, as Augustine says; but faith establishes
          believers in truth and establishes truth in them, as Dionysius says
          (<i>De div. nom.</i>, chap. 7); therefore faith is most necessary for
          man.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, that without which human society cannot be conserved is
          especially necessary for man, since man is a political animal, as is
          said in VIII <i>Ethic.</i>; but without faith human society cannot be
          preserved, since it is requisite that one man believe in the promises
          of another and in his testimony and the like, for this is necessary if
          they are to live together; therefore faith is most necessary for
          mankind.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer that it must
          be said that faith has something in common with opinion, and something
          in common with knowledge and understanding, by reason of which it
          holds a position midway between opinion and understanding or science,
          according to Hugh of St. Victor. In common with understanding and
          knowledge, it possesses certain and fixed assent; and in this it
          differs from opinion, which accepts one of two opposites, though with
          fear that the other may be true, and on account of this doubt it
          fluctuates between two contraries. But, in common with opinion, faith
          is concerned with things that are not naturally possible to our
          understanding, and in this respect it differs from science and
          intellection.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          That a thing should not be apparent to human understanding can arise
          for two reasons, as is said in II <i>Metaph.</i>: namely, because of
          lack of knowability in things themselves, and because of lack of
          intellectual ability on our part.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It may be due to lack on the part of things, as in the case of
          singular and contingent things which are remote from our senses, like
          the deeds and words and thoughts of men; for these are of such a
          nature that they may be known to one man, but unknown to others. And
          since among men dwelling together one man should deal with another as
          with himself in what he is not self-sufficient, therefore it is
          needful that he be able to stand with as much certainty on what
          another knows, but of which he himself is ignorant, as upon the truths
          which he himself knows. Hence it is that in human society faith is
          necessary in order that one man give credence to the words of another,
          and this is the foundation of justice, as Tullius says in his book,
          <i>De officiis</i>. Hence also it is that no lie is without sin, since
          every lie derogates from that faith which is so necessary.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. The truth of things may also not be evident because of defect on
          our part, as in the case of divine and necessary things which,
          according to their own nature, are most knowable. Wherefore, to
          understand them, we are not capable of immediate intellection, from
          the very beginning, since it is in accordance with our nature to
          attain from things less knowable and posterior in themselves, to
          knowledge of those that are themselves more knowable and prior. But
          since from none of those things that we know last do we have any
          knowledge of those that we know first, it is needful for us even at
          first to have some notion of those things that are most knowable in
          themselves; but this cannot be except by believing. And this is
          evident even in the order of the sciences; since that science which is
          concerned with highest causes, namely, metaphysics, comes last in
          human knowledge; yet in sciences that are preambles to it there must
          be supposed certain truths which only in it are more fully revealed;
          therefore every science has some suppositions that must be believed in
          order to cafty on the process of learning.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Since, therefore, the end of human life is beatitude, which consists
          in the full cognition of divine truths, it is necessary that human
          life be directed to this beatitude by an initial possession of divine
          truths by faith, truths which man can hope to know fully in the
          ultimate state of human perfection.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Certain of these truths that must be known can be attained by reason
          even in this life: however, although knowledge of them is possible and
          even possessed by certain men, nevertheless faith is necessary for
          five reasons, which Rabbi Moses enumerates:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. First, on account of the depth and subtlety of the matter, by which
          divine truths are hidden from human understanding. Therefore, lest any
          man be without some knowledge of them, provision is made that through
          faith, at least, he know divine truths. Therefore, in Eccles. 7:25 it
          is said: “It is a great depth, who shall find it out?”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Secondly, on account of the weakness of the human intellect from
          the beginning. For perfection of knowledge does not belong to the
          human intellect except at the end; therefore, that it should at no
          time lack a knowledge of God, it requires faith by which it may accept
          divine truths from the very beginning.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Thirdly, because of the many preambles that are required for a
          knowledge of God according to reason. For this there is needed
          knowledge of almost all the sciences, since cognition of divine things
          is the end of them all. But few indeed would comprehend these
          preambulatory truths or investigate them completely. Therefore, lest
          large numbers of men should be left without knowledge of divine
          things, the way of faith has been provided by God Himself.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. In the fourth place, many men on account of their natural
          constitution are unfitted for perfect intellectual investigation
          according to reason; therefore, that these might not lack knowledge of
          divine truths, the way of faith has been provided.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. In the fifth place, because of numerous occupations with,which men
          are busied, it would be impossible for all of them to discover, by way
          of reason, necessary truth in regard to God, and on this account the
          way of faith has been established, both as regards things that might
          in some way be known and as regards those that required revelation in
          order that they be believed.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But in the case of certain divine truths, for a complete understanding
          of them the human mind in no way suffices, but full knowledge of them
          is to be awaited in that future life when there will be complete
          beatitude: such is the truth of the Trinity and the unity of one God;
          and man is led to knowledge of this, not in accordance with anything
          due his nature, but by divine grace alone. Therefore it is necessary
          that, for a perfection of knowledge of this kind, certain suppositions
          be proposed which must be believed at first, and from these one is
          directed into full cognition of those truths which at the outset he
          held on faith, even as in other sciences also, as has been said. Hence
          in Is. 7:9 it is said, according to one translation: “Unless thou
          hadst believed, thou wouldst not understand.” And suppositions of this
          sort are those that must be believed by all, since in this life they
          are neither known nor understood by, any one.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to objections</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It may be said: Although matters of faith considered according to
          man’s natural powers are above him, they are not above man when he is
          illuminated by divine light; hence it is not necessary for man that he
          seek out such truths by his own power, but it is necessary for him to
          know them by divine revelation.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. It may be said: God, in the first creation of things, established
          man as perfect in accordance with the perfection of his nature, and
          this consisted in the fact that man had all things due to his nature.
          But over and above that due to nature there were added afterward to
          the human race certain other perfections owing their source to divine
          grace alone, and among these was faith, as is evident from Eph. 2:8,
          where it is said of faith that it is “the gift of God.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. It may be said: For anyone striving to attain beatitude it is
          necessary to know in what he ought to seek this beatitude, and in what
          way. But this, indeed, can be done in no easier way than through
          faith, since investigation by reason cannot attain to such knowledge
          except after a previous knowledge of many other things, things not
          easy to know. Nor can one attain to such knowledge without danger,
          since human investigation, because of the weakness of our intellect,
          is prone to error; and this is clearly shown by reference to those
          philosophers who, in attempting to find out the purpose of human life
          by way of reason, did not find in themselves the true method, and so
          fell into many and shameful errors; and so greatly did they differ
          among themselves that scarcely two or three among them all were in
          agreement on any one question; yet, on the other hand, we see that by
          faith many peoples are brought to the acceptance of one common belief.

          4. It may be said: Whenever there is acceptance of a truth, by
          whatever mode of assent, there must be something which moves the mind
          to assent: just as the naturally possessed light of the intellect
          causes assent to first principles, and the truth of those first
          principles causes assent to conclusions made from them; while in other
          ways we assent to things of which we have an opinion, though, if
          motives were a little stronger, they would incline us to belief, in so
          far as faith is said to be opinion. But that which inclines the mind
          to assent to the first principles of understanding or to conclusions
          known from these principles is a sufficient induction which forces
          assent, and is sufficient to judge of those things to which the mind
          gives its assent. On the other hand, whatever inclines one to form an
          opinion, even though with a good amount of conviction, is not that
          sufficient form of induction whereby assent is forced, nor by reason
          of it can there be perfect judgment of the things to which assent is
          given. Therefore also in faith by which we believe in God, not only is
          there acceptance of the truths to which we give assent, but also
          something which inclines us to that assent; and this is the special
          light which is the habit of faith, divinely infused into the human
          mind. This, moreover, is more sufficient for inducing belief than any
          demonstration, for, though from the latter no false conclusions are
          reached, still man frequently errs in this: that he thinks something
          is a demonstration which is not. The light of faith is also more
          sufficient than the natural light of reason by which we assent to
          first principles, since this natural light is often impeded by bodily
          infirmity, as is evident in the case of the. insane. But the light of
          faith, which is, as it were, a kind of impression of the First Truth
          in our minds, cannot fail, any more than God can deceive us or lie;
          therefore this light suffices for making judgment.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          This habit of faith, nevertheless, does not move us by way of
          intellectual understanding, but more by way of the will; therefore it
          does not make us comprehend those truths which we believe, nor does it
          force assent, but it causes us to assent to them voluntarily. And thus
          it is evident that faith comes in two ways: namely, from God by reason
          of the interior light which induces assent, and also by reason of
          those truths which are proposed exteriorly and take their source from
          divine revelation. These latter are related to the knowledge which is
          oi faith as things known by the senses are to knowledge of first
          principles, because in both cases there is a certain determination
          given to cognition. Therefore, as cognition of first principles is
          received by way of sense experience, and yet the light by which those
          principles are known is innate, so faith comes by way of hearing, and
          yet the habit of faith is infused.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It may be said: To live in accordance with reason is the good of
          man inasmuch as he is man. Now, to live apart from reason, according
          to one meaning, can be understood as a defect, as it is in those who
          live according to sense; and this is an evil in man. But in another
          way, it may mean to live above reason as when, by divine grace, a man
          is led to that which exceeds reason: and in this case, to live apart
          from reason is not an evil in man, but a good above that which is
          human. And such is the cognition of truths of faith, although faith
          itself is not in every way outside reason; for, it is the natural
          reason which holds that assent ought to be given to truths declared by
          God.

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It seems that faith ought not to be distinguished from religion,
          because, as Augustine says in <i>Ench.</i>, “God is to be worshiped by
          faith, hope, and charity”; but worship of God is an act of religion,
          as is evident from the definition of Tullius, which says: “Religion is
          that which offers to a superior nature, which men call divine, worship
          and ceremony”; therefore faith pertains to religion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Augustine says in <i>De vera religione</i>: The true religion is
          that by which the one God is honored and known with a most unsullied
          piety or purity.” But to know God is a thing which belongs to faith;
          therefore, faith is contained under religion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. To offer sacrifice to God is a function or act of religion, but
          this pertains to faith, as Augustine says in IV <i>De civ. Dei</i>:
          “True sacrifice is any work done in order that we may adhere to God in
          holy association”; but the first adherence of man to God is by faith;
          therefore faith pertains principally to religion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. In John 4:24 it is said: “God is a Spirit, and they that adore Him,
          must adore Him in spirit and in truth.” Now, God is adored more when
          one submits his intellect to Him than when a bodily prostration is
          made; but through faith the intellect is submitted to God, since it
          subjects itself entirely in assenting to the truths revealed by God;
          therefore faith pertains especially to religion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. Every virtue having God as its object is a theological virtue: but
          religion has God as its object, since it is nothing else than the
          offering of due reverence to God; therefore it is a theological
          virtue. But it appears to belong more to faith than to any of the
          others, since only those are said to be outside the Christian religion
          who are outside [i.e., without] faith; therefore religon seems to be
          the same as faith.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Sed contra</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          On the contrary is what Tullius says in II <i>Veteris Rhetoricae</i>,
          where he makes religion a part of justice, which is a moral virtue.
          Therefore, since faith is a theological virtue, religion is of a genus
          other than that of faith.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, religion consists also in activity regarding the neighbor, as
          is evident in Jas. 1:27: “Religion clean and undefiled before God and
          the Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their
          tribulation”; faith has no act except that which is referred to God;
          therefore religion is altogether distinct from faith.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, those are commonly called “religious” who are bound by special
          vows, but they are not the only ones called 1. the faithful.” Since,
          therefore, one of the faith and a religious are not the same thing,
          faith and religion are not the same.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer that it must
          be said that, as is evident from Augustine (X <i>De civ. Dei</i>),
          <i>theosebia</i>, which the worship of God is called, includes as
          pertaining to it in the same way, religion, piety and latria, since
          all have as their purpose the worship of God. Reverence paid to
          anything, however, seems to be nothing else than a due operation
          performed with regard to it; and consequently men are said to cherish
          in various ways their fields, their parefits, their country, and other
          like things because different works are fitting to each. But God is
          not “cherished” in this same way: that any operation of ours would be
          of benefit or assistance to Him, as in the case of the above-mentioned
          instances; but it implies only that we submit ourselves to Him and
          show ourselves to be His subjects. Therefore this reverence which is
          absolutely divine is designated by the name of <i>theosebia</i>. But
          religion implies a certain “binding, back” according to which man
          obliges himself in some manner to this worship of God; wherefore
          Augustine says in his book, <i>De vera religione</i>: “The word
          ‘religion’ is thought to be derived from the <i>religare</i> (‘to bind
          back’), or from <i>recte eligere</i> (‘to choose rightly’),” as is
          said in IV <i>De civ. Dei</i>. For it is by proper choicethat a person
          binds himself to do something that must be done. We must also reelect
          those things which by negligence we have lost, as he also says.
          Therefore it is that those who consecrate their whole lives and
          themselves to the service of God by certain vows are called religious;
          but piety regards the mind of the worshiper, that it be not insincere
          or moved by desire of gain.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Since also a certain divine veneration, as it were, is due to those
          above us, even the acts of kindness which are done for the unfortunate
          are in a way sacrifices to God, according to the last part of the
          Epistle to the Hebrews (13: 16): “And do not forget to do good and to
          impart: for by such sacrifices God’s favor is obtained.” Hence it is
          that the name of piety and of religion are transferred to works of
          mercy, and especially to benefits done to parents and country. But
          latria implies a reverence that is of obligation, or worship in its
          essence; and this is so because we are, indeed, the subjects of Him
          whom we honor, not after the manner in which one man is said to be the
          servant of another, because of some accidental debt to him, but
          because all that we are we owe to Him as our Creator. Therefore latria
          is not any kind of service, but that by which man acknowledges his
          subjection to God. Thus, therefore, religion consists in an operation
          by which man honors God by submitting to Him; and this operation ought
          to be in harmony with Him who is honored, and with the one offering
          homage.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now since He who is reverenced is a spirit, He cannot be approached by
          the body, but only by the mind; and so worship of Him consists chiefly
          in acts of the mind by which the mind itself is ordained to God. These
          acts are principally those of the theological virtues; and in
          accordance with this, Augustine says that God is worshiped by faith,
          hope, and charity, to which are added also the acts of the gifts
          ordained toward God, such as those of wisdom and of fear.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But because we who honor God are also possessed of bodies and receive
          our knowledge through bodily senses, there is the necessity that
          certain physical actions accompany the worship of God, not only that
          we may render service to God with our whole being, but also that by
          these bodily actions we may arouse in ourselves and in others acts of
          the mind ordained to God. Wherefore Augustine says in his book,
          <i>De cura pro mortuis habenda</i>: “Those who pray make the members
          of their bodies conform to their acts of supplication when they
          genuflect, extend their hands, or prostrate themselves upon the
          ground, or perform any other visible action; and although it is their
          invisible will and the intention of the heart that is known to God, it
          is not unseemly that the human soul should so express itself, but
          rather by so doing man stirs himself to pray and to lament his sins
          the more humbly and fervently.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Hence, all acts by which man subjects himself to God, whether they are
          acts of mind or of body, pertain to religion. But because those things
          that are rendered to the neighbor on account of God are rendered to
          God Himself, it is evident that they also pertain to this same
          subjection in which religious worship consists; and so to one
          diligently considering the matter it is apparent that every good act
          pertains to religion. Hence Augustine says (<i>loc. cit.</i>): “True
          sacrifice is every work done that we may adhere to God in holy
          companionship; however, in a certain order.” First and foremost, those
          acts of the mind ordained to God pertain to the worship which we are
          speaking of. Secondly, there are acts of the body intended to arouse
          reverence of mind or to give expression to it, such as prostrations,
          sacrifices, and the like. Thirdly, there also pertain to divine
          worship all other acts ordained to the neighbor for the sake of God.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Nevertheless, as magnanimity is a certain special virtue, although it
          uses the acts of all virtues, since it bestows a grandeur in the
          exercise of them all and so regards its object under a certain special
          aspect; so also religion is a special virtue in the acts of all the
          virtues, considering a special aspect of its object, namely, that
          which is due to God; and thus it forms a part of justice. There are,
          moreover, special acts assigned to religion, which pertain to no other
          virtue, such as prostrations and the like, in which the worship of God
          consists secondarily.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          From this it is evident that acts of faith pertain, indeed, materially
          to religion, as do the acts of other virtues, and the more so inasmuch
          as acts of faith are the first motions of the mind toward God; but
          formally faith is distinguished from religion, as regarding another
          aspect of its object. Faith agrees with religion also because faith is
          the cause and principle, of religion. For no one would elect to
          manifest reverence to God unless by faith he held that God was the
          Creator, Ruler, and Rewarder of human actions.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Nevertheless religion is not a theological virtue: for it has as its
          matter all acts, as those of faith or ‘of any other virtue inasmuch as
          these are offered as due to God; but it has God as its end. For to
          worship God is to offer acts of this kind as due to God.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          From what has been said, the response to all the objections is
          evident.

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It seems that the Christian religion ought not be called Catholic,
          because knowledge must be proportionate to the knowability of a thing.
          Now an indefinite thing is not known in any way at all: but faith is a
          knowledge of God who is neither universal nor particular, as Augustine
          says in his book, <i>De Trinitate</i>; therefore this religion cannot
          be called universal.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. One can have only singular knowledge about singular things; but by
          faith we hold the truth of certain singular facts, as the Passion and
          Resurrection of Christ, and the like; therefore the Christian faith
          cannot be called universal.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. From what is common to many, it is not permissible to impose a name
          as proper to any one of them, since a name is given in order that a
          thing may be known as distinct: but every school or sect proposes
          certain things that must be universally held by all its followers, or
          certain doctrines that must be universally affirmed as true; therefore
          the Christian religion has no special right to be called Catholic.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Idolatry extends to every corner of the earth; but the Christian
          religion has not yet been brought to all the regions of the world,
          since there are yet some barbarians who do not know the faith of
          Christ; therefore these idolatrous sects, rather than the Christian
          religion, deserve the name of Catholic.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. What does not include all should not be called universal; but the
          Christian religion is not accepted by many; therefore it is inaptly
          called universal or Catholic.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Sed contra</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          On the contrary is that which Augustine says in
          <i>De vera religione</i>: “The Christian religion must be held by us,
          and the communication of that Church which is catholic and which is
          called Catholic, not only by its own members, but even by its
          enemies.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, universal and common appear to be the same; but the Christian
          faith is called the common faith by the Apostle (Titus 1:4): “To
          Titus, my beloved son according to the common faith”; therefore it is
          rightly called Catholic.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again what is universally proposed to all should in a special way be
          called universal; but the Christian faith is universally proposed to
          all, as is evident in the last chapter of Matthew (28:19), “Teach all
          nations,” etc.; therefore it is deservedly called Catholic or
          universal.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer that it must
          be said that faith, just as any other cognition, has a twofold matter:
          namely, that in which it exists (the believers themselves) and that
          about which it is concerned (the truths believed); and as regards both
          types of matter, the Christian religion can be called Catholic.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          As regards the believers it is Catholic because the Apostle (Rom. 3:2)
          asserts that that is the true religion which was given testimony to by
          the law and the prophets. Since, however, in the times of the prophets
          various tribes offered worship to different gods, only one nation, the
          people of Israel, gave due honor to the true God, and so there did not
          exist that one universal religion which was foretold to them by the
          Holy Spirit, that worship of the true God which would be paid by all.
          Therefore Isaias (45:24) says: “For every knee shall be bowed to Me,
          and every tongue shall swear.” And this prophecy has, indeed, been
          fulfilled by faith and the Christian religion.

          Therefore deservedly is that faith called Catholic since it has been
          accepted by men of every condition. And thus, those who have fallen
          away from this faith and this religion which has been so universally
          foretold and received, and who have become divided into various sects,
          are not called Catholics, but as it were, having been cut off from the
          communion of the faithful, they are called heretics.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          As regards the truths proposed for belief in the Christian religion,
          there is also found truth that is catholic. Now, there were various
          arts and ways in ancient times according as there was vision, or
          belief in the vision of the human mind among men. For certain men
          placed the good of man in corporeal things alone, either in riches or
          in honors or in pleasures. Some others placed this good in the soul
          alone, as in moral or intellectual virtues. Certain others, as
          Augustine says in his book, <i>De civ. Dei</i>, thought that gods
          ought to be honored because of the corporeal blessings of this life;
          but others, on account of blessings to be realized after death.
          Porphyry also relates that it was believed among certain peoples of
          the earth that the imaginative part of the soul would be cleansed, but
          not the whole soul; and he said, as Augustine tells in X
          <i>De civ. Dei</i>, that there had not yet been found a single sect
          that possessed a universal way for liberty of spirit. Now this way, as
          Augustine says in the same place, is the Christian religion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          This religion teaches that God is to be honored not only on account of
          eternal, but also because of temporal benefits; that He rules man not
          only in spiritual ways but also in all that concerns him bodily, and
          that He promises beatitude for both soul and body. Hence His
          regulations are called universal, as pertaining to the whole life of
          man and as extending to all that in any way affects man. For these two
          reasons, therefore, thename “universal” is given to the Christian
          religion, as Boethius in the text makes clear.

          1. It may, therefore, be answered: Although God is in Himself neither
          universal nor particular, yet He is the universal cause and end of all
          things, and thus knowledge which is held concerning Him is universal
          since it extends to all things.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. It may be said: Faith holds these particular facts as universal
          remedies for the healing and the liberation of the whole human race.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Answer may be made: Other sects claim for themselves what is proper
          to the Christian faith, but they cannot vindicate this claim;
          therefore, the name of universality does not properly belong to them.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. It may be said: Idolatry was no one form of religion, but differed
          among various peoples, since they set up for themselves various gods
          to be worshiped. Nor again, were those forms of idolatry accepted by
          all nations, since they were rejected by those who honored the true
          God, and even by the philosophers of the Gentiles, who said that
          certain religious ceremonigeought to be observed since they were
          commanded by law, but not because they could be known to please the
          gods, as Seneca said, according to Augustine in <i>De civ. Dei</i>.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It may be answered: The Christian religion is not called Catholic
          on account of individual nations who adhere to it, but on account of
          the body of individual men from all conditions of mankind who adhere
          to it.

          1. It seems that it is not the confession of the Catholic,faith that
          Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one God: because, as Boethius himself
          says, upon inequality there follows plurality of gods. But the
          Catholic Scripture, which is the head of the Catholic religion, as
          Augustine says in <i>De vera religione</i>, states that there is
          inequality between Father and Son, as is evident from what is said in
          the person of the Son in John 14:28: “The Father is greater than I.”
          Therefore what is said is not the confession of the Catholic religion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. 1 Cor. 15:28 says: “And when all things shall be subdued unto Him,
          then the Son also Himself shall be subject unto Him that put all
          things under Him, that God may be all in all.” And so the conclusion
          is like the former.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Prayer is not made except by an inferior to a superior: but the Son
          prays for us. Rom. 8:34, “Christ Jesus... who also makes intercession
          for us.” Likewise of the Holy Spirit it is said in the same place
          (8:26), “The Spirit Himself asks for us with unspeakable groanings.,”
          Therefore the Son and the Holy Spirit are inferior to the Father
          according to the confession of the Catholic faith, and so the
          conclusion is the same.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. John 17:3 gives the words of the Son addressing Himself to the
          Father: “That they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ,
          whom You have sent.” Therefore the Father alone is the true God, and
          not the Son and the Holy Spirit. Therefore they seem to be creatures,
          and so the same conclusion is reached.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. In 1 Tim. 6:15, the Apostle says: “Which in His times He shall
          show, who is the Blessed and only Mighty, the King of kings, and Lord
          of lords. Who only has immortality and inhabits light inaccessible.”
          Therefore all these titles belong only to the’Father, and so the
          conclusion is as before.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. In Mark 13:32 it is said: “But of that day or hour no man knoweth,
          neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.” Therefore
          the Father’s knowledge is greater than that of the Son. Consequently
          His essence also is greater, and thus the conclusion is the same.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. Matt. 20:23 says: “To sit on My right or left hand, is not Mine to
          give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared by My Father.”
          Therefore the power of the Son is not equal to that of the Father.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          8. In Col. 1:15, it is said of the Son that He is “the firstborn of
          every creature.” But this comparison would not be made unless of
          beings of one genus; therefore the Son is a creature.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          9. In Sirach 24:14 it is said in the person of divine Wisdom, “From
          the beginning, and before the world, was I created.” Thus the
          conclusion is the same.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          10. He who is revealed is less than he who reveals; but the Son is
          revealed by the Father, as is evident in John, chap. 12; therefore,
          the Son is less than the Father.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          11. The one sending is greater than the one sent. But the Father sends
          the Son, as is clear from Gal. 4:4, “God sent His Son,” etc. And He
          also sends the Holy Spirit, according to John 14:26, “The Paraclete,
          the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name.” Therefore the
          Father is greater than the Son and the Holy Spirit. And thus the
          aforesaid doctrine does not seem to be in accordance with the Catholic
          faith.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But on the contrary it is said in John 1:1, 3: “In the beginning was
          the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.... All
          things were made by Him,” etc. From this it is to be held that the Son
          is eternal, for otherwise He could not have been in the beginning: and
          that He is equal to the Father, for otherwise He would not be God: and
          that He is not a creature, for otherwise all things would riot have
          been made by Him.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, since the Son is truth, He could not lie concerning Himself.
          But the Son said that He was equal to the Father (John 5: 18): “He
          also said God was His Father, making Himself equal to God.” Therefore
          He is equal to the Father.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, Phil. 2:6 says: “He thought it not robbery to be equal with
          God.” But it would have been robbery if He thought that was so which
          was not. Therefore He is equal to God.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.” And John 14:11, “I am
          in the Father, and the Father in Me.” Therefore one is not greater
          than the other.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, Rom. 9:5: “And of whom is Christ, according to the flesh, who
          is over all things, God blessed forever.” Therefore no one is superior
          to Him; and thus He is not less than the Father.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, 1 John 5:20, “And we know that the Son of God is come: and He
          hath given us understanding that we may know the true God, and may be
          in His true Son. This is the true God and life eternal.” Therefore He
          is not less than the Father.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, it is shown that the Holy Spirit is the true God and equal to
          the Father by what is said in Phil. 3:3, according to the Greek text.
          “We are the circumcision, who serve God the Spirit”, and in regard to
          this service, that of latria is understood, as is evident in the
          Greek. And such honor is due to no creature. Deut. 6:13 and Matt.
          4:10: “The Lord your God you shall adore, and Him only you shall
          serve.” Therefore, the Holy Spirit is not a creature.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, the members of Christ cannot be the temple of anyone who is
          less than Christ: but our bodies, which are members of Christ,
          according to the Apostle, are temples of the Holy Spirit, as is said
          in 1 Cor. 6: 19. Therefore the Holy Spirit is not less than Christ, or
          less than the Father; and thus it is true, as the author says, that
          this is a doctrine of the Catholic religion.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer that it must
          be said that the position of the Arians, which establishes inequality
          among the divine persons, is not a confession of the Catholic
          religion, but rather an impiety of the Gentiles, as is thus evident.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Among the Gentiles all immortal substances are called gods. Among
          these, moreover, they hold, or rather the Platonists hold, that there
          are three principal persons, as is made clear by Augustine in
          <i>De civitate Dei</i> (Bk. X), and by Macrobius on the Somnium
          Scipionis, namely, the God, who is the Creator of all things, whom
          they call also the Father, since all things have their source in Him;
          and, secondly, a certain inferior substance, whom they call the
          Paternal Mind or the Paternal Intellect, who contains the ideas of all
          things, and who is made by God the Father, they say; and thirdly,
          after Him they suppose a Soul-of-the-World, a spirit who is, as it
          were, the life of the whole world. And these three substances they
          name as their chief gods, and as the three principles by which souls
          are purified.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Origen, moreover, following the teachings of the Platonists, thought
          that after the same manner the doctrine of the true faith ought to be
          interpreted, because it is said, “There are three who give testimony
          in heaven” (1 John 5:7). And so, as the Platonists supposed that there
          were three principal substances, Origen held that the Son was a
          creature and less than the Father, in that book which is entitled
          <i>Peri Archon</i> (“Concerning the Principles”), as is made clear by
          Jerome in a certain epistle regarding the errors of Origen. And since
          Origen himself taught at Alexandria, Arius drank in his error from the
          things he wrote. On this account Epiphanius says that Origen was the
          father and font of Arius.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Therefore the position of the Christian and Catholic faith regarding
          the Trinity differs as much from the position of Arius as does the
          error of the Gentiles, which, in calling creatures gods, rendered to
          them the service of divine praise. This the Apostle (Rom. 1:25)
          criticizes when he says, “They worshiped and served the creature
          rather than the Creator.”

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It may be said: As Augustine states in II <i>De Trinitate</i>,
          passages found in the Scriptures in regard to the Father and the Son
          are threefold.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          a) First, some show a certain unity of substance and equality of
          persons, as, “I and the Father are one” (John 10:30).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          b) Other passages show the Son to be less because of His having the
          form of a servant, according as He made Himself less, as is said in
          Phil. 2:7, “He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          c) Certain things are also said that show Him to be neither less nor
          the equal of the Father, but only that the Son is from the Father, as
          in John 5:26, “As the Father has life in Himself, so He hath given to
          the Son also to have life in Himself.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The first authoritative passages are used by Catholics in making a
          defense of the truth. But those of the second and third kind are
          employed by heretics in confirmation of their error, though in a vain
          attempt. For the things that are stated of Christ according to His
          human nature should not be referred to His divinity; otherwise it
          would follow that His death, which is recorded of Him according to His
          humanity, would be according to His divinity. Likewise, neither is it
          shown that the Son is less than the Father, although the Son is from
          the Father, because the Son has from the Father all that the Father
          possesses, as is held in John 16, and Matthew 11. Wherefore no
          inequality of divinity can be asserted because of the order of origin.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          When, therefore, it is said, “The Father is greater than I,” this is
          said of the Son according to His human nature and not according to His
          divine nature, as Augustine maintains; or, as Hilary says, according
          to His divine nature in such a way that “greater” does not imply
          inequality (because the Son is not less than the Father, inasmuch as
          to Him is given a name above all names); but it implies dignity of a
          principle inasmuch as it is from the Father that the Son possesses
          that by which He is the equal of the Father.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. It may be said: All things the Father not only subjected to the
          Son, but the Son Himself made them subject to Himself, according to
          the saying of Phil. 3:21: “According to the operation whereby also He
          is able to subdue all things unto Himself,” i.e., according to the
          Divinity which is equal in Him to that of the Father. Wherefore, when
          it is said that Christ will be subject, this does not imply relation
          of the Son to the Father according to Divinity, but rather the
          relation of the human nature of the Son to the Divinity of the Father,
          which Divinity is common to the whole Trinity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          And when the divine nature shall be perfectly known, then it will be
          apparent that especially according to His human nature He is subject
          to the divine nature; but not with such a subjection as that which
          certain heretics claim who say that the very human nature which was
          assumed by the divine nature is transmuted into it, but rather that He
          is less than the Father by reason of His humanity. This is made
          especially clear by the fact that He will deliver His kingdom, that
          is, the faithful, to the Father, not claiming them for Himself, but
          leading them to the vision of the Father, a vision in which His own
          Divinity also will be seen.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. It may be answered: According to Augustine (III
          <i>De Trinitate</i>), inasmuch as the Son prays He is less than the
          Father; but inasmuch as He obtains hearing with the Father, He is the
          equal of the Father.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But the Holy Spirit is said to intercede for us inasmuch as He causes

          4. It may be said: According to Augustine (VI <i>De Trinitate</i>),
          the statement that there is one only true God must not be interpreted
          to refer to the Father alone, but as including Father, Son, and Holy
          Ghost simultaneously; and they are said to be, the one true God
          because no being outside the Trinity is true God. Wherefore, it must
          be in this way that one understands: “That they may know You, the only
          true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent” (John 17:3). For there
          is one only true God, and no mention is here made of the Holy Spirit,
          because, since He is the nexus of the other two Persons, He is
          understood by mention of the other two.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It may be answered: According to Augustine (I <i>De Trinitate</i>),
          this saying is not to be understood of the Person of the Father alone,
          but of the entire Trinity. For the whole Trinity is blessed and
          powerful, and the whole Trinity shows forth the Son. Even if He did
          say: “He shall show, who is the Blessed and only Mighty,” etc., this
          would not indicate that the Son is separate from the Father, or that
          the Father is considered as being separated from the Son, because it
          is said in Sirach 24:8, in the person of the Son, who is the Wisdom of
          God, “I alone have compassed the circuit of heaven.” This is said,
          therefore, because in those things which pertain to the essence of
          God, Father and Son are altogether one, and hence what is said of one
          of them by diction which may be exclusive does not imply any mutual
          separation, but only their separation from creatures.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. It may be said: The Son knows “that day and hour,” not only
          according to His divine nature, but even according to His human
          nature, since His soul knows all things. Hence He is said not to know
          that day, as Augustine explains in I <i>De Trinitate</i>, because He
          does not make it known to us; wherefore He said to those questioning
          Him: “It is not for you to know the times,” etc. (Acts 1:7). And in
          the same way the Apostle says in 1 Cor. 2:2, “I judged not myself to
          know anything among you,” because he was unwilling to disclose lofty
          things to them since they lacked capacity to understand.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Or this may be understood as regarding the Son, not in His character
          as head of the Church, but in the person of His members, since the
          Church, as Jerome says, is without knowledge of these truths. However,
          in saying that the Father alone knows them, it is evident that the Son
          also knows them, according to the aforesaid reason.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. Answer may be made: As Augustine says in I <i>De Trinitate</i>, the
          verse: “It is not Mine to give to you,” etc., must be understood to
          mean that it is not in the power of human nature to give this, so that
          He may be known to grant it by reason of the fact that He is God and
          equal to the Father.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          8. It may be said: According to Augustine, I <i>De Trinitate</i>, many
          heretics, not understanding this point of apostolic doctrine, broke
          out into insult of the Son of God, saying and declaring that He was a
          creature, having little regard for the import of words. For He is
          said, indeed, to be the first begotten, but not the first created, so
          that He might be believed to have been begotten, according to His
          divine nature, and to be first on account of His perpetuity. Moreover,
          although the Son belongs to no genus of creatures, yet, as Basil
          holds, He has something in common with creatures: namely, the fact
          that He received from the Father that which He has; but this
          possession is superior to that of creatures, since through His own
          nature He possesses what He receives from the Father. On this account
          there can be noted a certain order between the generation of the Son
          and the production of creatures.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          9. It may be said: This saying and all sayings similar to it, which
          are read in regard to the wisdom of God, ought to be referred to the
          wisdom of creatures, such as the angels, or to Christ Himself
          according to His human nature. Thus His wisdom is said to be “from the
          beginning,” or “at the beginning of creation,” as if from eternity it
          predestined that creation should belong to Him.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          10. Answer may be made: As Augustine says in II <i>De Trinitate</i>:
          From the fact that the Father will glorify the Son, it does not follow
          that the Son is inferior to the Father; otherwise, He would be less
          than the Holy Spirit, because the Son says of the Holy Spirit in John
          16:14: “He shall glorify Me.” Now, this glorification refers not to
          the Person of the Son, but to the fact that in the knowledge of men He
          will be glorified, since the Spirit will make Him known; or it may be
          referred to the body which He had assumed and to the glory of the
          Resurrection.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          11. It may be said: The Son and the Holy Spirit are said to be “sent”
          by the Father, not that they now are where they had previously not
          been; but that, they are now there in a certain manner in which they
          had not previously been: that is to say, as regards a certain effect
          in creatures. Wherefore, when the Son and the Holy Spirit are said to
          have been sent by the Father, no inequality in the Trinity is
          revealed, but an order of origin, by which one Person is from another.
          Therefore the Father is not “sent,” because He is not from another in
          such a way that He has from another His efficacy in relation to any of
          His effects; and it is in this way that a divine Person is “sent.”

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Objections</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It seems that the cause of plurality cannot be otherness. For as is
          said in the <i>Arithmetica</i> of Boethius, all things whatever of the
          sum-total of beings that have been established in nature seem to ‘
          have been formed by reason of numbers. For this was the principal
          exemplar in the mind of the builder of the universe: and this is in
          agreement with what is said in Wis. 11:21, “You have disposed all
          things in weight and in number and in measure”. Therefore plurality or
          number is first among created things, and no cause of it is to be
          sought for.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. As said in the book <i>De causis</i>, the first of created things
          is being; but being is divided at first by one and many; hence nothing
          can exist as prior to multitude except being and unity. Therefore it
          does not seem to be true that anything else should be its cause.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Plurality either includes all genera according as it is
          distinguished from unity, which is convertible with being: or it is
          itself in the genus of quantity, according as it is distinguished from
          that unity which is the principle of number. But otherness is in the
          genus of relation, and relations are not causes of quantities, but
          rather the converse is true. Much less, then, is relation the cause of
          what is in every genus, because in that case it would be the cause of
          substance; therefore otherness can in no way be the cause of
          plurality.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. For contrary things there are contrary causes: but identity and
          otherness or diversity are opposites; therefore they have opposite
          causes. But unity is the cause of identity, as is evident in V
          <i>Metaph.</i>; therefore plurality or multitude is the cause of
          diversity; and consequently otherness is not the cause of plurality.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. The principle of otherness is accidental difference; for
          differences of this kind, according to Porphyry, make a thing other.
          But accidental difference is not found in all things in which there is
          plurality; in fact, in some cases there is no difference of any kind.
          Certain things, such as simple forms, cannot be subjects of accidents;
          and there are other things that agree in no way, so that they cannot
          be called different, but diverse, as is evident by the words of the
          Philosopher in X <i>Metaph</i>. Therefore otherness is not the cause
          of all plurality.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Sed contra</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But on the contrary is what Damascene says, that division is the cause
          of number; but division consists in diversity or otherness; therefore
          diversity, or otherness, is the principle of plurality.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, Isidore says that number is called, as it were, the master of
          numeration, that is, of division; and so the conclusion is like the
          first.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, plurality is not constituted except by recession from unity;
          but there is no loss of unity except by division, since a thing is
          said to be one in that it is undivided, as is evident from X Metaph.;
          therefore division constitutes plurality, and thus the conclusion is
          as before.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer that it must
          be said, as the Philosopher states in X <i>Metaph.</i>, that a thing
          is said to be plural (many) from the fact that it is divisible or has
          been divided. Wherefore anything that is the cause of division ought
          to be regarded as a cause of plurality.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now, the cause of division cannot be considered the same in posterior
          and composite beings as in those that are first and simple. For
          in’posterior and composite things, the cause of division which is, as
          it were, the formal cause of division by reason of which division
          comes about, is diversity found in more simple and primary beings, as
          is made clear in the case of division according to quantity. For one
          part of a line is divided from another part by the fact that they have
          each a different place, which is, as it were, the formal difference of
          a thing of continuous quantity having position. It is also evident in
          the division of substances. For man is different from an ass because
          he has diverse constitutive differences: but the diversity by which
          posterior, composite beings are divided according as prior and simpler
          beings are, presupposes plurality of these same primary and more
          simple beings. For the reason why man and ass have diverse differences
          is that ratipnality and irrationality are not one and the same thing,
          but differ in many ways. Nor can it be said endlessly that the
          plurality of one thing is owing to another diversity in another prior
          and simpler cause, because thus we would go on to infinity. Therefore
          it is necessary in some other way to assign a cause of plurality and
          division in prior and more simple beings.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now, there are some beings of this kind divided in themselves.
          Nevertheless it cannot be that being is divided from being, inasmuch
          as it is being: for nothing is divided from being except non-being.
          Likewise also from this-being, this-being is not divided, unless in
          this-being there is included negation of the same being. Wherefore in
          primary termini of thought negative propositions are immediately, as
          it were, negations, one of the other, in the intellect. For the first
          thing caused constitutes plurality with its cause, which does not
          reach to it [so as to be identical with it]. And according to this,
          certain philosophers hold that plurality is caused in a certain order
          from one and the selfsame thing; so that from one thing proceeds, at
          first, one being, which with its cause constitutes a plurality, and
          from this plurality, now two things can proceed, one according to the
          thing itself, and the other according to its conjunction to a cause.
          But we are not forced to say this, since one thing might be able to
          imitate the first in some way in which the second would fail to agree
          with it; and this defect could be imitated in another; and so there
          can be found many effects of the first cause in any number of which
          there is both negation of the cause and negation of the effects in the
          same way, or according to distance separating one from the other.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          So, therefore, it is evident that the first reason or, principle of
          plurality or division is from affirmation and negation, as the order
          of origin of such plurality is understood, because first there must be
          understanding of being and non-being, by which first divisions are
          constituted, and by this, there are the many.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Hence, just as first being, inasmuch as it is undivided, is
          immediately recognized as one, so after division of being and
          non-being there is immediate recognition of the plurality of first
          simple beings. The nature of diversity, moreover, follows upon
          plurality according as there remains in it the virtue of its cause,
          that is, the opposition of being and nonbeing. Therefore one of many
          diverse things is said to be related to another because it is not that
          other. And since a second cause does not produce its effect except by
          virtue of a first cause, therefore the plurality of first causes does
          not make division and plurality in secondary, composite beings unless
          there remains in that plurality the virtue of prime opposition, which
          is between being and non-being, by reason of which it has the nature
          of diversity; and thus the diversity of first causes produces the
          diversity of second.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          According to this, it is true, as Boethius says, that otherness is the
          principle of plurality. indeed, otherness is to be found in things
          because there is diversity among them. However, although division
          precedes plurality of first causes, diversity does not; because ‘
          division does not require the being of things divided among
          themselves, since division is by affirmation and negation, but
          diversity does require each to be a distinct being; wherefore it
          presupposes plurality. Hence it is in no way possible that the cause
          of the plurality of first beings should be diversity, unless diversity
          is employed as meaning division.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Boethius, therefore, is speaking of the plurality of composite beings,
          as is evident from the fact that he presents a proof involving those
          things that are diverse according to genus or species or number, and
          these kinds of diversity exist only in composite beings. For anything
          which is in a genus must be composed of genus and difference. Those,
          therefore, who declare the Father and Son to be unequal make
          declaration of composition, at least according to reason, inasmuch as
          they say the Father and Son agree in this, that they are God, but
          differ in the fact that they are unequal.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to objections</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It may be said: In these words, number is shown to be prior to
          other created things, such as the elements and other such beings; but
          it is not prior to other notions, such as affirmation and negation or
          division and the like. Moreover, not every kind of number is prior to
          all created beings, but only number which is the cause of each thing,
          namely, God Himself, who, according to Augustine, is Number, giving
          species to every creature.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. It may be answered: Plurality, commonly speaking, im,mediately
          follows upon being; but this is not necessarily true of all plurality,
          and so it is not unfitting that the plurality of posterior beings
          should be caused by the diversity of those that are prior.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. It may be said: As one and many are not properly of one genus, so
          neither are the same and the diverse, but they are passiones of being
          inasmuch as it is being, and hence there is no difficulty if the
          diversity of certain beings causes the plurality of others.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. It may be said: Some kind of plurality precedes all diversity, but
          diversity does not precede all plurality, yet some kind of diversity
          precedes certain plurality. Hence two things are equally true: namely,
          that, commonly speaking, multitude produces diversity, as the
          Philosopher says; and that diversity in composite things produces
          plurality, as Boethius here declares.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It may be answered: Boethius is using “otherness” in place of
          “diversity,” which is constituted by certain differences, whether they
          are accidental or substantial. But those beings that are diverse yet
          not different are first beings, and Boethius is here not speaking of
          them.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It seems that variety of accidents cannot be the cause of plurality
          according to number. For the Philosopher says in V <i>Metaph.</i> that
          those things are numerically one in which the matter is one; therefore
          they are numerically plural in which the matter is plural; therefore
          variety of accidents does not produce diversity in number, but rather
          diversity of matter does so.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. As the Philosopher says in IV <i>Metaph.</i>, the cause of the
          substance and of the unity in things is the same; but accidents are
          not the cause either of the substance or of the unity in the
          individual; consequently they cannot be the cause of numerical
          plurality.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. All accidents, since accidents are indeed forms, are themselves
          communicable or common and universal: but nothing of this kind can be
          the cause of individuation in another, or a principle of
          individuation; therefore accidents cannot be principles of
          individuation. But certain things are diverse according to number
          inasmuch as they are divided in their own individuation; therefore
          accidents cannot be causes of diversity according to number.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. As those things that are in a genus or a species differ according
          to their substance, and not only according to an accident, so also
          those things that differ according to number must do likewise; but
          certain things are said to be diverse in genus or in species by reason
          of what is in the genus of substance, and not according to their
          accidents; therefore, in like manner, things are said to be
          numerically diverse according to what is in the genus of substance,
          and not according to accidents.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. If a cause is removed, so is its effect. Now it happens that every
          accident is removed from a subject either actually or by thought. If,
          therefore, an accident were the principle of plurality according to
          number and diversity, it would happen that the same things would
          sometimes be numerically one and sometimes diverse, either actually or
          by thought.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. What is posterior is never the cause of what is prior. But among
          all accidents, quantity holds first place, as Boethius says in
          <i>Lib. praedicam</i>. Among quantities, however, number is prior
          since it is more simple and more abstract. Therefore an accident
          cannot be the principle of plurality according to number.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Sed contra</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          On the contrary is the statement made byy Porphyry, that a collection
          of accidents which are not to be found in another produces the
          individual. But what is the principle of individuation is the
          principle of numerical plurality; therefore accidents are the
          principle of plurality according to number.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, in the individual, there is found nothing except matter, form,
          and accidents. Diversity of form, however, does not produce diversity
          according to number, but according to species, as is said in X
          <i>Metaph</i>. Now, diversity of matter produces diversity of genus.
          For the Philosopher says in X <i>Metaph.</i> that those things differ
          in genus in which there is not common matter, or generation of one
          into the other (mutual generation). Therefore diversity according to
          number cannot be produced except by diversity of accidents.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, what is found as common in many things that are specifically
          different is not the cause of diversity according to number, because
          the division of genus into species precedes the division of species
          into individuals; but matter is found to be common in things that are
          different in species because the same matter is possessed by contrary
          forms, otherwise beings having contrary forms would not be transmuted
          one into the other; therefore matter is not the principle of
          individuation according to number, and neither is form, as has been
          noted at the beginning. Hence it remains that accidents are the cause
          of this kind of diversity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, in the genus of substance there is found only genus and
          difference; but the individuals of one species differ neither in
          genus, nor by reason of substantial differences; therefore they do not
          differ except because of accidental differences.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer: For the
          clarification of this question and of those other questions treated of
          in the text of Boethius, it is necessary to see what may be the cause
          of the threefold diversity spoken of in the text.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now, since in the individual composite in the genus of substance there
          are only three things (matter, form, and the composite), it must be
          that in each of these things the causes of their diversities are to be
          found. Accordingly it must be evident that diversity of genus is
          reduced to diversity of matter; but diversity according to species is
          reduced to diversity of form; whereas diversity according to number is
          owing partly to diversity of matter, and partly to accidental
          diversity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Since, moreover, genus is the principle for knowableness of a thing,
          inasmuch as it is the first part of a definition, though matter in
          itself is unknowable, it is not possible that from matter in se
          diversity of genus should be known, but only according to that mode by
          which it is knowable. Now, a thing is knowable in two ways. (1) In one
          way, by analogy, or by comparison, as is said in I <i>Physic</i>. Thus
          we say that this is matter or that matter is related to natural things
          as wood is to a couch. (2) In another way, a thing is known by the
          form because of which it has actual being. For everything is known
          inasmuch as it is in act, not according as it is in potency, as is
          said in X <i>Metaph.</i>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          According to this aspect, diversity of genus derives from matter in
          two ways. (1) In one way, by analogous diversity in relation to form,
          and thus the first genera of things are distinguished according to
          matter. For what is in the genus of substance is referred to matter as
          to a part of itself; but what is in the genus of quantity has no
          matter as a part of itself, but is related to it as its measure, and
          quality is related as its disposition. And by means of these two
          genera (namely, quantity and quality), all other genera are diversely
          related to matter, which is a part of substance; hence substance has
          the nature of a subject and as such has a certain relation to
          accidents. (2) In another way, diversity of genus has its, origin in
          matter inasmuch as matter is perfected by form. And since matter is
          pure potency, just as God is Pure Act, to say that matter is perfected
          by act (which is form) is to say nothing else than that in some way it
          shares in a certain similitude to First Act, imperfectly indeed, since
          what is composed of matter and form is midway between pure potency and
          pure act.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, matter does not receive similitude to First Act in an
          altogether equal way, but in some things it is received imperfectly
          and in others more perfectly; thus, for example, some beings
          participate in a divine similitude inasmuch only as they subsist;
          others, in that they have knowledge; and still others, by possession
          of intellect. Therefore what is the similitude of First Act in any
          existing matter is its form. But in some beings this form causes it
          only to exist, in others to exist and to live, and so, in one and the
          same being, form may be the cause of other perfections. For what is
          the more perfect similitude has everything that less perfect
          similitudes have by way of perfections, and more besides. Something
          common, therefore, may be found in various similitudes, but possessed
          more imperfectly in some and more perfectly in cothers; just as matter
          may be subjected to both act and privation. And so matter, once taken
          together with this common element, is still material in regard to the
          aforementioned perfection and imperfection. From this material element
          it takes its genus, but its difference is from the perfection or
          imperfection of which we spoke above. For example, frorp this common
          material element (namely, having life), there is derived the genus
          “animated body”; but because of a superadded perfection there derives
          the difference “sensible,” while, on the other hand, from imperfection
          there is derived the difference “insensible.” Thus the diversity of
          such material things brings about diversity of genus, as that between
          animal and plant. On this account matter is said to be the principle
          of diversity according to genus, and in the same way, form is the
          principle of diversity according to species; because it is by reason
          of formal qualities which material things possess in addition to those
          which are the cause of their genus as material things, or by relation
          of form to matter, that the differences constituting species are
          derived.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          However, it must be borne in mind that this “matter” whence genus is
          derived has in itself both form and matter. While the logician
          considers genus only according to its formal aspect, his definitions
          are said to be formal; but the natural philosopher considers genus
          from both aspects. Hence it sometimes happens that a thing shares in a
          logical genus in which it would not be classed according to the
          natural philosopher. Now, this happens when something by way of
          similitude to First Act is found in a material thing, and again in one
          without matter, and again in a being altogether different in matter.
          Thus it is evident that a stone which is in matter in such a way as to
          be potential to being, attains to something of similitude to First Act
          by being subsistent, and the sun also attains to the same similitude,
          though being in matter which is potential to place, but not any longer
          to being (having subsistent existence); and an angel likewise,
          although lacking any kind of matter. Hence the logician, finding in
          all these beings that from which a genus derives, places them all in
          the genus of substance; but the natural philosopher and the
          metaphysician, who considers the principles of things, not finding
          these all to be in material agreement, says that they differ in genus;
          as is said in X <i>Metaph.</i>: that corruptible and incorruptible
          differ generically and that those beings agree in genus whose matter
          is one and among which there is mutual generation.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Thus therefore it is evident in what way matter produces diversity in
          genus, and form produces diversity in species. But among individuals
          of the same species diversity should be considered, according to that
          laid down by the Philosopher (VII <i>Metaph.</i>); namely, that just
          as parts of genus and species are matter and form, so the parts of the
          individual are this matter and this form. Therefore, just as diversity
          of matter causes diversity in genus, or diversity of form causes
          diversity in species, absolutely, so this form and this matter produce
          diversity in number: but no form, as such, is of itself. I say,
          however, “no form, as such,” because of the rational soul, which in a
          manner is this something of itself, but not merely inasmuch as it is a
          form. Intellect, in truth, since it is a form capable of being
          received into anything—as its matter, or as its subject—can naturally
          be attributed to many; a thing which is contrary to the nature of that
          which is this something; hence it is, made a form by the fact that it
          is received in matter. But since matter, considered in itself, is
          indistinct, it is not possible that it would individuate a form
          received into it, except as it is distinguishable. For no form is
          individuated by the fact that it is received into’matter, except in so
          far as it is received into this matter, or it is this distinct form,
          determined to this, and at this time.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, matter is not divisible except by quantity. Therefore the
          Philosopher says in I <i>Physic.</i>, that if quantity were removed, a
          substance would remain indivisible: hence matter is made to be this
          matter and is signate inasmuch as it exists under dimensions.
          Dimensions, however, can be considered in two ways.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. In one way according to their termination, and I say that they are
          terminated according to limited measure and figure; and so, as
          complete beings, dimensions are classed in the genus of quantity, and
          thus they cannot be the principle of individuation: because such
          termination of dimensions may frequently vary in regard to the same
          individual, and in such case it would follow that the individual would
          not remain numerically the same.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. In another way, dimensions may be considered without this certain
          determination, merely in the nature of dimension, although they never
          could exist without some kind of determination; just as the nature of
          color cannot exist without determination to white or black; and
          according to this aspect dimensions are classed in the genus of
          quantity as imperfect. And by these indeterminate dimensions matter is
          made to be this signate matter, and thus gives individuality to a
          form, and thus also by matter there is caused the numerical diversity
          of things in the same species.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Therefore it is evident that matter, according as it is considered in
          itself, is not the principle of diversity, either according to species
          or according to number; but as it is the principle of generic
          diversity inasmuch as it is considered the subject of a common form,
          so it is the principle of numerical diversity inasmuch as it is
          considered as subject to indeterminate dimensions. Therefore also,
          since these dimensions are in the genus of accidents, diversity
          according to number is reduced to diversity of matter, or to
          accidental diversity, according to the nature of the aforesaid
          dimensions. Other accidents, however, are not principles of
          individuation, but they are the principle of knowing the individual to
          be distinct. In this way individuation is also attributed to other
          accidents.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to objections</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It may be said: When the Philosopher says that those things are
          numerically one in which the matter is one, this must be understood of
          signate matter which is the subject of dimensions; otherwise it would
          be necessary to say that all generable and corruptible things are
          numerically one, since their matter is one.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. It may be answered: Since dimensions are accidents, they cannot per
          se be the principle of the unity of an individual substance; but
          matter, inasmuch as it underlies such and such dimensions, is
          understood to be the principle of this unity and of this multitude.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. It may be said: It is according to the nature of an individual
          thing that it be undivided in itself, and divided from other things by
          an ultimate division. No accident, however, has in itself the proper
          nature of division, unless it is quantity; therefore dimensions of
          themselves have a certain nature of individuation according to a
          determined place, inasmuch as place is a difference of quantity. Thus
          there is a twofold meaning of individuation: the one on the part of a
          subject, and this is the same for any accident; the other meaning, on
          the part of individuation itself, inasmuch as it has place, by reason
          of which, in abstracting from sensible matter, we may imagine this
          line and this circle. Hence it rightly pertains to matter to
          individuate all other forms, because it gives to this form, which of
          itself has the nature of individuation, that it also be terminated by
          those dimensions that are found in a subject now made complete;
          accordingly they are individuated by matter which is individuated by
          indeterminate dimensions conceived of as in matter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. It may be said: Things that differ numerically in the genus of
          substance, differ not dinly because of accidents, but also by reason
          of form and matter; but if it is asked how this form differs from
          that, the only reason can be that it is in other signate matter. Nor
          can there be found another reason why this matter is divided from that
          except by reason of its quantity. Hence matter subject to dimension is
          undersiood to be the principle of this kind of diversity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It may be said: This reasoning relates to completed accidents which
          follow upon the existence of a form in matter; but not to those
          indeterminate dimensions which may be conceived of before the
          reception of the form in matter. For without these, a thing cannot be
          understood to be ‘ individual, any more than it can be conceived of
          without form.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. It may be answered: Number, formally speaking, is prior to
          continuous quantity: but materially, continuous quantity is prior,
          since number is the result of the division of a continuum, as is said
          in IV Physic. In this way, division of matter, according to
          dimensions, causes numerical diversity.

          1. It seems that two bodies can be conceived of as being in the same
          place. For any proposition seems to be intelligible in which there is
          included no opposition of the predicate to the subject, since such a
          proposition contains nothing repugnant to understanding. But this
          proposition, “Two bodies are in the same place,” is not a proposition
          repugnant to the intellect. Otherwise it could not happen
          miraculously, a thing evidently false regarding the body of our Lord,
          which came forth from the closed womb of the Virgin, and which entered
          into the midst of the disciples, the doors being shut. Now, even God
          cannot cause affirmation and negation to be simultaneously true, as
          Augustine says in answer to Faustus; therefore one can understand, or
          at least conceive of in his mind, that two bodies could be in the same
          place at the same time.

          2. From glorified bodies there will be removed not the nature of
          corporeity, but only that of <i>corpulentia</i> (bodily mass). When
          this is removed, the possibility of being with other bodies in the
          same place is theirs by reason of the gift of subtlety, as is said by
          many. Therefore this condition does not follow the nature of
          corporeity, but that of corpulentia, of a certain mass. Therefore it
          is not impossible to conceive of two bodies being simultaneously in
          the same place.

          as holding first place among corporeal things; but light is
          simultaneously in the same place with air; therefore two bodies can be
          in the same place at the same time. Any species of fire, as the
          Philosopher says in V <i>Topic.</i>, is a body; and so the conclusion
          is like the previous one.

          would not follow the motion of a dominant element; but all four
          elements are bodies and are simultaneously in every part of the

          7. The fact that two bodies are not simultaneously in one place does
          not occur by reason of the matter of the bodies, since to matter in
          itself there is no due place; nor does it occur because of the form,
          for the same reason; nor is it because of dimension, since dimensions
          do not fill up place, as is evident from the fact that certain
          philosophers are accustomed to say that the place where there are only
          dimensions is a vacuum. Therefore this characteristic of a body must
          arise only from certain posterior accidents, which are not altogether
          common and which can be separated from the body; and so it seems that
          two bodies could be simultaneously in the same place.

          the planets move in epicycles, which are circles intersecting the
          spheres extrinsic to the planets. Therefore it must be that a body of
          a planet at some time would arrive at the place of section. But it
          cannot be said that at that place there is any vacuum, since nature
          does not suffer this; nor that the substance of the spheres is
          divisible, so that it might be thought of as giving way when the
          planetary body had reached it, as air gives way to a stone, for the
          heavens are most solid, being formed, as it were, of molten brass, as
          is said in Job, 37:18. Therefore it must be that the body of the
          planet is simultaneously in the same place as the body of the sphere;
          and so Boethius falsely says that two bodies cannot occupy one and the
          same place.

          On the contrary is the fact that if two bodies are in one and the same
          place, they are the same in nature and in every respect; but any body,
          however large, can be divided into small bodies of any quantity,
          according to any number; therefore, it would follow that in the very
          smallest place there would be contained the largest body, a thing
          which appears to be absurd.

          Again, it is impossible for there to be many straight lines between
          two given points. But this would follow if two bodies could be in the
          same place. For then, given two points in two opposite parts of space,
          there will be between them two straight lines assigned corporeally to
          two places. Now, it cannot be said that between these two points there
          will be no lines at all, or that a line of one location would be
          greater than the other, or that there could be any one line apart from
          those corporeally located between the two points of given location,
          for in that case the two lines would not be in a subject. Therefore it
          is impossible for two bodies to be simultaneously in the same place.

          Again, it has been demonstrated in geometry that two circles are
          tangent only at one point: but if we posit two bodies being
          simultaneously in the same place, it would follow that two circles
          could be totally tangent. Therefore it is impossible that two bodies
          should be in the same place at the same time.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, whatever things are equal to one and the same thing are equal
          to each other; but since local dimension must be one with a localized
          body (since no dimension can be supposed without a subject), if two
          bodies could be simultaneously in the same place, it would follow that
          the dimensions of each body would be equal to the dimensions of the
          place; therefore it would follow that the bodies would be the same,
          but this is impossible.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer that it must
          be said that in those things belonging to our world, all of which are
          judged to be corporeal, we see from sense experience that when one
          body arrives at any given place, any other body is expelled from that
          place; therefore it is experimentally evident that two such bodies
          cannot be in the same place.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          There are, however, certain philosophers who declare that two bodies
          are not thus prohibited from simultaneous occupation of the same place
          on account of their corporeity, or on account of anything else which
          belongs to the nature of a body, as a body, for thus it would follow
          that it would be altogether impossible for two bodies to exist
          simultaneously [in the same place]. But they say that this prohibition
          is due only to their <i>corpulentia</i>. But whatever this
          <i>corpulentia</i> may mean—whether density or impurity or
          corruptibility which attends certain bodies, or even some special
          nature superadded to the general nature of corporeity—the prohibition
          can be on account of none of these things.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now, there is to be found a double relation of a body to place. One is
          according as it has location in this or that determined place; and
          this relationship follows upon the specific nature of this or that
          body, just as heavy things, by the very nature of their gravity, hold
          a lower place, but light bodies, a higher place.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But another relationship prevails according as a body is said,
          absolutely, to be in place: and this relationship characterizes a
          bodily thing by the very nature of its corporeity, not because of
          anything additional. For according as a particular body is in place,
          it is commensurate with that place; but this is because it has
          dimensions that are equal and similar to the dimensions of the place;
          moreover, dimensions belong to every body by reason of its very
          corporeity. For, that many bodies should or should not be in the same
          place, has no relation to a determined place, but regards place
          absolutely; therefore it must be that the cause of this impediment
          should be referred to the nature of corporeity, by reason of which
          every body, inasmuch as it is a body, is destined to be in place.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          And if the last sphere should not be in place, this is so only because
          nothing can be outside it, but not because it is lacking in the
          aforesaid aptitude to occupy place.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Hence there are others who concede that, absolutely, no two bodies can
          be in the same place at the same time, and they assign the reason for
          this to mathematical principles, which ought to be observed in all the
          natural sciences, as is said in III <i>Coel. et mun</i>. But this
          reason does not seem fitting, because it does not pertain to the
          objects of mathematics to be in place, except improperly and by
          similitude, as is said in II <i>De generatione</i>. Hence, the reason
          for maintaining this impediment should not be derived from
          mathematical principles, but from the principles of natural things, to
          which place is properly due. Furthermore, mathematical reasoning is
          sufficiently conclusive only in regard to its own matter. For,
          although mathematical truths are preserved in natural sciences, beings
          of the natural order add something over and above what is possessed
          by, mathematical beings: namely, sensible matter; and because of this
          addition it is possible to assign as an explanation of something in
          the natural order what would not be assigned in explanation of an
          object of mathematics. For in mathematics no reason for diversity of
          two given lines can be assigned except because of their situation;
          wherefore, if diversity of situation is removed, there remains no
          plurality of mathematical lines, and likewise no diversity of surfaces
          or of bodies. On this account mathematical bodies cannot be both many
          and simultaneous, and in like manner neither can lines or surfaces.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But in regard to corporeal things in nature, it is possible to assign
          another and different reason for diversity: namely, that of sensible
          matter, even though diversity of situation were removed. Hence the
          reasoning which proves that two mathematical bodies cannot be
          simultaneously in the same place does not suffice for proving that two
          bodies in the natural order could not be simultaneous. And therefore
          the explanation of Avicenna must be accepted, which he uses in his
          <i>Sufficientia</i>, in the treatise <i>De loco</i>. In this
          explanation he assigns as reason of the aforesaid prohibition one
          which, by natural principles, is owing to the very nature of
          corporeity itself. For he says there can be no cause of this
          prohibition except that it pertains, first and per se, to a thing to
          be in place: but this means that it is destined by its nature to fill
          a place. Moreover, it does not pertain to a form to be in place,
          except accidentally; although certain forms are the principles by
          which a body is inclined to this or that place. Likewise neither does
          it pertain to matter, considered per se, to be in place, because, as
          so considered, it is understood apart from all genera, as is said in
          VII <i>Metaph</i>. Wherefore it must be that matter, according as it
          is subject to that by which it has primary relation to place, is the
          cause of this prohibition; but it is related to place inasmuch as it
          is subject to dimensions: hence it is by nature of matter subject to
          dimensions that many bodies are prohibited from being in the same
          place.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          For, wherever the form of corporeity is found to be divided, there
          must be a plurality of bodies; but this division does not take place
          except by division of matter. Since division of matter is only by
          dimensions, because of which matter has situation, it is impossible
          that this matter should be distinct from that unless it is distinct
          according to situation. But this would not be the case if two bodies
          were posited as being in the same place; for then they would not be
          two bodies but one body, a thing which is impossible. Since,
          therefore, matter subject to dimensions is found in all corporeal
          things, it must be by reason of the very nature of corporeity that any
          two bodies are prohibited from being in the same place at the same
          time.

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. It may be said: A proposition may be called not-intelligible in two
          ways. In one way, it may be on the part of the one understanding,
          because of the deficiency of his intellect, as is the case in relation
          to this proposition: “In the three divine Persons there is one
          essence.” In a proposition of this kind, there can be, indeed, no
          contradiction.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In another way, non-intelligibility may be on the part of the
          proposition, and this again for two reasons. In one way because it
          implies a contradiction, absolutely, as for example, “The rational is
          irrational”; and not even by a miracle can propositions of this sort
          be made true. In another way, because they imply a contradiction in a
          certain manner, as this proposition: “The dead man rose to life by his
          own (proper) power”; for, by the fact that he is said to be “dead,” it
          is posited that he is destitute of every principle of life.
          Propositions of this kind can be made true by the miraculous operation
          of a superior power; and such is the case in regard to this
          proposition. For just as there can be found no natural cause of
          diversity for two bodies in the same place, so, by divine power, it is
          possible that two bodies be in the same place and that, although
          united in situation, their, distinction be conserved, as does
          miraculously happen.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. It may be said: Whatever may be this <i>corpulentia</i>, which is
          said to be removed from glorified bodies, nevertheless it is evident
          that corporeity will not be removed from them; therefore, neither will
          the cause which naturally prohibits any one of them from
          simultaneously occupying the same place with another; but only by a
          miracle is it possible that a glorified body be in the same place
          simultaneously with other bodies.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. It may be answered: Light is not a body, but a certain quality, as
          Damascene says, and Avicenna also. But Augustine gives light the same
          name as fire, as is evident from the fact that he speaks of light as
          contradistinguished from air, water, and earth.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. It may be answered: The three species of fire spoken of by the
          Philosopher are to be understood in such a way that by “light” is
          understood fire existing in its proper matter, and granted also, as
          some say, that fire in its own proper sphere emits no light. For it
          does not belong to the nature of light to be luminous, but by
          participation in it other things become so. The same is true of fire:
          for, although in its own sphere it emits no light, nevertheless, by
          participation in it, other things become refulgent. By flame, however,
          is to be understood fire in the air; and by carbo, fire in terrestrial
          matter. In aqueous matter, however, fire cannot continue in such a way
          as to have the nature of fire, because water has qualities which are
          altogether opposed to fire.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It must be said: In iron which has become ignited there are not two
          bodies, but one body having indeed the species of iron, but certain
          properties of fire.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. It may be answered: Although elements in a compound are supposed to
          remain according to their substantial forms, nevertheless it is not
          supposed that there are then many bodies in act, for otherwise no
          compound would be truly one; but while it is potentially many, it is
          one in act.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Nevertheless the opinion of the Commentator, III <i>Coel. et mun.</i>,
          seems the more probable. In rejecting the opinion of Avicenna, he says
          that the forms of elements neither remain in a compound nor are
          altogether corrupted, but that from them there comes to be one common
          or neuter form inasmuch as they comprise it, more or less. But since
          to give rise to a substantial form “more or less” seems an
          improbability, it appears that this saying ought to be understood in
          this way: that the forms of the elements are receptive of more or less
          (or comprise the form of the compound, more or less), not secundum se,
          but according as they remain in elementary qualities, as it were in
          their proper instruments. And thus it is said: Forms remain virtually
          in the qualities of the elements certain instrumental properties, as
          it were. Forms secundum se, do not remain, but only according as they
          remain virtually in their qualities, out of which there is made one,
          median, or common quality.

          7. It may be said: Although dimensions of themselves cannot fill out a
          place, nevertheless a natural body, because of the fact that its
          matter is understood to be subject to dimensions, has the natural
          characteristic of filling a place.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          8. It may be said: The opinion of Ptolemy regarding epicycles and
          eccentrics does not seem consonant with principles of natural
          philosophy which Aristotle holds; hence this opinion is not acceptable
          to the followers of Aristotle. If, however, it should be sustained, no
          necessity arises for supposing two bodies to be in the same place
          since, according to those who hold this opinion, the substances of
          heavenly bodies are distinguished as of three kinds: namely, the
          substance of the stars, which is luminous; the substance of the
          spheres, which is diaphanous and solid, but not divisible; and another
          kind of substance, which is between the spheres, and which is
          divisible and of resisting density, after the manner of the air,
          although this substance is incorruptible. And thus those who hold the
          theory of this third substance have no need to say that the substance
          of the spheres is divided or that two bodies occupy the same place
          simultaneously.

          1. It seems that variety of location effects nothing as regards
          diversity according to number. For the cause of diversity acicording
          to number is in those things which differ numerically; but place is
          outside things that are located; therefore diversity of place cannot
          be the cause of numerical diversity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. A thing is not complete in being unless it is distinct from others;
          but place comes after complete being; therefore motion to a place is
          the motion of that which is perfect according to substance, as is said
          in IX <i>Physic</i>. Therefore it is not possible that any cause of
          the distinction of bodies occupying space should be derived from
          place.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Numerical distinction is invariable as regards things that are
          distinct: but an invariable effect cannot proceed from a variable
          cause; therefore, since place varies in regard to that having
          location, it is not possible for diversity according to place to be
          the cause of numerical diversity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. If a cause is removed, so also is its effect: but it sometimes
          happens by a miracle that distinction of place is removed in respect
          to two bodies, as has been previously said; yet distinction according
          to number is not removed; therefore distinction according to place is
          not the cause of numerical diversity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. Diversity according to number is found not only in corporeal
          things, but even in incorporeal substances; but in these latter,
          diversity according to place cannot be the cause of numerical
          diversity, since incorporeal beings are not in a place, as Boethius
          himself says in his book, <i>De hebdomadibus</i>; therefore diversity
          according to place cannot be taken as the cause of diversity according
          to number, that is, as its cause by very reason of its nature, as he
          himself seems to say.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Sed contra</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          On the contrary is the fact that things differing according to number
          differ by reason of their accidents: but the diversity of no other
          accident is so inseparablv related to diversity in number as is
          diversity of location; therefore diversity in place seems especially
          to influence diversity in number.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, diversity of location according to the species of things is
          concomitant with the diversity of bodies according to their species,
          as is evident in the case of heavy and light bodies. Therefore also
          diversity of places according to number is indivisibly concomitant
          with diversity of bodies according to number, and so the conclusion is
          the same as before.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Again, as time is the measure of motion, so place is the measure of a
          body: but motion is divided numerically according to time, as is said
          in V <i>Physic.</i>; therefore also what is corporeal is divided
          numerically according to place.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Response.</span> I answer: It must be
          said that, as is evident from previous statements, diversity according
          to number is caused by division of matter existing under dimensions.
          Now, matter itself, according as it exists under dimensions, prohibits
          two bodies from being in the same place, inasmuch as in each of the
          two bodies there must be matter distinct in its situation. And thus it
          is evident that diversity according to number is caused by the same
          thing as diversity of location in diverse bodies. Hence diversity of
          location, considered in itself, is a sign of the diversity which
          exists according to number—just as is also true of other accidents,
          except the first indeterminate dimensions which have been previously
          discussed. But if diversity of place is considered according to its
          own cause, then it is clear that diversity of place is the cause of
          diversity according to number. Therefore Boethius says it is variety
          of accidents that produces diversity according to number. But if all
          other accidents are removed, numerical diversity still remains
          verifiable by reason of the diversity of things in place; since,
          indeed, no other of those accidents which appear as extrinsic to a
          complete being is so closely related to the cause of diversity
          according to number as is diversity of location.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Answers to objections. 1-3. To the first, second, and third objections
          it may be said: These reasons show conclusively that diversity of
          place is not the cause of diversity of individuals, secundum se., but
          this does not refute the fact that the cause of diversity of locations
          is the cause of diversity according to number.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. It may be answered: All effects of second causes depend more on God
          than on secondary causes, since either with these second causes, or
          without them, He is able to produce miraculously whatever effects He
          wills.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. It may be said: In corporeal substances diversity according to
          species follows diversity according to number, except in the case of
          the rational soul, which follows division of matter disposed for it.
          Here, however, Boethius is speaking of diversity according to number
          where the species is the same.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Further answers</span>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. In contradiction to the first objection, it may be said: Variety of
          accidents, because of indeterminate dimensions, does not produce
          diversity in number after the manner of a cause, but this variety is
          said to produce, a sign indicating numerical diversity; and diversity
          of place does this in a special way, inasmuch as it is the sign, most
          closely related to numerical diversity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. To the second, it may be answered: Diversity of locations according
          to species is a sign of diversity of bodies according to their
          species, but not a cause of specific diversity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. To the third, it may be said: Although division of time is caused
          by division of motion, diversity, even diversity of time is not the
          cause of diversity of motion, but a sign of it; and the same is true
          of location in its relation to a body.

          1.2. <i>Speculative science</i> may be divided into three kinds:

          1.2.1.1 <i>Physics</i> deals with motion and is not abstract or
          separable; for it is concerned with forms of bodies together with
          their constituent matter, which forms cannot be separated in reality
          from their bodies. As bodies are in motion—the earth, for instance,
          tending downward, and fire tending upward—form takes on the movementof
          the particular thing to which it is annexed.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.2.1.2 <i>Mathematics</i> does not deal with motion and is not

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.1 Boethius has previously set forth the doctrine of the Catholic
          faith regarding the unity of the Trinity, and indicated the reason of
          this belief. Now he intends to proceed to an investigation of the
          aforesaid doctrine. Since, according to the opinion of the Philosopher
          in II <i>Metaph.</i>, inquiry into the method of a science ought to
          precede science itself, he therdore divides this section into two
          parts. In the first place Boethius points out the method proper for
          this kind of inquiry, which is concerned with divine things. In the
          second place he proceeds, according to the method he has indicated, to
          inquire into the proposition determined upon, where he says, “Which
          form, indeed.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The first part is again divided into two sections: first. he indicates
          the necessity of making clear the method of investigation. Secondly,
          he shows that the method of the present inquiry is suitable, saying:
          “Speculative science may be divided into three kinds.” Therefore he
          says: “Wherefore it is certain that this is the doctrine of the
          Catholic faith regarding the unity of the Trinity, and the nature of
          that unity without difference.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Thereupon, he says by way of exhortation, “Let us now begin,” that is,
          let us inquire more deeply, carrying our investigation to an
          examination of the intimate principle of things and of truth which is,
          as it were, veiled and hidden away from view. And that method which he
          deems fitting is indicated by the words: “Let us now begin a careful
          consideration of each several point, as far as it can be grasped and
          understood,” that is, according to the mode by which. understanding
          and apprehension are possible. Moreover, he uses the two words
          (“grasped” and “understood”) because the method of any investigation
          ought to be in harmony both with things and with us. For if it is not
          suited to the matter, things will not be understood; and if it is not
          suited to us, we shall not be able to apprehend the matter; for
          example, divine things are such by their very nature that they cannot
          be known except by intellect. Wherefore, if anyone wished to follow
          another way and to use imagination instead, he would not be able to
          understand anything of them as a result of his consideration, because
          truths, of this kind are not thus to be known. But if, on the other
          hand, one wished to know divine things so as to see them in
          themselves, and to comprehend them with the same certitude with which
          sensible things or mathematical demonstrations are comprehended, this
          too would be impossible; even things which are, in themselves,
          understandable in this way cannot be perfectly grasped because of the
          weakness of our intellect.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          He also shows that the mode of inquiry used must always correspond to
          the kind of investigation undertaken, by reference to the authority of
          the Philosopher in I <i>Ethic.</i> when he says: “For it has been
          wisely said that it is a scholar’s duty to formulate his belief about
          anything according to its real nature.” So, in regard to a doctrine of
          faith, the same principle must be applied: for in all cases, equal
          certitude and demonstrative evidence cannot be demanded. And these are
          the very words of the Philosopher in I <i>Ethic.</i>: “It is the duty
          of the scholar to demand as much certitude in his investigation of
          each thing as the nature of that thing permits.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.2 In the second place, when he says: “Speculative science may be
          divided into three kinds,” he inquires into the method of his own
          investigation, testing its congruousness by distinguishing it from the
          methods employed in other sciences; and, since method ought to
          correspond to the matter under investigation, he therefore divides
          this part of his consideration into two sections.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          First, he distinguishes sciences according to the matter with which
          each is concerned. Secondly, he indicates the methods suitable for
          each kind of matter, beginning, “Physics deals.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In regard to the first point, he does three things. First, he shows
          what the objects of natural philosophy are. Secondly, he indicates the
          objects of mathematics. Thirdly, he speaks of the truths with which
          divine science is concerned, when he says: “Theology does not.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.2.1.1 Therefore he says: “It has been wisely said that it is a
          scholar’s duty to formulate his belief about anything according to its
          real nature.” For, since there are three divisions of speculative
          science (or philosophy), and he calls it “speculative” to
          differentiate it from ethics, which is operative or practical; in each
          of these the method must be in conformity with the matter. The three
          divisions of speculative science indicated are physics or natural
          science, mathematics, and divine science or theology. While, I say,
          there are three divisions, natural philosophy, which is one of the,
          three, “deals with motion and,is not abstract,” that is, it is
          concerned with things in motion and not abstracted from matter. This
          he proves by examples, as is evident in his treatise. When, however,
          he says: “Form takes on the movement of the particular thing to which
          it is annexed,” his words should be understood as follows: that what
          is composite of matter and form, inasmuch as it is due the nature of a
          thing of this kind, has motion; or, in other words, a form existing in
          matter is the principle of motion. Therefore the consideration of
          things that are material and of things that are in motion is the same.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.2.1.2 He then indicates the subject matter of mathematics, saying:
          “Mathematics does not deal with motion”; that is, it involves no
          consideration of motion or of movable things, and on this point it
          differs from natural philosophy. Mathematics, moreover, is said to be
          “not abstract”; that is, it considers forms which according to their
          existence are not abstract from matter, and in this respect it is in
          agreement with natural philosophy. He then explains. how this is:
          Mathematics considers forms which are without matter and hence without
          motion, because wherever there is matter there is motion, as is proved
          in X <i>Metaph</i>. For according as things have matter there will
          also be motion, and thus the speculations of a mathematician are
          without matter and without motion, although these forms, namely, those
          about which the mathematician speculates, “being connected with
          matter, cannot really be separated from bodies,” according to their
          being [real existence]; but according to speculation, they can be
          considered as separable.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.2.1.3 Then he indicates the objects of divine science, calling it,
          ‘theology,” that is, the third division of speculative science, which
          is termed divine, or metaphysics, or first philosophy; and it deals
          with objects apart from motion, in which it agrees with mathematics
          and differs from natural philosophy. It also is “abstract,” namely,
          from matter, and “inseparable”; and because of these two facts it
          differs from mathematics. For the objects of divine science are of
          themselves abstract from matter and motion, but those of mathematics
          are not thus naturally abstract, but separable in thought. The objects
          of divine science, however, are called “inseparable” because a thing
          is not separable unless there is some conjunction with matter. Hence
          the objects of divine science are not separable from matter by
          thought, but are abstract according to their very being; while the
          converse is true in the case of the objects of mathematics. This he
          proves by the fact that the substance with which divine science is
          principally concerned is that of God, and on this account it is called
          “divine.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.2.2.1 In the next place, when he says, “In physics, then, we are
          bound to use scientific concepts, in mathematics systematic concepts,
          in theology intellectual concepts.” He points out the methods that
          correspond to the aforesaid divisions. Here he treats of two things.
          First, he draws conclusions about the methods appropriate for each of
          the divisions named, and the disposition of this section is left open
          for discussion. Secondly, he describes the last mode, which is that
          proper to the present investigation, and indicates a twofold
          procedure: first, by the removal of that which is an impediment to
          speculation saying, ‘In theology we will not let ourselves be diverted
          to play with imaginations (that is, in such a way that in formulating
          judgments we follow the judgment of the imagination) but will consider
          simply form.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1.2.2.2 Secondly, he indicates the method which is the proper one when
          he says: “but will consider simply form” (apart from motion and
          matter), the nature of which he consequently explains in beginning his
          treatment of the proposed question.<br /></p

          We proceed as follows to the first article:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          It seems that speculative science is not appropriately divided into
          these three parts, for:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. The parts of speculative science are the habits that perfect the
          contemplative part of the soul. But the Philosopher says in the
          <i>Ethics</i> that the scientific part of the soul, which is its
          contemplative part, is perfected by three habits, namely, wisdom,
          science, and understanding. Therefore these are the three divisions of
          speculative science, not those proposed in the text.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Again, Augustine says that rational philosophy, or logic, is
          included under contemplative or speculative philosophy. Consequently,
          since no mention is made of it, it seems the division is inadequate.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Again, philosophy is commonly divided into seven liberal arts,
          which include neither natural nor divine science, but only rational
          and mathematical science. Hence natural and divine should not be
          called parts of speculative science.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Again, medicine seems to be the most practical science, and yet it
          is said to contain a speculative part and a practical part. By the
          same token, therefore, all the other practical sciences have a
          speculative part. Consequently, even though it is a practical science,
          ethics or moral science should be mentioned in this division because
          of its speculative part.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. Again, the science of medicine is a branch of physics, and
          similarly certain other arts called “mechanical,” like the science of
          agriculture, alchemy, and others of the same sort. Therefore, since
          these sciences are practical, it seems that natural science should not
          be included without qualification under speculative science.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. Again, a whole should not be contra-distinguished from its part.
          But divine science seems to be a whole in relation to physics
          mathematics, since their subjects are parts of its subject of divine
          science or first philosophy is being; and changeable substance, which
          the natural scientist considers, and also quantity, which the
          mathematician considers, are parts of being. This is clear in the
          <i>Metaphysics</i>. Therefore, divine science should not be
          contra-distinguished from natural science and mathematics.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. Again, as it is said in the <i>De Anima</i>, sciences are divided
          in the same manner as things. But philosophy concerns being, for it is
          knowledge of being, as Dionysius says. Now being is primarily divided
          into potency and act, one and many, substance and accident. So it
          seems that the parts of philosophy ought to be distinguished by such
          divisions of being.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          8. Again, there are many other divisions of beings studied by sciences
          more essential than the divisions into mobile and immobile and into
          abstract and non-abstract; for example, the divisions into corporeal
          and incorporeal and into living and non-living, and the like.
          Therefore differences of this sort should be the basis for the
          division of the parts of philosophy rather than those mentioned here.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          9. Again, that science on which others depend must be prior to them.
          Now all the other sciences depend on divine science because it is its
          business to prove their principles. Therefore Boethius should have
          placed divine science before the others.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          10. Again, mathematics should be studied before natural science, for
          the young can easily learn mathematics, but only the more advanced
          natural science, as is said in the <i>Ethics</i>. This is why the
          ancients are said to have observed the following order in learning the
          sciences: first logic, then mathematics, then natural science, after
          that moral science, and finally men studied divine science. Therefore,
          Boethius should have placed mathematics before natural science. And so
          it seems that this division is unsuitable.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">On the contrary</span>, the
          Philosopher proves the appropriateness of this division in the
          <i>Metaphysics</i>, where he says, “There will be three philosophical
          and theoretical sciences, mathematics, physics, and theology.
          Moreover, in the <i>Physics</i> three methods of the sciences are
          proposed which indeed seem to belong to these three. Moreover, Ptolemy
          also uses this division in the beginning of his <i>Almagest</i>.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply:</span> The theoretical or
          speculative intellect is properly distinguished from the operative or
          practical intellect by the fact that the
          <span style="font-weight: bold">speculative</span> intellect has for
          its end the truth that it contemplates, while the
          <span style="font-weight: bold">practical</span> intellect directs the
          truth under consideration to activity as to an end. So the Philosopher
          says in the <i>De Anima</i> that they differ from each other by their
          ends; and in the <i>Metaphysics</i> he states that “the end of
          speculative knowledge is truth, but the end of practical knowledge is
          action.” Now, since matter must be proportionate to the end, the
          subject-matter of the practical sciences must be things that can be
          made or done by us, so that we can direct the knowledge of them to
          activity as to an end.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          On the other hand, the subject-matter of the
          <span style="font-weight: bold">speculative</span> sciences must be
          things that cannot be made or done by us, so that our knowledge of
          them cannot be directed to activity as to an end. And the speculative
          sciences must differ according to the distinctions among these things.
          Now we must realize that when habits or powers are differentiated by
          their objects they do not differ according to just any distinction
          among these objects, but according to the distinctions that are
          essential to the objects as objects. For example, it is incidental to
          a sense object as such whether it be an animal or a plant.
          Accordingly, the distinction between the senses is not based upon this
          difference but rather upon the difference between color and sound. So
          the speculative sciences must be divided according to differences
          between objects of speculation, considered precisely as such. Now an
          object of this kind ─ namely, an object of a speculative power ─
          derives one characteristic from the side of the power of intellect and
          another from the side of the habit of science that perfects the
          intellect. From the side of the
          <span style="font-weight: bold">intellect</span> it has the fact that
          it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">immaterial</span>,
          because the intellect itself is immaterial. From the side of habit of
          <span style="font-weight: bold">science</span> it has the fact that it
          is <span style="text-decoration: underline">necessary</span>, for
          science treats of necessary matters, as is shown in the
          <i>Posterior Analytics</i>. Now everything that is necessary is, as
          such, immobile, because everything changeable is, as such, able to be
          or not to be, either absolutely or in a certain respect, as is said in
          the <i>Metaphysics</i>. Consequently,
          <span style="text-decoration: underline"
            >separation from matter and motion</span
          >, or connection with them, essentially belongs to an object of
          speculation, which is the object of speculative science. As a result,
          the speculative sciences are differentiated according to their degree
          of separation from matter and motion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          (1) Now there are some objects of speculation that
          <span style="font-weight: bold">depend on matter for their being</span
          >, for they can exist only in matter. And these are subdivided. (a)
          Some depend on matter both for their being
          <span style="font-weight: bold"
            >(+) and for their being understood</span
          >, as do those things whose definition contains sensible matter and
          which, as a consequence, cannot be understood without sensible matter.
          For example, it is necessary to include flesh and bones in the
          definition of man. It is things of this sort that physics or
          <i>natural science</i> studies. (b) On the other hand, there are some
          things that, although dependent upon matter for their being, do not
          depend upon it
          <span style="font-weight: bold">(~) for their being understood</span>,
          because sensible matter is not included in their definitions. This is
          the case with lines and numbers ─ the kind of objects with which
          <i>mathematics</i> deals. (2) There are still other objects of
          speculative knowledge that do not depend upon matter(~) for their
          being, because they can exist without matter; (a) either they never
          exist in matter, as in the case of God and the angels, or (b) they
          exist in matter in some instances and not in others, as in the case of
          substance, quality, being, potency, act, one and many, and the like.
          The science that treats of all these is
          <i>theology or divine science</i>, which is so called because its
          principal object is God. By another name it is called
          <i>metaphysics</i>; that is to say, “beyond physics”, because it ought
          to be learned by us after physics; for we have to proceed from
          sensible things to those that are non-sensible. It is also called
          <i>first philosophy</i>, inasmuch as all the other sciences, receiving
          their principles from it, come after it. Now there can be nothing that
          depends upon matter for its being understood but not for its being,
          because by it; very nature the intellect is immaterial. So there is no
          fourth kind of philosophy besides the ones mentioned.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 1</span>. ln the
          <i>Ethics</i> the Philosopher considers the intellectual habits
          insofar as they are intellectual virtues. Now they are called virtues
          because they perfect the intellect in its operation; for “virtue makes
          its possessor good and renders his work good.” So he distinguishes
          between virtues of this sort in as much as speculative habits perfect
          the intellect in different ways. In one way the speculative part of
          the soul is perfected by understanding, which is the habit of
          principles, through which some things become known of themselves. In
          another way it is perfected by a habit through which conclusions
          demonstrated from these principles are known, whether the
          demonstration proceeds from inferior causes, as in science, or from
          the highest causes, as in wisdom. But when sciences are differentiated
          insofar as they are habits, they must be distinguished according to
          their objects, that is, according to the things of which the sciences
          treat. And it is in this way that both here and in the
          <i>Metaphysics</i> speculative philosophy is distinguished into three
          parts.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 2.</span> As is evident in
          the beginning of the <i>Metaphysics</i>, the speculative sciences
          concern things the knowledge of which is sought for their own sake.
          However, we do not seek to know the things studied by logic for
          themselves, but as a help to the other sciences. So logic is not
          included under speculative philosophy as a principal part but as
          something brought under speculative philosophy as furnishing
          speculative thought with its instruments, namely, syllogisms,
          definitions, and the like, which we need in the speculative sciences.
          Thus, according to Boethius, logic is not so much a science as the
          instrument of science.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 3.</span> The seven liberal
          arts do not adequately divide theoretical philosophy; but, as Hugh of
          St. Victor says, seven arts are grouped together (leaving out certain
          other ones), because those who wanted to learn philosophy were first
          instructed in them. And the reason why they are divided into the
          trivium and quadrivium is that “they are as it were paths
          (<i>viae</i>) introducing the quick mind to the secrets of
          philosophy.” This is also in harmony with the Philosopher’s statement
          in the <i>Metaphysics</i> that we must investigate the method of
          scientific thinking before the sciences themselves. And the
          Commentator says in the same place that before all the other sciences
          a person should learn logic, which teaches the method of all the
          sciences; and the trivium concerns logic. The Philosopher also says in
          the <i>Ethics</i> that the young can know mathematics but not physics,
          because it requires experience. So we are given to understand that
          after logic we should learn mathematics, which the quadrivium
          concerns. These, then, are like paths leading the mind to the other
          philosophical disciplines. We may add that among the other sciences
          these are called arts because they involve not only knowledge but also
          a work that is directly a product of reason itself; for example,
          producing a composition, syllogism or discourse, numbering, measuring,
          composing melodies, and reckoning the course of the stars. Other
          sciences (such as divine and natural science) either do not involve a
          work produced but only knowledge, and so we cannot call them arts,
          because, as the <i>Metaphysics</i> says, art is “productive reason”;
          or they involve some bodily activity, as in the case of medicine,
          alchemy, and other sciences of this kind. These latter, then, cannot
          be called liberal arts because such activity belongs to man on the
          side of his nature in which he is not free, namely, on the side of his
          body. And although moral science is directed to action, still that
          action is not the act of the science but rather of virtue, as is clear
          in the Ethics. So we cannot call moral science an art; but rather in
          these actions virtue takes the place of art. Thus, as Augustine says,
          the ancients defined virtue as the art of noble and well-ordered
          living.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 4.</span> As Avicenna says,
          the distinction between theoretical and practical is not the same when
          philosophy is divided into theoretical and practical, when the arts
          are divided into theoretical and practical, and when medicine is so
          divided. For when we distinguish philosophy or the arts into
          theoretical and practical we must do so on the basis of their end,
          calling that theoretical which is directed solely to knowledge of the
          truth, and that practical which is directed to operation. However,
          there is this difference when we distinguish the whole of philosophy
          and the arts on this basis. We divide philosophy with respect to the
          final end or happiness, to which the whole of human life is directed.
          For, as Augustine says, following Varro, “There is no other reason for
          a man philosophizing except to be happy.” And since the philosophers
          teach that there is a twofold happiness, one contemplative and the
          other active, as is clear in the <i>Ethics</i>, they have accordingly
          a]so distinguished between two parts of philosophy, calling moral
          philosophy practical and natural and rational philosophy theoretical.
          But when they call some arts speculative and some practical, this is
          on the basis of some <i>special</i> ends of those arts; as when we say
          that agriculture is a Practical art but dialectic is theoretical.
          However, when we divide medicine into theoretical and practical, the
          division is not on the basis of the end. For on that basis the whole
          of medicine is practical, since it is directed to practice. But the
          above division is made on the basis of whether what is studied in
          medicine is proximate to, or remote from practice. Thus we call that
          part of medicine practical which teaches the method of healing; for
          instance, that these particular medicines should be given for these
          abscesses. On the other hand, we call that part theoretical which
          teaches the principles directing a man in his practice, although not
          immediately; for instance, that there are three virtues, and that
          there are so many kinds of fever. Consequently, if we call some part
          of a practical science theoretical, we should not on that account
          place that part under speculative philosophy.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 5.</span> One science is
          contained under another in two ways: in one way, as its part, because
          its subject is part of the subject of that other science, as plant is
          part of natural body. So the science of plants is also contained under
          natural science as one of its parts. In another way, one science is
          contained under another as subalternated to it. This occurs when in a
          higher science there is given the reason for what a lower science
          knows only as a fact. This is how music is contained under arithmetic.
          Medicine, therefore, is not contained under physics as a part, for the
          subject of medicine is not part of the subject of natural science from
          the point of view from which it is the subject of medicine. For
          although the curable body is a natural body, it is not the subject of
          medicine insofar as it is curable by nature, but insofar as it is
          curable by art. But because art is nature’s handmaid in healing (in
          which art too plays a part, for health is brought about through the
          power of nature with the assistance of art), it follows that the
          reason for the practices used in the art must be based on the
          properties of natural things. So medicine is subalternated to physics,
          and for the same reason so too are alchemy, the science of
          agriculture, and all sciences of this sort. We conclude, then, that
          physics in itself and in all its parts is speculative, although some
          practical sciences are subalternated to it.

          subjects of the other sciences are parts of being, which is the
          subject of metaphysics, the other sciences are not necessarily parts
          of metaphysics. For each science treats of one part of being in a
          special way distinct from that in which metaphysics treats of being.
          So its subject is not properly speaking a part of the subject of
          metaphysics, for it is not a part of being from the point of view from
          which being is the subject of metaphysics; from this viewpoint it is a
          special science distinct from the others. However, the science
          treating of potency, or that treating of act or unity or anything of
          this sort, could be called a part of metaphysics because these are
          considered in the same manner as being, which is the subject of

          science dealing with them is not distinct from the science of

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 9.</span> Although divine
          science is by nature the first of all the sciences, with respect to us
          the other sciences come before it. For as Avicenna says, the position
          Or this science is that it be learned after the natural sciences,
          which explain many things used by metaphysics, such as generation,
          corruption, motion, and the like. It should also be learned after
          mathematics, because to know the separate substances metaphysics has
          to know the number and disposition of the heavenly spheres, and this
          is impossible without astronomy, which presupposes the whole of
          mathematics. Other sciences, such as music, ethics, and the like,
          contribute to its fullness of perfection. Nor is there necessarily a
          vicious circle because metaphysics presupposes conclusions proved in
          the other sciences while it itself proves their principles. For the
          principles that another science (such as natural philosophy) takes
          from first philosophy do not prove the points which the first
          philosopher takes from the natural philosopher, but they are proved
          through other self-evident principles. Similarly the first philosopher
          does not prove the principles he gives the natural philosopher by
          principles he receives from him, but by other self-evident principles.
          So there is no vicious circle in their definitions. Moreover, the
          sensible effects on which the demonstrations of natural science are
          based are more evident to us in the beginning. But when we come to
          know the first causes through them, these causes will reveal to us the
          reason for the effects, from which they were proved by a demonstration
          <i>quia</i>. In this way natural science also contributes something to
          divine science, and nevertheless it is divine science that explains
          its principles. That is why Boethius places divine science last,
          because it is the last relative to us.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          We proceed as follows to the second article:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          It seems that natural science does not treat of things that exist in
          motion and matter, for
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. Matter is the principle of individuation, Now, according to Plato’s
          doctrine, which is followed by Porphyry, no science treats of
          individual things but only of universals. Therefore, natural science
          does not treat of what is in matter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Again, science pertains to the intellect. But the intellect knows
          by abstracting from matter and from the conditions of matter.
          Therefore, no science can treat of what is not abstracted from matter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Again, as is clear in the <i>Physics</i>, the First Mover is
          considered in natural science. But The First Mover is free from all
          matter. Therefore, natural science does not treat only of what is in
          matter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Again, every science has to do with what is necessary. But whatever
          is moved, as such is contingent, as is proved in the
          <i>Metaphysics</i>. Therefore, no science can treat of what is subject
          to motion; and so neither can natural science.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. Again, no universal is subject to motion; for as is said in the
          beginning of the <i>Metaphysics</i>, it is not man in general who is
          healed, but <i>this</i> man. But every science concerns that which is
          universal. Therefore natural science does not treat of what is in
          motion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. Again, some of the things with which natural science deals are not
          subject to motion; for instance, the soul, as is shown in
          <i>De Anima</i>, and the earth, as is proved in the
          <i>De Caelo et Mundo</i>. What is more, all natural forms neither come
          into being nor perish, and for the same reason they are not subject to
          motion, except accidentally. This is shown in the <i>Metaphysics</i>.
          Therefore not everything that physics considers is in motion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. Again, every creature is mutable for, as Augustine says, true
          immutability belongs to God alone. So if it is the task of natural
          science to consider what is in motion, it will be its business to
          consider all creatures, which clearly appears to be false.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">On the contrary,</span> it is the work
          of natural science to reach conclusions about natural things. Now,
          natural things are those in which there is a principle of motion; and,
          as the <i>Metaphysics</i> says, wherever there is motion there must be
          matter. So natural science treats of what is in motion and matter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, these must be some speculative science dealing with what is
          in matter and motion, for otherwise the teaching of philosophy, which
          is knowledge of being, would be incomplete. Now no other speculative
          science treats of these things, for neither mathematics nor
          metaphysics does so. Therefore, natural science treats of them.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, the fact is clear from the statements of the Philosopher in
          the <i>Metaphysics</i> and the <i>Physics</i>.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply:</span> It was the difficulty of
          this problem that drove Plato to posit Ideas. Believing that all
          sensible things were always in flux, as Cratylus and Heraclitus
          taught, he thought there can be no science concerning them, as the
          Philosopher says in the <i>Metaphysics</i>. So he claimed that there
          were substances separated from the sense world, which might serve as
          the objects of science and of definitions. He made this mistake
          because he failed to distinguish what is essential from what is
          accidental. For it happens that by accident even the wise often fall
          into error, as is said in the <i>Sophistic Refutations</i>. Now, as is
          shown in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, we find in a sensible substance both
          the whole or the composite itself, and also its nature (<i>ratio</i>)
          or form; and it is the composite that is essentially generated and
          corrupted and not the nature or form, except accidentally. As the
          <i>Metaphysics</i> says, “It is not house that is made, but
          <i>this house</i>.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now anything can be thought of without all the items that are not
          essentially related to it. Consequently, forms and natures, though
          belonging to things existing in motion, are without motion when they
          are considered in themselves; and so they can be the objects of
          sciences and of definitions, as the Philosopher says. As he proves,
          the sciences of sensible reality are not based upon the knowledge of
          certain substances separated from the sense world.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Natures of this kind, which are the objects of the sciences of real
          beings, are thought of without motion; and so they must be thought of
          without those conditions by reason of which motion belongs to mobile
          things. Now, because every motion is measured by time, and the primary
          motion is local motion (for without it there is no other motion), a
          thing must be subject to motion inasmuch as it exists here and now;
          and it exists under these conditions insofar as it is individuated by
          matter having determinate dimensions. Consequently, natures of this
          kind, which make possible sciences of things subject to motion, must
          be thought of without determinate matter and everything following upon
          such matter; but not without indeterminate matter, because on its
          notion depends the notion of form that determines matter to itself.
          Thus the nature of man, which his definition signifies and which is
          the object of science, is considered without <i>this</i> flesh and
          <i>these</i> bones, but not absolutely without flesh and bones. And
          because individuals include determinate matter in their nature,
          whereas universals include common matter, as is said in the
          <i>Metaphysics</i>, the above-mentioned abstraction is not said to be
          the abstraction of form from matter absolutely, but the abstraction of
          the universal from the particular.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Natures of this sort, thus abstracted, can be considered in two ways.
          First, in themselves; and then they are thought of without motion and
          determinate matter. This happens to them only by reason of the being
          they have in the intellect. Second, they can be viewed in relation to
          the things of which they are the natures; and these things exist with
          matter and motion. Thus they are principles by which we know these
          things, for everything is known through its form. Consequently, in
          natural science we know mutable and material things existing outside
          the soul through natures of this kind; that is to say, natures that
          are immobile and considered without particular matter.

          principle of individuation only insofar as it exists with determinate

          form is a thing’s quiddity, for, as the <i>De Anima</i> says, the
          object of the intellect is the quiddity of a thing. Now, as is said in
          the <i>Metaphysics</i>, the quiddity of a universal composite, like
          <i>man</i> or <i>animal</i>, includes within itself common but not
          particular matter. So the intellect regularly abstracts from
          determinate matter and its conditions; but in natural science it does
          not abstract from common matter, although matter itself is considered
          in natural science only in relation to form. For this reason the
          natural scientist is more concerned with form than with matter.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 3.</span> Natural science
          does not treat of the First Mover as its subject or as part of its
          subject, but as the end to which natural science leads. Now the end
          does not belong to the nature of the thing of which it is the end, but
          it has a relation to it; as the end of a line is not the line but is
          related to it. So also the First Mover is of a different nature from
          natural things, but it is related to them because it moves them. So it
          falls under the consideration of natural science, not in itself, but
          insofar as it is a mover.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 4.</span> Science treats of
          something in two ways: in one way, primarily and principally; and in
          this sense science is concerned universal natures, which are its very
          foundation. In another way it treats of something secondarily, as by a
          sort of reflection; and in this sense it is concerned with the things
          whose natures they are, inasmuch as, using the lower powers, it
          relates those natures to the particular things possessing them. For a
          knower uses a universal nature both as a thing known and as a means of
          knowing. Thus, through the universal nature of man we can judge of
          this or that particular man. Now, all universal natures of things are
          immutable; and so, in this respect, all science is concerned with what
          is necessary. But some of the things possessing these natures are
          necessary and immutable, whereas others are contingent and subject to
          movement, and in this respect sciences are said to be concerned with
          the contingent and mutable.

          things; and for this reason they come within the domain of natural
          science. But even though the earth as a whole is not moved (for it
          happens to be in its natural place, where a thing is at rest in virtue
          of the same nature through which it is moved to a place),
          nevertheless, when its parts are outside their proper place, they are
          moved to a place. Thus the earth falls within the domain of natural

          It seems that mathematical thinking does not treat, without motion and
          matter, of what exists in matter, for:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. Since truth consists in the conformity of thing to intellect, there
          must be falsehood whenever we think of something otherwise than it is.
          If then in mathematics we consider what is in matter in abstraction
          from matter, we will consider it falsely; and so mathematics will not
          be a science, for every science is concerned with what is true.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Again, as the Philosopher states, every science has the task of
          considering a subject and the parts of the subject. Now in actual
          existence matter is a part of all material things. So it is impossible
          for a science to treat of what is in matter without treating of
          matter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Again, all straight lines are specifically the same. But the
          mathematician treats of straight lines by numbering them; otherwise he
          would not treat of the triangle and the square. It follows that he
          considers lines as specifically the same and numerically different.
          But it is clear from the above that matter is the principle
          differentiating things specifically the same. So the mathematician
          treats of matter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Again, no science completely abstracting from matter demonstrates
          through a material cause. But in mathematics some demonstrations are
          made which can only be reduced to a material cause, as when we
          demonstrate something about a whole by its parts. For, as the
          <i>Physics</i> says, parts are the matter of the whole. Thus in the
          <i>Posterior Analytics</i> the demonstration that the angle in a
          semi-circle is a right angle from the fact that each of its two parts
          is half of a right angle, is reduced to a material cause. Therefore,
          mathematics does not entirely abstract from matter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. Again, motion cannot exist without matter. But the mathematician
          ought to consider motion, because, since motion is measured relative
          to space, to consider the quantity of space, which pertains to the
          mathematician, and the quantity of motion, has the same nature and
          belongs to the same science. Therefore, the mathematician does not
          entirely leave matter out of consideration.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. Again, astronomy is a part of mathematics, and so too is the
          science of the moved sphere, the science of weights, and music, all of
          which treat of motion and mobile things So mathematics does not
          entirely abstract from matter and motion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. Again, natural science is entirely concerned with matter and
          motion. But some conclusions are demonstrated alike by the
          mathematician and the natural scientist, for instance, whether the
          earth is round and whether it is in the middle of the universe.
          Therefore, mathematics cannot entirely abstract from matter. If it be
          said that mathematics abstracts only from sensible matter, the
          contrary seems true. Sensible matter seems to be particular matter,
          because what the senses perceive are particular things, and all the
          sciences abstract from this kind of matter. So mathematical thinking
          should not be called more abstract than that of the other sciences.

          8. Again, the Philosopher says that there are three branches of study:
          the first concerns what is mutable and corruptible, the second what is
          mutable and incorruptible, and the third what is immutable and
          incorruptible. As Ptolemy explains, the first is natural science the
          third divine science, and the second mathematics. Therefore
          mathematics concerns what is mutable.

          Moreover, some things, although existing in matter, do not contain
          matter in their definition; for instance, <i>curve</i>, which differs
          in this respect from <i>snub</i>. Now philosophy should treat of all
          beings. Hence some part of philosophy must consider beings of this
          sort; and this is mathematics, for this does not belong to any other
          part.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, what is prior from the point of view of the intellect can be
          considered without what is posterior. Now mathematicals are prior to
          natural things existing in matter and motion, for the latter are so
          related to mathematicals that they add something to them, as is said
          in the <i>De Caelo et Mundo</i>. Therefore, mathematical investigation
          can be without matter and motion.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply:</span> In order to throw light
          on this question we must understand how the intellect in its operation
          is able to abstract.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          We must realize that, as the Philosopher says, the intellect has two
          operations, one called the “understanding of indivisibles,” by which
          it knows <i>what</i> a thing is, and another by which it joins and
          divides, that is to say, by forming affirmative and negative
          statements. Now these two operations correspond to two principles in
          things. The first operation concerns the nature itself of a thing, in
          virtue of which the object known holds a certain rank among beings,
          whether it be a complete thing, like some whole, or an incomplete
          thing, like a part or an accident. The second operation has to do with
          a thing’s being (<i>esse</i>), which results from the union of the
          principles of a thing in composite substances, or, as in the case of
          simple substances, accompanies the thing’s simple nature.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now, since the truth of the intellect results from its conformity with
          reality, it is clear that in this second operation the intellect
          cannot truthfully abstract what is united in reality, because the
          abstraction would signify a separation with regard to the very being
          of the thing. For example, if I abstract man from whiteness by saying,
          “Man is not white,” I signify that there is a separation in reality.
          So if in reality man and whiteness are not separate, the intellect
          will be false. Through this operation, then, the intellect can
          truthfully abstract only those things that are separate in reality, as
          when we say, “Man is not an ass.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Through the first operation, however, we can abstract things that are
          not separate in reality; not all, it is true, but some. For, since
          everything is intelligible insofar as it is in act, as the
          <i>Metaphysics</i> says, we must understand the nature itself or the
          quiddity of a thing either inasmuch as it is a certain act (as happens
          in the case of forms themselves and simple substances); or through
          that which is its act (as we know composite substances through their
          forms); or through that which takes the place of act in it (as we know
          prime matter through its relation to form, and a vacuum through the
          absence of a body in place). And it is from this that each nature is
          given its definition.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Therefore, when the nature itself is related to, and depends on
          something else, with regard to that which forms the definition
          (<i>ratio</i>) of the nature, and through which the nature itself is
          understood, clearly we cannot know the nature without that other
          thing. This is true whether they are connected as a part is united to
          a whole (as we cannot know <i>foot</i> without knowing <i>animal</i>,
          because that whereby <i>foot</i> has the nature of <i>foot</i> depends
          on that whereby <i>animal</i> is <i>animal</i>); or whether they are
          connected as form is united to matter, or as one part to another part,
          or as accident to subject (as we cannot know <i>snub</i> without
          <i>nose</i>); or even whether they are separated in reality (as we
          cannot know <i>father</i> without knowing <i>son</i>, although these
          relationships are found in different things). But if one thing does
          not depend on another with regard to that which forms the definition
          of the nature, then the intellect can abstract the one from the other
          so as to know it without the other. This is true not only if they are
          separated in reality, like <i>man</i> and <i>stone</i>, but also if
          they are united in reality, whether they are joined as part and whole
          (as <i>letter</i> can be understood without <i>syllable</i>, but not
          vice versa, and <i>animal</i> without <i>foot</i>, but not
          conversely); or even if they are joined as form is united to matter
          and accident to subject (as <i>whiteness</i> can be understood without
          <i>man</i> and vice versa).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Accordingly, through its various operations the intellect
          distinguishes one thing from another in different ways. Through the
          operation by which it composes and divides, it distinguishes one thing
          from another by understanding that the one does not exist in the
          other. Through the operation, however, by which it understands what a
          thing is, it distinguishes one thing from another by knowing what one
          is without knowing anything of the other, either that it is united to
          it or separated from it. So this distinction is not properly called
          separation, but only the first. lt is correctly called abstraction,
          but only when the objects, one of which is known without the other,
          are one in reality. For if we consider animal without considering
          stone, we do not say that we abstract animal from stone.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          It follows that since, properly speaking, we can only abstract objects
          united in existence, there are two sorts of abstraction corresponding
          to the two modes of union mentioned above, namely, the union of part
          and whole, and the union of form and matter. The first is that in
          which we abstract form from matter, and the second is that in which we
          abstract a whole from its parts.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now a form can be abstracted from matter if the essential nature of
          the form does not depend on that particular kind of matter; but the
          intellect cannot abstract form from the kind of matter upon which the
          form depends according to its essential nature. Consequently, because
          all accidents are related to the underlying substance as form to
          matter, and because it is the nature of every accident to depend upon
          substance, no form of this kind can be separated from substance. But
          accidents befall substance in a definite order. Quantity comes to it
          first, then quality, after that passivities (<i>passiones</i>) and
          actions. So quantity can be thought of in substance before the
          sensible qualities (because of which matter is called sensible) are
          considered in it. Quantity, then, according to its essential nature
          does not depend upon sensible matter but only upon intelligible
          matter. For, after accidents have been abstracted, substance is
          intelligible only to the intellect, because it is beyond the sense
          powers to comprehend substance. And abstract objects of this kind are
          the concern of mathematics; it treats of quantities and the properties
          of quantity, such as figures and the like.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, we cannot abstract a whole from just any parts. For there
          are some parts upon which the nature of the whole depends, namely,
          when the being of a particular whole consists in the composition of
          particular parts. It is in this way that a syllable is related to
          letters and a mixed body to the elements. Parts of this sort, which
          are necessary for understanding the whole because they enter into its
          definition, are called parts of the species and of the form. There are
          some parts, however, that are accidental to the whole as such. The
          semicircle, for instance, is related to the circle in this way, for it
          is accidental to a circle that it be divided into two or more equal or
          unequal parts. But it is not accidental to a triangle that three lines
          are designated in it, for because of this a triangle is a triangle.
          Similarly, it is an essential characteristic of man that there be
          found in him a rational soul and a body composed of the four elements.
          So man cannot be understood without these parts and they must be
          included in his definition; so they are parts of his species and form.
          But finger, foot, and hand, and other parts of this kind are outside
          the definition of man; and thus the essential nature of man does not
          depend on them and he can be understood without them. For whether or
          not he has feet, as long as he is constituted of a rational soul and a
          body composed of the elements in the proper mixture required by this
          sort of form, he will be a man. These parts are called parts of
          matter: they are not included in the definition of the whole, but
          rather the converse is true. This is how all determinate
          (<i>signatae</i>) parts are related to man; for instance,
          <i>this</i> soul, <i>this</i> body, <i>this</i> nail,
          <i>this</i> bone, etc. These indeed are parts of the essence of
          Socrates and Plato, but not of man precisely as man; and therefore the
          intellect can abstract man from these parts. And this is the
          abstraction of the universal from the particular.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          So there are two abstractions of the intellect. One corresponds to the
          union of form and matter or accident and subject. This is the
          abstraction of form from sensible matter. The other corresponds to the
          union of whole and part; and to this corresponds the abstraction of
          the universal from the particular. This is the abstraction of a whole,
          in which we consider a nature absolutely, according to its essential
          character, in independence of all parts that do not belong to the
          species but are accidental parts. But we do not find abstractions
          opposed to these, by which a part is abstracted from a whole by the
          intellect if it is one of the parts of matter in whose definition the
          whole is included, or it can even exist without the whole if it is one
          of the parts of the species, for instance, a line without a triangle,
          a letter without a syllable, or an element without a mixed body. But
          in the case of things that can exist separately, separation rather
          than abstraction obtains. Similarly, when we say from is abstracted
          from matter, we do not mean substantial form, because substantial form
          and the matter correlative to it are interdependent, so that one is
          not intelligible without the other, because the appropriate act is in
          its appropriate matter. Rather, we mean the accidental forms of
          quantity and figure, from which indeed sensible matter cannot be
          abstracted by the intellect, because sensible qualities cannot be
          understood unless quantity is presupposed, as is clear in the case of
          surface and color. And neither can we understand something to be the
          subject of motion unless we understand it to possess quantity.
          Substance, however, which is the intelligible matter of quantity, can
          exist without quantity. Consequently, the consideration of substance
          without quantity belongs to the order of separation rather than to
          that of abstraction.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          We conclude that there are three kinds of distinction in the operation
          of the intellect. There is one through the operation of the intellect
          joining and dividing which is properly called separation and this
          belongs to divine science or metaphysics. There is another through the
          operation by which the quiddities of things are conceived which is the
          abstraction of form from sensible matter, and this belongs to
          mathematics. And there is a third through the same operation which is
          the abstraction of a universal from a particular, and this belongs to
          physics and to all the sciences in general, because science disregards
          accidental features and treats of necessary matters. And because
          certain men (for example, the Pythagoreans and the Platonists) did not
          understand the difference between the last two kinds of distinction
          and the first, they fell into error, asserting that the objects of
          mathematics and universals exist separate from sensible things.

          it is. Thus, he does not think that a line exists without sensible
          matter, but he treats of a line and its properties without considering
          sensible matter. So there is no disagreement between his intellect and
          reality, because even in reality what belongs to the nature of a line
          does not depend upon that which makes matter sensible, but vice versa.
          Consequently, it is evident that “there is no error in the one who
          abstracts,” as is said in the <i>Physics</i>.

          meant not only that which has matter as a part, but also that which
          exists in matter; and in this way sensible line can be called
          something material. So this does not prevent a line from being
          understood without matter. For sensible matter is not related to a
          line as a part, but rather as the subject in which it exists, and this
          is also the case with a surface or body. Obviously, the mathematician
          does not treat of the kind of body that is in the category of
          substance, whose parts are matter and form, but rather the body in the
          category of quantity, constituted by three dimensions. Body, in this
          sense of the term, is related to body the category of substance (of
          which physical matter is a part) as accident to its subject.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 3.</span> Matter is the
          principle of numerical diversity or inasmuch as, being divided into
          many parts, and receiving in each part a form of the same nature, it
          constitutes many individuals of the same species. Now matter can be
          divided only if we presuppose quantity in it; if that is taken away,
          even substance remains indivisible. So the primary reason for the
          diversification of things of one species lies in quantity. And this is
          due to quantity because position, which is the arrangement of parts in
          place, is contained in its notion as a kind of formal difference. So
          even when the intellect has abstracted quantity from sensible matter,
          it is still possible to imagine numerically different things in the
          same species, for example, several equilateral triangles and several
          equal straight lines.

          motion is not in the category of quantity, but it partakes somewhat of
          the nature of quantity from another source, namely, according as the
          division of motion derives from either the division of space or the
          division of the thing subject to motion. So it does not belong to the
          mathematician to treat of motion, although mathematical principles can
          be applied to motion. Therefore, inasmuch as the principles of
          quantity are applied to motion, the natural scientist treats of the
          division and continuity of motion, as is clear in the <i>Physics</i>.
          And the measurements of motions are studied in the intermediate
          sciences between mathematics and natural science: for instance, in the
          science of the moved sphere and in astronomy.

          their properties remain in composite bodies although in a different
          way, as the proper qualities of the elements and their proper
          movements are found in a mixed body. What is proper to composite
          bodies, however, is not found in simple bodies. And so it is that the
          more abstract and simple the objects of a science are, the more
          applicable its principles are to the other sciences. Thus the
          principles of mathematics are applicable to natural things, but not
          visa versa, because physics presupposes mathematics; but the converse
          is not true, as is clear in the <i>De Caelo et Mundo</i>. So there are
          three levels of sciences concerning natural and mathematical entities.
          Some are purely natural and treat of the properties of natural things
          as such, like physics, agriculture, and the like. Others are purely
          mathematical and treat of quantities absolutely, as geometry considers
          magnitude and arithmetic numbers. Still others are intermediate, and
          these apply mathematical principles to natural things; for instance,
          music, astronomy, and the like. These sciences, however, have a closer
          affinity to mathematics, because in their thinking that which is
          physical is, as it were, material, whereas that which is mathematical
          is, as it were, formal. For example, music considers sounds, not
          inasmuch as they are sounds, but inasmuch as they are proportionable
          according to numbers; and the same holds in other sciences. Thus they
          demonstrate their conclusions concerning natural things, but by means
          of mathematics. Therefore nothing prevents their being concerned with
          sensible matter insofar as they have something in common with natural
          science, but insofar as they have something in common with mathematics
          they are abstract.

          incorruptible, while the mathematician as such does not treat of

          separately and in order, although these three sorts of things can be
          apportioned to the three sciences. For incorruptible and immobile

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          It seems that divine science does not treat of things separate from
          motion and matter, for:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. Divine science seems to he especially concerned with God. Now we
          can come to know God only by way of his visible effects, which are
          created in matter and motion, as it is said in the Epistle to the
          Romans, “The invisible things of him, from the creation of the world,
          are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.”
          Therefore, divine science does not abstract from matter and motion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Again, that to which motion in some way belongs is not entirely
          separate from motion and matter. But motion in some way belongs to
          God. Thus it is said in <i>Wisdom</i> that the Spirit of Wisdom is
          “mobile” and “more mobile than all mobile things.” And Augustine says
          that God moves himself without time and place. Plato also asserted
          that the First Mover moves itself. Therefore divine science, which
          treats of God, is not entirely separate from motion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Again, divine science must treat not only of God but also of
          angels. But angels change both with regard to choice, because they
          became bad after having been good, and also with regard to place, as
          is evident in the case of those who are sent as messengers. So the
          objects of divine science are not entirely separated from motion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Again, as the Commentator seems to say in the beginning of the
          <i>Physics</i>, every being is either pure matter, or pure form, or a
          composite of matter and form. But an angel is not a pure form, because
          then he would be pure act, which is true of God alone. Neither is he
          pure matter. So he is a composite of matter and form. Therefore divine
          science does not abstract from matter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. Again, divine science, the third part of speculative philosophy, is
          the same as metaphysics, whose subject is being, and especially
          substantial being. This is clear in the <i>Metaphysics</i>. But being
          and substance do not abstract from matter; otherwise there would be no
          material being. So divine science does not abstract from matter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. Again, according to the Philosopher, it is the business of a
          science to consider not only a subject but also the divisions and
          attributes of that subject. Now, as we have said, being is the subject
          of divine science. Therefore it is the business of this science to
          treat of all beings. But matter and motion are beings. Therefore they
          come under the consideration of metaphysics, and so divine science
          does not abstract from them.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          7. Again, divine science demonstrates by means of three causes:
          efficient, formal, and final, as the Commentator says, But we cannot
          consider an efficient cause without taking motion into account; and
          the same thing is true of a final cause, as the
          <i>Metaphysics</i> says. Thus, because the objects of mathematics are
          immobile, there are no demonstrations through these causes in that
          science. Consequently, divine science does not abstract from motion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          8. Again, in theology we treat of the creation of the heavens and the
          earth, of acts of men, and many similar things that involve matter and
          motion. So theology does not seem to abstract from matter and motion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">On the contrary,</span> the
          Philosopher says in the <i>Metaphysics</i> that “first philosophy
          deals with things that can exist separately,” that is, from matter,
          “and with immobile things.” Now first philosophy is divine science, as
          he says in the same place. Therefore divine science abstracts from
          matter and motion.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, the most excellent science deals with the most excellent
          beings. But the most excellent science is divine science. Therefore,
          since immaterial and immobile beings are the most excellent, divine
          science will treat of them.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, the Philosopher says in the beginning of the
          <i>Metaphysics</i> that divine science concerns first principles and
          causes. Now these are immaterial and immobile. Therefore things of
          this sort are the objects of divine science.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply:</span> In order to throw light
          on this question we must understand what science should be called
          divine science. We must realize indeed that if a science considers a
          subject-genus, it must investigate the principles of that genus, since
          science is perfected only through knowledge of principles, as the
          Philosopher explains in the beginning of the <i>Physics</i>. Now there
          are two kinds of <span style="font-weight: bold">principles</span>.
          (1) Some are complete natures in themselves and nevertheless they are
          the principles of other things, as the heavenly bodies are principles
          of lower bodies and simple bodies are principles of mixed bodies. In
          the sciences, therefore, we study them not only insofar as they are
          principles, but also insofar as they are certain things in themselves.
          And for this reason they are considered not only in the science of the
          beings of which they are the principles, but also in a separate
          science. Thus there is a branch of natural science treating of
          heavenly bodies distinct from that treating of lower bodies, and there
          is one treating of the elements distinct from that treating of mixed
          bodies. (2) There are some principles, however, that are not complete
          natures in themselves, but only principles of natures, as unity is the
          principle of number, point the principle of line, and form and matter
          principles of natural bodies. Principles of this sort, then, are
          investigated only in the science dealing with the things of which they
          are principles.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now just as there are certain common principles of any particular
          genus extending to all the principles of that genus, so too all
          beings, inasmuch as they share in being, have certain principles that
          are the principles of all beings. And as Avicenna says,” these
          principles can be called
          <span style="font-weight: bold">common</span> in two ways, (1) first,
          by <span style="font-weight: bold">predication</span>, as when I say
          that form is common to all forms because it is predicated of all; (2)
          second, by <span style="font-weight: bold">causality</span>, as we say
          that the sun, which is numerically one, is the principle of all things
          subject to generation.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now there are principles common to all beings not only in the first
          way (in this sense the Philosopher says that all beings have
          proportionately the same principles), but also in the second way, so
          that there are certain beings, each numerically one, which are the
          principles of all things. Thus the principles of accidents are
          reducible to the principles of substance, and the principles of
          perishable substances are reducible to imperishable ones, with the
          result that all beings are reducible to certain principles in a
          definite graded order.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          And since the principle of the being of all things must be being in
          the highest degree as the <i>Metaphysics</i> says, these principles
          must be most perfect and therefore
          <span style="font-weight: bold">supremely in act</span>, so that they
          have no potentiality whatsoever, or the least possible, because
          actuality is prior to, and more excellent than potentiality, as the
          <i>Metaphysics</i> says. For this reason they must be free from
          matter, which is in potency, and free from motion, which is actuality
          of that which exists in potency. Divine beings are of this sort,
          “because if the divine exists anywhere, it exists especially in such a
          nature” (that is to say, in a nature that is immaterial and
          immutable), as is sad in the <i>Metaphysics</i>.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Accordingly, because these divine beings are the principles of all
          things and nevertheless they are complete natures in themselves, they
          can be studied in two ways: (1) first, insofar as they are the
          <span style="font-weight: bold">common principles</span> of all
          things, and (2) second insofar as they are
          <span style="font-weight: bold">beings in their own right</span>. But
          even though these first principles are most evident in themselves, our
          intellect regards them as the eye of an owl does the light of the sun,
          as the <i>Metaphysics</i> says. We can reach them by the light of
          natural reason only to the extent that their effects reveal them to
          us. It was in this way that the philosophers came to know them as is
          clear from the Epistle to the Romans: “The invisible things of God...
          are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.”
          Philosophers, then, study these divine beings
          <span style="text-decoration: underline"
            >only insofar as they are the principles of all things</span
          >. Consequently, they are the objects of the science that investigates
          what is common to all beings, which has for its subject being as
          being. The philosophers call this divine science.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          There is, however, another way of knowing beings of this kind, (a) not
          as their effects reveal them, but (b)
          <span style="text-decoration: underline"
            >as they reveal themselves</span
          >. The Apostle mentions this way in his First Epistle to the
          Corinthians: “So the things also that are of God no man knows, but the
          Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but
          the Spirit that is of God, that we may understand.” And again, “But to
          us God has revealed them by his Spirit.” In this way we consider
          divine beings as they subsist in themselves and not only inasmuch as
          they are the principles of things.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Accordingly, there are two kinds of theology or divine science. (1)
          There is one that treats of divine things, not as the subject of the
          science but as the
          <span style="font-weight: bold">principles</span> of the subject. This
          is the kind of theology pursued by the philosophers and that is also
          called <i>metaphysics</i>. (2) There is another theology, however,
          that investigates divine things
          <span style="font-weight: bold">for their own sakes</span> as the
          subject of the science. This is the theology taught in
          <i>Sacred Scripture</i>.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Both treat of beings that exist separate from matter and motion, but
          with a difference, for something can exist separate from matter and
          motion in two distinct ways: (1) first, because by its nature the
          thing that is called separate in no way can exist in matter and
          motion, as God and the angels are said to be separate from matter and
          motion. (2) Second, because by its nature it does not exist in matter
          and motion; but it can exist without them, though we sometimes find it
          with them. In this way being, substance, potency, and act are separate
          from matter and motion, because they do not depend on them for their
          existence, unlike the objects of mathematics, which can only exist in
          matter, though they can be understood without sensible matter.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Thus philosophical theology investigates beings separate in the second
          sense as its subjects, and beings separate in the first sense as the
          principles of its subject. But the theology of Sacred Scripture treats
          of beings separate in the first sense as its subjects, though it
          concerns some items in matter and motion insofar as this is needed to
          throw light on divine things.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 1.</span> When something is
          incorporated into a science only to throw light on something else, it
          does not belong to the science essentially, but, in a way,
          incidentally, as some mathematics are incorporated into the natural
          sciences. In this way nothing prevents some things in matter and
          motion being in divine science.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 2.</span> We do not attribute
          motion to God properly, but by a kind of metaphor, and this in two
          ways, first, according as the operation of the intellect or will is
          improperly called motion; and in this way a person is said to move
          himself when he knows or loves himself. ln this sense, as the
          Commentator says, the statement of Plato is true, that the First Mover
          moves himself because he knows and loves himself. Second, according as
          the flowing forth of effects From their causes can be called a
          procession or motion of cause to effect insofar as the likeness of the
          cause is left in the effect itself; and so the cause, which previously
          existed in itself, afterward comes to be in the effect through its
          likeness. And in this way God, who has communicated his likeness to
          all creatures, in a certain respect is said to be moved by all of them
          or to go forward to all things. Dionysius frequently uses this manner
          of speaking. This also seems to be the meaning of the statement in
          Wisdom, that “Wisdom is more mobile than all mobile things,” and that
          “She reaches from end to end mightily.” However, this is not motion in
          the proper sense the term, and so the argument does not follow.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 3.</span> Divine science
          received through divine inspiration does not treat of the angels as
          its subject, but only as something incorporated into the science to
          throw light on its subject. For Sacred Scripture treats of the angels
          just as it does other creatures. In the divine science taught by the
          philosophers, however, the angels, which they call Intelligences, are
          considered from the same point of view as the First Cause or God,
          insofar as they are also secondary principles of things, at least
          through the movement of the spheres, though the angels themselves are
          subject to no physical motion. Moreover, motion with respect to choice
          is reducible to the sense in which the act of the intellect or will is
          called motion, which is an improper sense of the term, motion being
          understood as operation. Further, when angels are said to move in
          place, their motion is not with reference to enclosure in place but
          with reference to the activity they exercise in this or that place, or
          with reference to some other relation they have to place, although
          that relation is absolutely equivocal to that which a localized body
          has to place. So it is clear that they do not move in the sense in
          which we say natural things move.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 4.</span> Act and potency are
          more common than matter and form. Therefore, even though we do not
          find the composition of form and matter in the angels we can still
          find potency and act in them. For matter and form are parts of a thing
          composed of matter and form; and so we find the composition of matter
          and form only in things with parts, one of which is related to the
          other as potency to act. Now what can be, can also not be; and so one
          part can be found with or without the other; and therefore, as the
          Commentator says, we find the composition of matter and form only in
          those things that are by nature corruptible. Nor is the objection
          valid, that an accident may be eternally conserved in a subject, like
          shape in the heavens. For a heavenly body cannot exist without such a
          shape, since shape and all accidents in general follow upon substance
          as their cause. So a subject is related to its accidents not only as
          passive potency, but also in a way as an active power; and for this
          reason some accidents are naturally conserved forever in their
          subjects. But matter is not the cause of form in this way; and
          therefore all matter subject to form can cease to be subject to it,
          unless perhaps an extrinsic cause preserves it; thus we maintain that
          by the divine power even some bodies composed of contraries, like the
          bodies of those arisen from the dead, are incorruptible.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now, since the essence of an angel is incorruptible by its nature, it
          is not composed of form and matter. But an angel does not exist of
          himself, and so he is potential to the being (<i>esse</i>) he receives
          from God. Consequently, the being (<i>esse</i>) received from God is
          related to his simple essence as act to potency. This is what is meant
          by saying that angels are composed of what they are (<i>quod est</i>)
          and that by which they are (<i>quo est</i>); being (<i>esse</i>) is
          understood as that by which they are and the angelic nature as what
          they are. However, even if angels were composed of matter and form,
          they would not be composed of sensible matter, from which both the
          objects of mathematics must be abstracted and those of metaphysics
          must be separated.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 5.</span> We say that being
          and substance are separate from matter and motion not because it is of
          their nature to be without them, as it is of the nature of ass to be
          without reason, but because it is not of their nature to be in matter
          and motion, although sometimes they are in matter and motion, as
          animal abstracts from reason, although some animals are rational.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 6.</span> The metaphysician
          deals with individual beings too, not with regard to their special
          natures, in virtue of which they are special kinds of being, but
          insofar as they share the common character of being. And in this way
          matter and motion also fall under his consideration.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 7.</span> Action and passion
          do not belong to things as they exist in thought but as they exist in
          reality. Now since the mathematician deals with things that are
          abstract only in thought, insofar as they come under his consideration
          they cannot be the principle or the end of motion. So the
          mathematician does not demonstrate by means of efficient and final
          causes. But the things the metaphysician deals with are separate,
          existing in reality, and these can be the principle and end of motion.
          So nothing prevents his demonstrating by means of efficient and final
          causes.

          object the First Truth itself, and yet the articles of faith contain
          certain other things relating to creatures insofar as they have some
          connection with the First Truth, in the same way theology is primarily
          concerned with God as its subject, but it includes many things about

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          The next question concerns the methods ascribed by Boethius to the
          speculative sciences. There are four points of inquiry in this
          connection:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          1. Must we proceed according to the mode of reason in natural science,
          according to the mode of learning in mathematics, and according to the
          mode of intellect in divine science?

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          2. Should we entirely abandon the imagination in divine science?

          lt seems that we must no proceed according to the mode of reason in
          natural science, for:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. Rational philosophy is contra-distinguished from natural
          philosophy. But it seems to belong properly to rational philosophy to
          proceed according to the mode of reason. So this method is not
          appropriately ascribed to natural philosophy.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Again, in the <i>Physics</i> the Philosopher frequently
          distinguishes between the methods of arriving at rational conclusions
          and physical conclusions. Therefore it is not the special
          characteristic of natural science to proceed rationally.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Again, what is common to all the sciences should not be reserved to
          one. But every science proceeds by reasoning, advancing from effects
          to causes or from causes to effects or from certain signs So this
          method should not be reserved to natural science.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Again, in the <i>Ethics</i> the Philosopher distinguishes the
          reasoning part of the soul from the scientific part. But natural
          philosophy belongs to the scientific part. Therefore it is not
          appropriately said to proceed according to the mode of reason.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">On the contrary,</span> the
          <i>De Spiritu et Anima</i> says that reason is concerned with the
          forms of bodies. Now it belongs most especially to natural philosophy
          to consider bodies. Therefore the rational method is appropriately
          attributed to it.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, Boethius says: “When reason contemplates some universal
          nature, using neither imagination nor sense, it nevertheless
          comprehends imaginable and sensible things.” Now it belongs to the
          natural philosopher alone to comprehend what is imaginable and
          sensible. Therefore the rational method is suitably attributed to
          natural philosophy.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in">(b)</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">In the second place,</span> it seems
          inappropriate to say that mathematics proceeds according to the mode
          of learning, for:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. Learning seems to be nothing else than the receiving knowledge. But
          we receive scientific knowledge in all branches of philosophy, because
          all proceed by means of demonstration. So it is common to all parts of
          philosophy to proceed according to the mode of learning; and so this
          procedure should not be made exclusive to mathematics.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Again, the more certain something is, the easier it seems to learn
          it. But natural things seem to be more certain than mathematics
          because they are apprehended by the senses, from which all our
          knowledge takes its origin. Therefore this method belongs to the
          natural philosopher rather than to the mathematician.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Again, as the <i>Metaphysics</i> says, in the sciences we begin at
          the point from which we learn more easily. But learning begins with
          logic, which must be mastered before mathematics and all the other
          sciences. Therefore it belongs to logic rather than to the other
          sciences to proceed according to the mode of learning.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Again, the methods of natural and divine science are taken from
          powers of the soul, namely from reason and intellect. Therefore in the
          same way the method of mathematics ought to be taken from some power
          of the soul. So it is not appropriate to say that its method is to
          proceed according to the mode of learning.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">On the contrary,</span> to proceed
          according to the mode of learning is to proceed by demonstration and
          with certitude. But as Ptolemy says, “Mathematics alone, if one
          applies himself diligently to it, will give the inquirer after
          knowledge firm and unshaken certitude by demonstrations carried out
          with unquestionable methods.” Therefore it is most characteristic of
          mathematics to proceed according to the mode of learning. Moreover,
          this is evident from the Philosopher who, in several places in his
          works, calls the mathematical sciences disciplines.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in">(c)</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">In the third place,</span> it seems
          that it is not appropriate to divine science to proceed according to
          the mode of intellect, for:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. According to the Philosopher,” there is understanding
          (<i>intellectus</i>) of principles, whereas there is science of
          conclusions. But principles alone are not considered in divine
          science; some conclusions are also considered. Therefore to proceed
          according to the mode of intellect is not appropriate to divine
          science.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Again, we cannot proceed intellectually with regard to those things
          that transcend every intellect. But divine things transcend every
          intellect, as Dionysius and the Philosopher say. Therefore they cannot
          be dealt with intellectually.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Again, Dionysius says that angels have intellectual power inasmuch
          as they do not gather their divine knowledge from what is sensible and
          divided; but, as he adds, this is beyond the power of the soul.
          Therefore, since the divine science that is now under discussion is a
          science belonging to the human soul, it appears that its proper method
          is not to proceed intellectually.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Again, theology seems particularly concerned with the things of
          faith. But understanding (<i>intelligere</i>) is the goal of the
          things of faith. Thus it is said in lsaiah, according to another
          version, “Unless you believe, you will not understand.” So we should
          not say that proceeding intellectually about divine things is the
          method of theology but the goal.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">On the contrary,</span> the
          <i>De Spiritu et Anima</i> says that intellect (<i>intellectus</i>)
          has for its object created spirits, while understanding
          (<i>intelligentia</i>) has for its object God himself. Now divine
          science is principally concerned with them. Therefore it seems proper
          to it to proceed intellectually.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, the method of a science must correspond to its subject
          matter. But divine things are intelligible in virtue of themselves.
          Therefore the method appropriate to divine science is to proceed
          intellectually.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply:</span> To the first question
          (<span style="font-weight: bold">a</span>) I reply that a method of
          proceeding in the sciences is called rational in three ways:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          ln one way, because of the
          <span style="font-weight: bold">principles</span> from which we begin;
          for instance, when we proceed to prove something beginning with mental
          beings, like genus, species, opposite, and concepts of this sort,
          which the logicians study. In this sense a method will be called
          rational when in a science we use the propositions taught in logic;
          namely, when we use logic as having a teaching function in the other
          sciences. But this method of proceeding cannot belong properly to any
          particular science: it will fall into error unless it proceeds from
          its own proper principles. However, logic and metaphysics may properly
          and suitably use this method, because both are universal sciences and
          in a sense treat of the same subject.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In a second way, a method is called rational because of the
          <span style="font-weight: bold">end</span> that terminates the
          thinking process. (1) For the ultimate end that rational inquiry ought
          to reach is the understanding of principles, in which we resolve our
          judgments. And when this takes place, it is not called a rational
          procedure or proof but a
          <span style="font-weight: bold">demonstration</span>. (2) Sometimes,
          however, rational inquiry, cannot arrive at the ultimate end, but
          stops in the course of the investigation itself; that is to say, when
          several possible solutions still remain open to the investigator. This
          happens when we proceed by means of
          <span style="font-weight: bold">probable</span> arguments, which by
          their nature produce opinion or belief, but not science. In this
          sense, <i>rational</i> method is opposed to
          <i>demonstrative</i> method. We can proceed by this rational method in
          all the sciences, preparing the way for necessary, proofs by probable
          arguments. This is another use of logic in the demonstrative sciences;
          not indeed as having a teaching function, but as being an instrument.
          ln these two ways, then, a method is called rational from rational
          science, for, as the Commentator says, in both of them logic (which is
          another name for rational science) is used in the demonstrative
          sciences.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          In a third way, a method is called rational from
          <span style="font-weight: bold">the rational power</span>, that is,
          inasmuch as in our procedure we follow the manner proper to the
          rational soul in knowing, and in this sense the rational method is
          proper to natural science. For in its procedures natural science keeps
          the characteristic method of the rational soul in two ways. (1) First,
          in this respect, that just as the rational soul receives from sensible
          things (which are more knowable relatively to us) knowledge of
          intelligible things (which are more knowable in their nature), so
          natural science
          <span style="text-decoration: underline"
            >proceeds from what is better known to us and less knowable in its
            own nature</span
          >. This is evident in the <i>Physics</i>. Moreover, demonstration by
          means of a
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">sign or an effect</span> is
          used especially in natural science. (2) Secondly, natural science uses
          a rational method in this respect, that it is characteristic of reason
          to
          <span style="font-weight: bold">move from one thing to another</span>;
          and this method is observed particularly in natural science, where we
          go from the knowledge of one thing to the knowledge of another; for
          example, from the knowledge of an effect to the knowledge of its
          cause. (a) And the procedure in natural science is not only a movement
          from one thing to another
          <span style="text-decoration: underline"
            >distinct from it in the mind and not in reality</span
          >, as when we go from the concept <i>animal</i> to the concept
          <i>man</i>. In the mathematical sciences we proceed only by means of
          what is of the essence of a thing, since they demonstrate only through
          a formal cause. In these sciences, therefore, we do not demonstrate
          something about one thing through another thing, but through the
          proper definition of that thing. It is true that some demonstrations
          about the circle are made by means of the triangle or vice versa, but
          this is only because the triangle is potentially in the circle and
          vice versa. (b) But in natural science, where demonstration takes
          place through
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">extrinsic causes</span>,
          something is proved of one thing through another thing entirely
          external to it. So the method of reason is particularly observed in
          natural science; and on this account natural science among all the
          others is most in conformity with the human intellect. Consequently,
          we say that natural science proceeds rationally, not because this is
          true of it alone, but because it is especially characteristic of it.

          that is proper to natural science.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 4.</span> In that place the
          Philosopher considers the reasoning and deliberative parts of the soul
          to be identical: so it is clear that they are related to the second
          mode of rational procedure mentioned above. In the same place,
          moreover, because of their contingency he assigns human actions, which
          are the objects of moral science, to the reasoning or deliberative
          part of the soul. From what has been said, then, we can gather that
          the first mode of rationality is most characteristic of rational
          science, the second of moral science, and the third of natural
          science.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">To the second question (b)</span> I
          reply that <i>mathematical</i> science is said to proceed according to
          the mode of <span style="font-weight: bold">learning</span>, not
          because it alone does so, but because this is especially
          characteristic of it. For, since learning is nothing else than the
          taking of knowledge from another, we are said to proceed according to
          the mode of learning when our procedure leads to certain knowledge,
          which is called science. Now this occurs particularly in the
          mathematical sciences. Because mathematics is situated between natural
          and divine science, it is
          <span style="font-weight: bold">more certain</span> than either.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          It is more certain than <i>natural science</i> because its
          investigation is not bound up with motion and matter, while the
          investigation of natural science centers upon matter and motion. Now
          from the very fact that natural science deals with matter, its
          knowledge depends upon many factors, upon the consideration of matter
          itself, of form, and of the material dispositions and properties
          accompanying form in matter. And whenever there are many factors to be
          considered in order to know something, knowledge is more difficult.
          Thus the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> says that a science is less
          certain that results from adding on some item, as geometry adds
          something to arithmetic. If the inquiry in a science is about things
          that are mobile and lack uniformity, its knowledge is less exact
          because its demonstrations are often valid only in the majority of
          cases, owing to the fact that things sometimes happen differently. So,
          too, the more a science draws close to particulars (as do practical
          sciences like medicine, alchemy, and ethics), the less certain they
          can be because of the many factors to be taken into account in these
          sciences, the omission of any one of which will lead to error, and
          also because of their variability.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The method of mathematics is also more certain than the method of
          <i>divine science</i>, because the objects of divine science are
          further removed from sensible things, from which our knowledge takes
          its origin. This is true both in the case of the separate substances
          (to which our knowledge of the sense world gives us inadequate
          access), and also in the case of the principles common to all things
          (which are most universal and therefore furthest removed from the
          particular things falling under the senses). But mathematical entities
          do fall under the senses and they are objects of our imagination; for
          example, figures, lines, numbers, and the like. So the human
          intellect, which takes its knowledge from images, knows these things
          with greater ease and certainty than it does a separate Intelligence,
          or even the nature of substance, act, potency, and the like.

          sometimes in learning it is necessary to start, not with what is
          easier, but with that on which the knowledge of subsequent matters
          depends. That is why in acquiring knowledge we must begin with logic,
          not because it is easier than other sciences (for it involves the
          greatest difficulty, concerned as it is with second intentions), but
          because the sciences depend on it inasmuch as it teaches the method of
          proceeding in all the sciences. And, as the <i>Metaphysics</i> says,
          we must know the method of science before science itself.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 4.</span> The method of the
          sciences is taken from the powers of the soul because of the way in
          which these powers operate. So the methods of the sciences do not
          correspond to the soul’s powers, but rather to the ways in which these
          powers can operate, and these are diversified not only according to
          the powers, but also according to their objects. So it is not
          necessary that the method of every science be named after a power of
          the soul. However, we can say that just as the method of physics is
          taken from reason inasmuch as it gets its objects from the senses, and
          the method of divine science is taken from the intellect inasmuch as
          it understands something purely and simply (<i>nude</i>), so also the
          method of mathematics can be taken from reason inasmuch as it obtains
          its objects from the imagination.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">To the third question (c)</span> I
          reply that just as we attribute the rational method to natural
          philosophy because it adheres most closely to the method of reason, so
          we attribute the
          <span style="font-weight: bold">intellectual</span> method to
          <i>divine science</i> because it adheres most closely to the method of
          intellect. Now reason differs from intellect as multitude does from
          unity. Thus Boethius says that reasoning is related to understanding
          as time to eternity and as a circle to its center. For it is
          distinctive of reason to disperse itself in the consideration of many
          things, and then to gather one simple truth from them. Thus Dionysius
          says, “Souls have the power of reasoning in that they approach the
          truth of things from various angles, and in this respect they are
          inferior to the angels; but inasmuch as they gather a multiplicity
          into unity they are in a way equal to the angels.” Conversely,
          intellect first contemplates a truth one and undivided and in that
          truth comprehends a whole multitude, as God, by knowing his essence,
          knows all things. Thus Dionysius says: “Angelic minds have the power
          of intellect in that they understand divine truths in a unified way.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          It is clear, then, that rational thinking ends in intellectual
          thinking, Following the process of analysis, in which reason gathers
          one simple truth from many things. And again, intellectual thinking is
          the beginning of rational thinking, following the process of
          synthesis, in which the intellect comprehends a multiplicity in unity.
          So the thinking that is the terminus of all human reasoning is
          supremely intellectual.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now all rational thinking in all the sciences, following the way of
          analysis, terminates in the knowledge of divine science. For, as we
          have said, reason sometimes advances from one thing to another in the
          order of reality; for example, when a demonstration is made through
          external causes or effects, by synthesis when we go from causes to
          effects, by analysis when we proceed from effects to causes, for
          causes are more simple, unchangeable, and uniformly constant than
          their effects. Consequently, the ultimate end of analysis in this
          process is attainment d the highest and most simple causes, which are
          the separate substances. At other times, however, reason advances from
          one item to another distinct in the mental order, as when we proceed
          according to intrinsic causes, by synthesis when we go from the most
          universal forms to the more particular ones, by analysis when we
          proceed conversely, because what is more universal is more simple. Now
          that which is most universal is common to all beings; and so the
          ultimate end of analysis in this process is the consideration of being
          and the properties of being as being. And, as we said above, these are
          the objects of divine science; namely, the separate substances and
          that which is common to all beings. It is evident, therefore, that its
          thinking is supremely intellectual.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          It also follows that divine science gives principles to all the other
          sciences, because intellectual thinking is the starting point of
          rational thinking; and for this reason it is called first philosophy.
          Nevertheless it is learned after physics and the other sciences,
          because intellectual thinking is the terminus of rational thinking.
          For this reason it is called <i>metaphysics</i>, as if to say
          <i>beyond physics</i>, for in the process of analysis it comes after
          physics.

          lt seems that in divine science we must turn to images, for:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. Divine science was never more appropriately taught than in Sacred
          Scripture. But treating of the divine in Sacred Scripture we resort to
          images when divine things are described for us under sensible figures.
          Therefore in divine science we must turn to images.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Again, we grasp divine things only by the intellect; and this is
          why, as we have said, we must proceed intellectually when treating of
          them. But, as the Philosopher says, it is impossible to understand
          without the imagination. Therefore in divine science we must resort to
          images.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Again, we know the divine especially through divine illumination.
          But as Dionysius says, “It is impossible for the divine light to
          illumine us from above unless it be hidden within the covering of many
          sacred veils.” And he calls these sacred veils “images of sensible
          things.” So in divine science we must turn to images.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Again. when dealing with what is sensible we must make use of the
          imagination. But we know divine things from sensible effects,
          according to the statement of the Epistle to the Romans: “The
          invisible things of God... are clearly seen, being understood by the
          things that are made.” Therefore in divine science we must resort to
          images.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. Again, in cognitive matters we are guided especially by the
          starting point of knowledge; for instance in the sciences of nature we
          are guided by the senses, from which our knowledge begins. Now in us
          intellectual knowledge begins in the imagination, since images are
          related to our intellect as colors to sight, as the
          <i>De Anima</i> says. Therefore in divine science we must go to the
          imagination.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          6. Again, since the intellect does not use a bodily organ, an injury
          to such an organ hinders the action of the intellect only insofar as
          it turns to the imagination. Now the intellect is hindered in its
          consideration of divine things through an injury of a bodily organ,
          namely the brain. Therefore in considering divine things the intellect
          resorts to the imagination.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">On the contrary,</span> Dionysius says
          in his <i>Mystical Theology</i>, speaking to Timothy: “O beloved
          Timothy, in mystic contemplation abandon the senses.” But the
          imagination has to do only with the sensible, for it is a movement
          produced by the sense in act, as the <i>De Anima</i> says. Therefore,
          since the considerations of divine things are eminently mystical, we
          should not have recourse to images in them.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, in the procedure of any science we should avoid what leads
          to error in it. But, as Augustine says, the principal error regarding
          divine things is the mistake of those who try transfer to them what
          they know of the corporeal world. Therefore, since the imagination has
          to do only with the corporeal, it seems that in divine science we
          should not go to images.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, as is clear from Boethius, a lower power does not extend to
          that which is proper to a higher power. But it belongs to an intellect
          and to an intelligence to know the divine and the spiritual, as is sid
          in the <i>De Spiritu et Anima.</i> Therefore, since, as is said in the
          same work, imagination is below intelligence and intellect, it seems
          that in the domain of the divine and the spiritual we should no go to
          the imagination.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply:</span> In all knowledge two
          factors must be taken into account: the beginning and the end.
          Knowledge begins with apprehension but it ends with judgment, for it
          is there that knowledge is completed.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Now all our knowledge begins in the senses; from sense perception
          results the apprehension of the imagination (which is a movement
          arising from sensory knowledge, as the Philosopher says), and from it
          in turn springs our intellectual apprehension, for images are like
          objects to the intellectual soul, as is clear in the <i>De Anima</i>.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But knowledge does not always terminate in the same way. Sometimes it
          terminates in the senses, sometimes in the imagination, and sometimes
          in the intellect alone. In some cases the properties and accidents of
          a thing disclosed by the senses adequately reveal its nature, and then
          the intellect’s judgment of that nature must conform to what the
          senses reveal about it. All natural things, which are bound up with
          sensible matter, are of this kind. So the terminus of knowledge in
          <i>natural science</i> must be in the
          <span style="font-weight: bold">senses</span>, with the result that we
          judge of natural beings as the senses manifest them, as is evident in
          the <i>De Caelo et Mundo</i>. Accordingly, the man who neglects the
          senses when dealing with natural things falls into error. By natural
          things I mean those that are bound up with sensible matter and motion
          both in existence and in thought.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Our judgment about some things, however, does not depend upon what the
          sense perceives, because even though they exist in sensible matter
          they abstract from it when their essences are defined, and we judge of
          anything chiefly according to the definition of its essence. But
          because they do not abstract from every kind of matter when their
          essences are defined but only from sensible matter, and because an
          object for the imagination remains after sensible characteristics have
          been set aside, we must judge about such things according to what the
          <span style="font-weight: bold">imagination</span> reveals. Now the
          objects of <i>mathematics</i> are of this kind. Accordingly, the
          knowledge we have through judgment in mathematics must terminate in
          the imagination and not in the senses, because mathematical judgment
          goes beyond sensory perception. Thus, the judgment about a
          mathematical line is not always the same as that about a sensible
          line. For example, that a straight line touches a sphere at only one
          point is true of an abstract straight line but not of a straight line
          in matter, as is said in the <i>De Anima</i>.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          There are other beings, however, that transcend both that which falls
          under the senses and that which falls under the imagination; namely,
          those that are entirely independent of matter both with respect to
          their being and with respect to their being understood. So, when we
          know things of this kind through judgment, our knowledge must
          <span style="font-weight: bold"
            >terminate neither in the imagination nor in the senses</span
          >.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Nevertheless we reach some knowledge of them through the objects of
          the senses and the imagination, either by way of
          <span style="font-weight: bold">causality</span> (as when from an
          effect we come to know its cause, which is not proportionate to the
          effect but transcends it), or by way of
          <span style="font-weight: bold">transcendence</span>, or by way of
          <span style="font-weight: bold">negation</span> (as when we separate
          from such beings whatever the sense or imagination apprehends). These
          are the means of knowing divine things from the sensible world
          proposed by Dionysius in his <i>Divine Names</i>.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          It follows that we can use the senses and the imagination (+) as the
          <span style="font-weight: bold">starting points</span> but not (~) as
          the <span style="font-weight: bold">termini</span> of our knowledge of
          divine things, so that we judge them to be the sort of objects the
          sense or the imagination apprehends. Now to go to something is to
          terminate at it. Therefore, we should go neither to the imagination
          nor to the senses in divine science, to the imagination and not to the
          senses in mathematics, and to the senses in the natural sciences. For
          this reason they aree in error who try to proceed in the same way in
          these three parts of speculative science.

          intellect may stop with them, but that it may rise from them to the
          immaterial world. Thus, as Dionysius says, it even teaches the divine
          through symbols of base objects in order to offer less occasion of
          stopping with them.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 2.</span> The operation of
          our intellect in its present state is never without an image as
          regards the beginning of knowledge. But our knowledge need not always
          terminate at images, so that, in other words, we judge the objects of
          our understanding to be of the same kind as the objects of the
          imagination.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 3.</span> The text of
          Dionysius refers to the beginning of knowledge and not to its end,
          which is reached when we know divine things from their sensible
          effects by the three methods described above; but not in such a way
          that we must form our judgment of the divine according to the manner
          of being of these sensible effects.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 4.</span> That argument is
          valid when the starting point of knowledge adequately leads to the
          object we seek to know. This is the way the senses are the starting
          point in the natural sciences, but not, as we have said, in divine
          science.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply to 5.</span> An image is the
          starting point of our knowledge, for it is that from which the
          operation of the intellect begins; not that it passes away, but it
          remains as the foundation of intellectual activity, just as the
          principles of demonstration must remain throughout the whole process
          of science. This is because images are related to the intellect as
          objects in which it sees whatever it sees, either through a perfect
          representation or through a negation. Consequently, when our knowledge
          of images is impeded, we must be completely incapable of knowing
          anything with our intellect even about divine things. Clearly, we
          cannot know that God causes bodies, or transcends all bodies, or is
          not a body, if we do not form an image of bodies; but our judgment of
          what is divine is not made according to the imagination. Consequently,
          even though in our present state of life the imagination is necessary
          in all our knowledge of the divine, with regard to such matters we
          must never terminate in it.

          It seems that we are unable to behold the divine form itself, at least
          in this life, for:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. As Dionysius says, “If anyone seeing God understood what he saw, he
          did not see God himself but one of his creations.” Now the divine form
          is God himself. Therefore we are not able to behold the divine form
          itself.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Again, the divine form is the divine essence itself. Now no one in
          the present life can see God through his essence. Therefore neither
          can he behold the divine form.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Again, if we see the form of something, we have some knowledge of
          that thing. But according to Dionysius, our intellect is most united
          to God when it knows absolutely nothing of him. Therefore we are
          unable to behold the divine form.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Again, as was said above, all our knowledge begins from the senses.
          But what we perceive by the senses is inadequate to reveal the divine
          form or even the other separate substances. Therefore we are unable to
          behold the divine form itself.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. Again, according to the Philosopher, our intellect is related to
          what is most evident as the eye of an owl to the sun. But the eye of
          an owl cannot see the sun at all. Therefore neither can our intellect
          see the divine form itself or other separate forms, which are nature’s
          most evident beings.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">On the contrary,</span> the Apostle
          says in the Epistle to the Romans: “The invisible things of God are
          clearly seen by a creature of the world” (that is, by man), “...his
          eternal power also and divinity.” Now the divine form is simply the
          divinity itself. Therefore in some way we can know the divine form
          with our intellect.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, commenting on the text of Genesis, “I have seen God face to
          face,” the gloss of Gregory says, “Unless a person somehow beheld it”
          (namely, divine truth), “he would not feel himself incapable of
          beholding it.” But we feel that we cannot perfectly see the divine
          essence. Therefore in some way we do behold it.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, Dionysius says that “the human mind gradually becomes
          accustomed to rise from the world of sense to heights beyond this
          world,” which are nothing else than the separate forms. Therefore we
          can somehow know the separate forms.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <i>Reply:</i> We know a thing in two ways: in one way when we know
          <i>that it is</i>, and in another way when we know <i>what it is</i>.
          Now in order to know <i>what</i> anything is, our intellect must
          penetrate its quiddity or essence either directly or by means of other
          things that adequately reveal its quiddity. But in this life our
          intellect cannot directly penetrate the essence of God or other
          separate essences, because it directly extends to images, to which it
          bears the same relation as sight does to color, as the
          <i>De Anima</i> says. So the intellect can directly conceive the
          quiddity of a sensible reality but not of an intelligible reality.
          Thus Dionysius says, “According to our way of knowing, we cannot
          immediately attain to the contemplation of the invisible.” There are
          some invisible things, however, whose quiddity or nature is perfectly
          revealed by the known quiddities of sensible things; and we can also
          know what these intelligible objects are, although indirectly. For
          instance, from the fact that we know what man and animal are, we come
          to know adequately the relation of one to the other, and from this we
          know what a genus and a species are.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          But the sensible natures known to us do not adequately reveal the
          divine essence or even other separate essences, since naturally
          considered they do not belong to one genus; and <i>quiddity</i> and
          all such terms predicated almost equivocally of sensible things and of
          these substances. That is why Dionysius calls the likenesses of
          sensible things, transferred to immaterial substances, “unlike
          likenesses, which intellectual beings participate in one way and
          sensible beings in another.” Consequently, we cannot have adequate
          knowledge of the former from the latter by way of likeness or even by
          way of causality, because the effects of those substances found in
          lower beings do not measure up to their powers so that we can come to
          know the essence of their cause in this way.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Accordingly, in the present life it is absolutely impossible to know
          the essence of immaterial substances, not only (~) by natural
          knowledge but also (~) by revelation; for, as Dionysius say, the light
          of divine revelation comes to us adapted to our condition. Thus even
          though revelation elevates us to know something of which we should
          otherwise be ignorant, it does not elevate us to know in any other way
          than through sensible things. Thus Dionysius says: “It is impossible
          for the divine light to illumine us from above unless it be hidden
          within the covering of many sacred veils.” Now knowledge by way of the
          sensible is inadequate to enable us to know the essences of immaterial
          substances. So we conclude that we do not know <i>what</i> immaterial
          forms are, but only <i>that</i> they are, whether by natural reason
          based upon created effects or even by revelation, by means of
          likenesses taken from sensible things.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          It should be noticed, however, that we cannot know <i>that</i> a thing
          is without knowing in some way <i>what</i> it is, either perfectly or
          at least confusedly, as the Philosopher says we know things defined
          before we know the parts of their definition. For if a person knows
          that man exists and wants to find out what man is by definition, he
          must know the meaning of the term “man.” And this is possible only if
          he somehow forms a concept of what he knows to exist, even though he
          does not know its definition. That is to say, he forms a concept of
          man by knowing a proximate or remote genus and accidental
          characteristics which reveal him externally. For our knowledge of
          definitions, like that of demonstrations, must begin with some
          previous knowledge.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Similarly, therefore, we cannot know <i>that</i> God and other
          immaterial substances exist unless we know somehow, in some confused
          way, <i>what</i> they are. (~) Now we cannot do this by knowing a
          proximate or remote <span style="font-weight: bold">genus</span>, for
          God is in no genus, since his essence is not distinct from his being;
          a condition required in all genera, as Avicenna says. Created
          immaterial substances, however, are indeed in a genus; but even though
          from the viewpoint of logic they share the same remote genus of
          substance with sensible substances, from the viewpoint of physics they
          do not belong to the same genus, as neither do heavenly and
          terrestrial bodies. For the corruptible and the incorruptible do not
          belong to the same genus, as the <i>Metaphysics</i> says. For the
          logician considers concepts in themselves; and from this point of view
          nothing prevents the immaterial and the material, or the incorruptible
          and the corruptible, from having something in common. But the
          philosopher of nature and the metaphysician treat of essences as
          existing in reality; and therefore they say that there are different
          genera wherever they find diverse modes of potency and act, and
          consequently diverse modes of being. Neither has God any accidental
          characteristics, as we will prove later. If other immaterial
          substances have such characteristics, we do not know them.
          Accordingly, we cannot say that we know immaterial substances
          obscurely by knowing their genus and observable accidents.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Instead of knowing the genus of these substances, we know them (+) by
          <span style="font-weight: bold">negations</span>; for example, by
          understanding that they are immaterial, incorporeal, without shapes,
          and so on. The more negations we know of them the less vaguely we
          understand them, for subsequent negations limit and determine a
          previous negation as differences do a remote genus. Our knowledge of
          the heavenly bodies is also negative for the most part, because they
          belong to a different genus from that of inferior bodies. We know, for
          instance, that they are not light or heavy, or hot or cold. And
          instead of accidental characteristics in these substances we have
          their connections with sensible ones, either with regard to (+) the
          relationship of <span style="font-weight: bold">cause</span> to effect
          or with regard to (+) the relationship of
          <span style="font-weight: bold">transcendence</span>.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          We conclude, then, that in the case of immaterial forms we know
          <i>that</i> they exist; and instead of knowing <i>what</i> they are we
          have knowledge of them by way of negation, by way of causality, and by
          way of transcendence. These are the same ways Dionysius proposes in
          his <i>Divine Names</i>; and this is how Boethius understands that we
          can know the divine form by removing all images, and not that we know
          that it is. The solution of the opposing arguments is clear from what
          has been said: for the first arguments are based on perfect knowledge
          of what a thing is, the others on imperfect knowledge of the sort
          described.

          It seems that we can come to behold the divine form through the
          speculative sciences, for:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          1. As Boethius says here, theology is a part of speculative science.
          But, as he says, it belongs to theology to behold the divine form
          itself. Therefore we can arrive at a knowledge of that form through
          the speculative sciences.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          2. Again, there is a speculative science treating of immaterial
          substances, namely divine science. Now any science treating of a
          substance beholds the form of that substance, because all knowledge is
          by means of form, and according to the Philosopher all demonstration
          begins with essence. Therefore we can behold separate forms through
          the speculative sciences.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          3. Again, according to the philosophers, the ultimate happiness of man
          is to understand the separate substances For, since happiness is the
          most perfect activity, it must have to do with the most excellent
          things falling under the intellect, as we can learn from the
          Philosopher in the Ethics. Now the happiness described by the
          philosophers is an activity springing from wisdom, since wisdom is the
          most perfect virtue of the most perfect power ─ the intellect; and, as
          the <i>Ethics</i> says, this activity is happiness. Through wisdom,
          therefore, we understand the separate substances. Now wisdom is a
          speculative science, as is clear in the <i>Metaphysics</i> and
          <i>Ethics</i>. So we can understand the separate substances through
          the speculative sciences.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          4. Again, if something is unable to reach the end for which it exists
          it is to no purpose. But the inquiry in all the speculative sciences
          is directed to a knowledge of the separate substances as to its end,
          because in any class of things the most perfect is the goal [of all
          the rest], Therefore if substances of this sort cannot be understood
          through the speculative sciences, all of them would be to no purpose,
          which is absurd.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          5. Again, everything directed by nature to an end has been previously
          endowed with principles by which it is able to arrive at that end and
          by which it also tends toward that end; for the Principles of natural
          motions are within a thing. Now the end of man to which he is directed
          by nature is to know the immaterial substances, as both the saints and
          the philosophers teach. So man is naturally endowed with principles of
          that knowledge. But everything we can arrive at from naturally known
          principles is included in one of the speculative sciences. Therefore
          the knowledge of immaterial substances pertains to some speculative
          sciences.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          <span style="font-weight: bold">On the contrary,</span> the
          Commentator says that there are two possible consequences of this
          position. (1) Either the speculative
          <span style="font-weight: bold">sciences are not yet perfect</span>,
          because we have not discovered the sciences by which we can know the
          separate substances, and this owing to the fact we do not yet
          understand these substances because of our ignorance of some
          principles; or (2) if it happens because of some
          <span style="font-weight: bold">defect in our nature</span> that we
          cannot discover the speculative sciences by which these substances may
          be known, it follows that, if some men can discover these sciences, we
          and they are men only in an equivocal sense.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          The first of these is improbable; the second is impossible. So we
          cannot understand these substances through some speculative sciences.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, in the speculative sciences we search after
          <span style="font-weight: bold">definitions</span>, by which we
          understand the essences of things through the division of a genus into
          differences and through the examination of a thing’s causes and
          accidents, which contribute a great deal to our knowledge of the
          essence. But we cannot know these in the case of immaterial
          substances, because, as we have already said, from the viewpoint of
          physics they have no (~)
          <span style="font-weight: bold">genus</span> in common with the
          sensible substances known to us. And either they do not have a (~)
          <span style="font-weight: bold">cause</span>, as in the case of God,
          or their cause is deeply hidden from us, as in the case of the angels,
          Their (~) <span style="font-weight: bold">accidents</span> are also
          unknown to us. So there can be no speculative science through which we
          may come to understand immaterial substances.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          Moreover, in the speculative sciences we know the essences of things
          through definitions. Now a definition is a phrase made up of a genus
          and differences. But the essences of these substances are simple and
          there is no composition in their quiddities, as is clear from the
          Philosopher and the Commentator. So we cannot understand these
          substances through the speculative sciences.

          <span style="font-weight: bold">Reply:</span> In the speculative
          sciences we always proceed from something previously known, both in
          demonstrating propositions and also in finding definitions. For just
          as one comes to know a conclusion by means of propositions previously
          known, so also from the concept of a genus and difference and from the
          causes of a thing he comes to know its species. But it is impossible
          to go on to infinity in this case, because then all science would
          cease, both as regards demonstrations and as regards definitions,
          since the infinite cannot be traversed. So inquiry in all the
          speculative sciences works back to something first given, which one
          does not have to learn or discover (otherwise he would have to go on
          to infinity), but which he knows naturally. Such are the
          indemonstrable principles of demonstration (for example, Every whole
          is greater than its part, and the like), to which all demonstrations
          in the sciences are reducible. Such, too, are the first conceptions of
          the intellect (for example, being, one, and the like), to which all
          definitions in the sciences must be reduced.

        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
          From this it is clear that the only things we can know in the
          speculative sciences, either through demonstration or definition, are
          those that lie within the range of these naturally known principles.
          Now these principles are revealed to man by the light of the agent
          intellect, which is something natural to him; and this light makes
          things known to us only to the extent that it renders
          <span style="font-weight: bold">images</span> actually intelligible;
          for in this consists the operation of the agent intellect, as the
          <i>De Anima</i> says. Now images are
          <span style="font-weight: bold">taken from the senses</span>. So our
          knowledge of the above-mentioned principles begins in the senses and
          memory, as is evident from the Philosopher. Consequently, these
          principles do not carry us beyond that which we can know from the
          objects grasped by the senses.

          Now we cannot know the essence of the separate substances through that
          which we take from the senses. This is clear from what was said above.
          But through sensible things we can arrive at a knowledge of the
          existence of these substances and of some of their characteristics. So
          we cannot know the quiddity of any separate substance by means of a
          speculative science, though the speculative sciences enable us to know
          the existence of these substances and some of their traits; for
          instance, that they are intellectual, incorruptible, and the like.
          This is also the teaching of the Commentator. Avempace (Ibn-Bajja) was
          of the opposite opinion; he thought that the quiddities of sensible
          things adequately reveal immaterial quiddities; but, as the
          Commentator says, this is clearly false, because quiddity is
          predicated of both almost in an equivocal sense.

          knowable to us through themselves; and in clarifying them the
          speculative sciences use the definitions of these objects to
          demonstrate their properties, as in the case of the sciences that
          demonstrate through causes. Other things are not knowable to us
          through themselves but through their effects. If the effect is
          proportionate to its cause, we take the quiddity itself of the effect
          as our starting point to prove that the cause exists and to
          investigate its quiddity, from which in turn its properties are
          demonstrated. But if the effect is not proportionate to its cause, we
          take the definition of the effect as the starting point to prove only
          the existence of the cause and some of its properties, while the
          quiddity of the cause remains unknown. This is what happens in the
          case of the separate substances.

          twofold. One is the imperfect happiness found in this life, of which
          the Philosopher speaks, and this consists in contemplating the
          separate substances through the habit of wisdom. But this
          contemplation is imperfect and such as is possible in our present
          life, not such that we can know their quiddity. The other is the
          perfect happiness of heaven, where we will see God himself through his
          essence and the other separate substances. But this happiness will not
          come through a speculative science; it will come through the light of
          glory.

          principles by which we can prepare for that perfect knowledge of
          separate substances but not with principles by which to reach it. For
          even though by his nature man is inclined to his ultimate end, he
          cannot reach it by nature but only by grace, and this owing to the
          loftiness of that end.
