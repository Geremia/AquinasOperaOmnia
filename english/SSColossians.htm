                        1. – This passage is appropriate to the subject matter
                        of this letter to the Colossians, because this present
                        life is a battle waged by soldiers who live in a camp:
                        “The life of man on earth is a war” (Job 7:1). And so
                        the place where the faithful live is called a camp. And
                        the Church is like a camp: “This is the camp of God”
                        (Gen 32:2). This camp is attacked in three ways. First,
                        by those aggressors who openly rise against the Church:
                        “They marched up over the broad earth and surrounded the
                        camp of the saints and the beloved city” (Rev. 20:9).
                        Secondly, this camp is deceitfully undermined by
                        heretics: “By fair and flattering words they deceive the
                        hearts of the simple-minded” (Rom 16:18); “Evil men and
                        imposters; will go from bad to worse, deceivers and
                        deceived” (2 Tim 3:13). Thirdly, it is attacked by some
                        of its own members who have become depraved from sins
                        that spring from the corruption of the flesh: “The
                        desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the
                        desires of the Spirit are against the flesh” as we read
                        in Galatians (5:17); “For we are not contending against
                        flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against
                        the powers, against the world rulers of this present
                        darkness” (Eph 6:12). In this war the prelates of the
                        Church are our leaders: according to the Psalm “The
                        princes of Judah are their leaders” (Ps 68:27). It is
                        their duty to protect the camp of the Church against all
                        these attacks. First, against sins, by encouraging the
                        people: “Declare to my people their transgression, to
                        the house of Jacob their sins” (Is 58:1). Secondly,
                        against heretics, by their sound teaching: “He must hold
                        firm to the sure word as taught, so that he may be able
                        to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to
                        confute those who contradict it” (Tit 1:9). Thirdly,
                        they should protect the Church against those who
                        persecute it by giving an example of patient suffering.
                        This is the way Paul protected the Church with his
                        spiritual sword, because in his letters he combated sin,
                        refuted heresies, and encouraged patience. As to the
                        first: “But immorality and all impurity or covetousness
                        must not even be named among you, as is fitting among
                        saints” (Eph 5:3). As to the second: “As for a man that
                        is factious, after admonishing him once or twice, have
                        nothing more to do with him” (Tit 3:10). As to the
                        third, the entire eleventh chapter of his second letter
                        to the Corinthians shows how he encouraged them to be
                        patient.
                      </p>

                        2. – The passage quoted at the beginning mentions two of
                        these matters: the condition of the Church, when it
                        says, camp, and the zeal of the Apostle, when it says,
                        protected. Now a camp has to be alert in order to avoid
                        evil: “Your camp must be holy” (Dt. 23:14); and it
                        should have a good relationship with its leader and in
                        itself: “This is the camp of God” (Gen. 32:21). It
                        should also be a threat to the enemy: “Terrible as an
                        army with banners” (Sg. 6:10). Now the Apostle was alert
                        in protecting them, like a shepherd, whose duty is to
                        carefully lead his sheep so they are not lost. “He goes
                        before them, and the sheep follow him” (Jn. 10:4). The
                        Apostle did act this way: “Be imitators of me, as I am
                        of Christ” (1 Cor. 4:16). A shepherd should also feed
                        his flock generously, so they do not become ill: “Tend
                        the flock of God that is your charge” (1 Pet. 5:2). And
                        the Apostle did this also: “I fed you with milk” (1 Cor.
                        3:2). A shepherd should also bravely defend his flock,
                        so they will not be destroyed: “Do not seek to become a
                        judge, lest you be unable to remove iniquity” (Sir.
                        7:6); “Your servant used to keep sheep for his father;
                        and when there came a lion or a bear, and took a lamb
                        from the flock, I went after him and delivered it out of
                        his mouth” (1 Sam. 17:34). And so our beginning text
                        says that the Apostle protected the camp, that is, God’s
                        Church, with a sword, which is the word of God: “The
                        word of God is living and active, sharper then any
                        two-edged sword” (Heb. 4:12). Here, then, is the subject
                        matter of this letter. In his letter to the Ephesians,
                        the Apostle described the nature of the Church’s unity;
                        and in the letter to the Philippians, he showed its
                        growth and preservation. But in this letter he is
                        dealing with its protection from those heretics who were
                        corrupting and misleading the Colossians.

                        1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
                        and Timothy our brother, 2 To the saints and faithful
                        brethren in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace
                        from God our Father.

                        3. – This letter is divided into its greeting and its
                        message (1:3). First, the persons sending the letter are
                        mentioned; then, the ones to whom it is sent (1:2); and
                        thirdly, the good things desired for the latter (1:2b).
                        As to the first, the principal sender is mentioned; and
                        secondly, his companion.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        4. – The principal sender of this letter is first
                        identified by his name, Paul, that is, one who is
                        humble, for it is such persons who receive wisdom: “Thou
                        hast hidden these things from the wise and understanding
                        and revealed them to babes” (Mt 11:25), and so Paul can
                        teach this wisdom. Secondly, the sender is described by
                        his office, namely, an apostle, that is, one who is
                        sent, to bring salvation to the faithful: “Set apart for
                        me Saul and Barnabas for the work to which I have called
                        them” (Acts 13:2); “As the Father has sent me, even so I
                        send you” (Jn 20:21). He is not the apostle of just
                        anyone, but of Christ Jesus, whose glory he seeks, and
                        not his own: “For what we preach is not ourselves, but
                        Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants
                        for Jesus’ sake” (2 Cor. 4:5). But at times some reach
                        their office because God is angry because of a people’s
                        sins: “Who makes a man who is a hypocrite to reign for
                        the sins of the people” (Job 34:30); “I have given you
                        kings in my anger” (Hos 13:11). And so Paul says that he
                        has his office by the will of God, that is, by his
                        pleasure: “I will give you shepherds after my own heart,
                        who will feed you with knowledge and understanding” (Jer
                        3:15).
                      </p>

                        5. – The other person to send this letter is Timothy our
                        brother, so that there may be two or three witnesses, as
                        in Deuteronomy (17:6). “A brother helped is like a
                        strong city” (Pr 18:19).
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        6. – The persons to whom this letter is sent are the
                        saints and faithful brethren at Colossae. The greater
                        ones are called saints: “Let us serve him in holiness
                        and righteousness” (Lk 1:74); and the lesser ones are
                        referred to as the faithful, who have at least kept the
                        true faith, because “without faith it is impossible to
                        please God” (Heb 11:6). Or we could say, to the saints,
                        that is, to those sanctified by baptism, and faithful
                        brethren, that is, those who have remained in the faith
                        they accepted: “A faithful man will be much praised,” as
                        we read in Proverbs (28:20).
                      </p>

                        7. – Then he mentions the good things he wishes them to
                        have: that is, grace, which is the source of every good:
                        “Justified by his grace as a gift” (Rom 3:24); and
                        peace, which is the last of all goods: “He makes peace
                        in your borders” (Ps 147:14). As a consequence, he
                        wishes them all the goods that lie between these two.
                        “The Lord will give grace and glory” (Ps 84:11). From
                        the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that is, the Father
                        of Christ by nature, and our Father by grace; and from
                        the Lord Jesus Christ [Vulgate]. And so, from our
                        Father, that is, God in his Trinity, and from the Lord

                        3 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus
                        Christ, when we pray for you, 4 because we have heard of
                        your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you
                        have for all the saints, 5 because of the hope laid up
                        for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in the
                        word of the truth, the gospel 6 which has come to you,
                        as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and
                        growing—so among yourselves, from the day you heard and
                        understood the grace of God in truth, 7 as you learned
                        it from Epaphras our beloved fellow servant. He is a
                        faithful minister of Christ on your behalf 8 and has
                        made known to us your love in the Spirit.
                      </p>

                        8. – Here Paul begins his message. First, he commends
                        the truth of the Gospel; secondly, he defends this
                        against those who attack it (in the second chapter). In
                        regard to the first he does two things. First, he
                        commends the truth of faith in the Gospel; and secondly,
                        its Author (1:15), The first is divided into two parts.
                        First, he thanks God for the benefits conferred on the
                        Colossians in particular; and secondly, for those
                        benefits granted to the Church in general (1:12). In
                        regard to the first he does two things. First, he thanks
                        God, and secondly, he shows why he gives thanks (1.14).
                        Again the first is divided into two parts. First, he
                        gives thanks; secondly, he prays (13b).

                        “Give thanks in all circumstances” (1 Th 5:18). And we
                        thank God always, for the past and for the future. For
                        although we cannot actually pray every minute, we should
                        always pray by serving God out of love: “Pray
                        constantly” (1 Th 5:17); “We ought always to pray” (Lk
                        18:1).

                        First, he recalls the blessings they have; and secondly,
                        how they were obtained (1:5b).
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        11. – Our blessings or goods consist especially in
                        faith, hope, and the love of charity: for by faith we
                        have a knowledge of God; by hope we are raised up to
                        him; but by the love of charity we are united to him. As
                        we read: “So faith, hope, love, abide, these three; but
                        the greatest of these is love” (1 Cor. 13:13). So he
                        gives thanks for these three. First, that they have the
                        faith; although he was not the one who preached to them,
                        but rather a disciple by the name of Epaphras, and later
                        Archippus. Thus he says, we have heard of your faith,
                        which is the beginning of the spiritual life: “The
                        righteous shall live by his faith” (Hab 2:4); “For
                        whoever would draw near to God must believe that he
                        exists and that he rewards those who seek him” (Heb
                        11:6). But this faith is dead without an active love, as
                        James says (2:26), and so an active love must also be
                        present: “For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
                        counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new
                        creation” (Gal 6:15). And so he continues, and of the
                        love which you have for all the saints. There is a love
                        which springs from charity, and another which is
                        worldly. This worldly love does not include everyone,
                        because we love those with whom there is some
                        communication or sharing, which is the cause of love;
                        but in worldly love this cause is not present in
                        everyone, but is only found in one’s relatives or other
                        worldly people. But the love of charity does extend to
                        everyone; and so he says, for all. For even though
                        sinners are loved by the love of charity, it is in order
                        that at some time they become holy: “We know that we
                        have passed out of death into life, because we love the
                        brethren” (1 Jn 3:14). Further, the fruit of worldly
                        love is obtained in this world; but the fruit of the
                        love of charity is in eternal life. This leads him to
                        mention hope: because of the hope laid up for you in
                        heaven, that is, because of your eternal glory, which is
                        called hope because it is considered as certain: “This
                        hope has been put in my heart,” as we read in Job
                        (19:27) [Vulgate].

                        12. – Then (1:5b), he shows how they obtained these
                        things. First, he commends the doctrine of the Gospel;
                        and secondly, its ministry. First he commends the truth
                        of the doctrine; secondly, its growth (v. 6); thirdly,
                        its fruitful progress (v. 6b).

                        13. – So he says, of this you have heard, that is, of
                        the hope or else of the things hoped for, in the word of
                        the truth, the Gospel, for this is greater than
                        everything else: “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor
                        the heart of man conceived what God has prepared for
                        those who love him” (1 Cor. 2:9). Therefore, God
                        revealed this: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at
                        hand” (Mt 3:2). But his hope is true, and not a vain
                        hope (as when the one promising is a liar), because it
                        is in the word of the truth: “Your word is truth” (Jn
                        17:17).

                        14. – Then when he says, which has come to you, Christ’s
                        doctrine is commended for its growth, because it has
                        come not only to you, but is indeed in the whole world:
                        “Their voice goes out through all the earth, and their
                        words to the end of the world” (Ps 19:4); “This Gospel
                        of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole
                        world... and then the end will come” (Mt 24:14). But
                        since the Gospel has been preached in the whole world,
                        why has the end not come? I answer that some say that
                        the Gospel of Christ is not the Gospel of the kingdom.
                        But this is false, because our Lord calls it the Gospel
                        of the kingdom. And so, according to Chrysostom, we
                        should say that while the apostles were still alive, the
                        Gospel of Christ was throughout the whole world, at
                        least by some kind of report. And it is quite miraculous
                        that Christ’s doctrine should have grown so much in
                        forty years. And so the Apostle says, in the whole
                        world, that is, by report; and “then the end will come,”
                        that is, the destruction of Jerusalem. But Augustine
                        does not agree with this interpretation, because even in
                        his own time there were some countries in which there
                        were yet no churches. So he says the time referred to is
                        the time when the Gospel will be really preached. Thus
                        the end will come after the Church has become
                        established in all countries, even though some people
                        are not believers. And this end is not at the time of
                        the Apostle, but concerns the end of the world. And so
                        when Paul says here, in the whole world, he is speaking
                        of the future; but he is using the present tense because
                        the outcome is so certain. Yet we can say that the
                        Gospel is in the whole world by report, although it is
                        not actually established in all places.

                        15. – Then he commends Christ’s doctrine because of its
                        fruit in good works: it is bearing fruit: “My blossoms
                        became glorious and abundant fruit” (Sir 24:17); “He
                        indeed bears fruit, and yields, in one case a
                        hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty”
                        (Mt 13:23), and it is growing, that is, in the number of
                        its believers: “The Lord added to their number day by
                        day those who were being saved” (Acts 2:47). This was
                        the effect of a great power, because as among
                        yourselves, so also among others. From the day you
                        heard, that is, the preaching, and understood, you
                        accepted it.

                        to himself; then in relation to them; and finally in
                        relation to both. So he says: You have been taught the
                        Gospel, as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved
                        fellow servant: “I am a fellow servant with you and your
                        brethren the prophets” (Rev 22:9). He is a faithful
                        minister, that is, one who does not seek his own profit:
                        “This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ
                        and stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover, it is
                        required of stewards that they be found trustworthy” (1
                        Cor. 4:1). He is a faithful minister, that is, a
                        mediator between them and the Apostle, and has made
                        known, i.e., indicated, to us your love in the Spirit.

                        thanks; here he states his prayer, showing what he is
                        asking for them. First, he gives the characteristics of
                        prayer; secondly, he mentions the goods he is asking for
                        (v. 9b).

                        18. – Prayer has three characteristics. First, it is
                        timely, thus he says, from the day we heard of it we
                        began to pray: “Since I spoke of him, I will still
                        remember him” (Jer 31:20). Secondly, it is continuous:
                        we have not ceased to pray for you: “Far be it from me
                        that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray
                        for you” (1 Sam 12:23); “Without ceasing I mention you
                        always in my prayers” (Rom. 1:9). Thirdly, prayer has
                        several elements and is complete: to pray for... asking.
                        Praying is lifting our minds up to God; and asking is
                        requesting things. Praying should come first, so that
                        the one devoutly requesting is heard, just as those who
                        are requesting something begin by trying to persuade
                        their listener and bend him to their wishes. But we
                        should begin with devotion and meditation on God and
                        divine things, not in order to bend him, but to lift
                        ourselves up to him.

                        19. – He asks for three things. First, for a knowledge
                        of the truth; secondly, that they act in a virtuous way
                        (v. 10); and thirdly, that they have the endurance to
                        stand up under evil (v. 11b).
                      </p>

                        20. – He requests three kinds of knowledge for them.
                        First, a knowledge of what they are to do; and so he
                        says, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his
                        will, that is, that you may fully know the will of God:
                        “This is the will of God, your sanctification,” as we
                        read in 1 Thessalonians (4:3). Thus, one who lives in a
                        holy way knows God’s will; but one who sins does not
                        know the will of God, because every sinner is ignorant:
                        “That you may prove what is the good and acceptable and
                        perfect will of God” (Rom 12:2). Secondly, he wants them
                        to have a knowledge of divine things, in all wisdom,
                        which consists in the knowledge of divine things, as
                        Augustine says: “Think of the Lord with uprightness”
                        (Wis 1:1). Thirdly, he wants them to have an
                        understanding of spiritual things, i.e., not of these
                        earthly material things: “Now we have received not the
                        spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is from God,”
                        as 1 Corinthians (2:12) says. He appropriately
                        associates wisdom and understanding, because wisdom is
                        weak when there is no understanding, as Gregory says,
                        and understanding is useless without wisdom: for wisdom
                        judges and understanding apprehends, and one cannot
                        apprehend without judging, and vice versa. The Gloss
                        says that the first kind of knowledge is taken in
                        general, the second pertains to the active life, and the
                        third to the contemplative life.

                        21. – Further, knowledge by itself is not enough,
                        because “Whoever knows what is right to do and fails to
                        do it, for him it is sin” (Jas. 4:17). And therefore, it
                        is necessary to act according to virtue. He touches on
                        this when he says, to lead a life worthy of the Lord,
                        for one lives unworthily if he does not live as is
                        fitting for a son of God to live: “As servants of God we
                        commend ourselves in every way: through great endurance,
                        in afflictions, hardships...” (2 Cor. 6:4); “As we
                        solemnly forewarned you” (1 Th 4:6). Secondly, he
                        touches on a correct intention: fully pleasing: “There
                        was one who pleased God and was loved by him” (Wis
                        4:10). Thirdly, he brings in the desire to make
                        progress: bearing fruit in every good work, for one
                        should always try for a further good: “My blossoms
                        became glorious and abundant fruit” (Sir 24:17); “The
                        return you get is sanctification and its end eternal
                        life” (Rom 6:22). And after one has borne fruit, an
                        increase in knowledge follows, and increasing in the
                        knowledge of God; for as a result of eagerly
                        accomplishing the commands of God, a person is disposed
                        for knowledge: “I understand more than the aged, because
                        I keep your precepts” (Ps 119:100); “Wisdom will not
                        dwell in a body enslaved to sin” (Wis 1:4). He says,
                        increasing in the knowledge of God, and not of the
                        world: “She gave him a knowledge of holy things” (Wis
                        10:10).
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        22. – Then he mentions their standing up under evils,
                        for to live a virtuous life it is not enough just to
                        know and to will; one must also act in spite of
                        opposition: and this cannot be done without a patient
                        endurance of evils. And so he says, may you be
                        strengthened with all power: “Rich in power” (Sir 44:6).
                        Such power, or virtue, comes from God; and so he says,
                        according to his glorious might: “Be strong in the Lord”
                        (Eph 6:10). He says, glorious might, that is, Christ’s,
                        who is the glory of the Father, because to fall into sin
                        is to fall into darkness: “She is a breath of the power
                        of God, and a pure emanation of the glory of the
                        Almighty” (Wis 7:25). Then when he says, for all
                        patience and longsuffering, he prays that they may stand
                        up under adversity. Some people fail because of the
                        difficulties of their adversities; and they need
                        patience: “By your patience you will gain your lives”
                        (Lk 21:19). Other people fail because their reward is a
                        long time coming; and so he says, longsuffering, which
                        enables a person to wait for what was promised: “It it
                        does not come soon, wait for it; because it will come
                        and not delay” (Hab 2:3); “And thus, with his
                        longsuffering, he obtained what was promised” (Heb
                        6:15). Yet, although some people do avoid these two
                        vices, they do it with sadness; and since this should
                        not be so he says, with joy: “Count it all joy, my
                        brethren, when you meet various trials” (Jas. 1:2).

                        [Vulgate], he gives thanks for the favors granted to all
                        of the faithful: first for the gift of grace, and then
                        secondly for the fruit of grace (v. 13).

                        24. – And so he says: We pray for you, giving thanks to
                        God, as our Creator, and the Father, by adopting us, who
                        has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the
                        saints in light. Some people have said that the gifts of
                        grace are given because of a person’s merit, and that
                        God gives grace to those who are worthy, and does not
                        give grace to those who are unworthy. But this view is
                        rejected by the Apostle, because whatever worth and
                        grace we have was given to us by God, and so also were
                        the effects of grace. And so Paul says, who has
                        qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints
                        in light: “Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to
                        claim anything as coming from us; our sufficiency is
                        from God” (2 Cor. 3:5). To share in the inheritance
                        [lot] of the saints in light. All men are good in their
                        very nature; consequently, they somehow partake of God.
                        But those who are wicked take pleasure in temporal
                        things as their portion: “This is our portion and this
                        our lot” (Wis 2:9), while those who are holy have God
                        himself as their portion: “The Lord is my portion” (Lam
                        3:24); “The Lord is my chosen portion” (Ps 16:5). And so
                        he says, who has qualified us to share in the lot of the
                        saints.
                      </p>

                        25. – He says, in the lot of the saints, because there
                        are two ways of apportioning things: sometimes it is
                        done by choosing, as when a person selects this portion,
                        and another one that portion; and sometimes
                        apportionment is by lot: “The lot puts and end to
                        disputes” (Pr 18:18). The saints have their portion not
                        because they chose it: “You did not choose me, but I
                        chose you” (Jn 15:16), but because God chose them. (A
                        lot consists in entrusting something to God’s judgment.
                        And there are three types of lot: consultative,
                        divining, and apportioning. The first is not evil when
                        dealing in temporal matters; the second is useless and
                        evil, and the third is sometimes allowed in cases of
                        necessity.) The portion of the saints is the possession
                        of the light: “He dwells in unapproachable light” (1 Tim
                        6.16); “In his hands he hides the light and commands it
                        to come again” (Job 36:32), and from it there follows
                        the effect of grace, i.e., our transference from
                        darkness to light.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        26. – First, he mentions this transference; and
                        secondly, the way in which men are the slaves of sin
                        before they receive grace. For since sin is a darkness,
                        men [before receiving grace] are in the power of
                        darkness, i.e., either of the evil spirits or of sins:
                        “Against the world rulers of this present darkness” (Eph
                        6:12), “Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken”
                        (Is 49:25). He has transferred us to the kingdom of his
                        beloved Son, i.e., that we might be the kingdom of God:
                        “My kingdom is not of this world” (Jn 18:36). This
                        happens when we are freed from our sins: “You have made
                        them a kingdom and priests to our God” (Rev 5:10). Or
                        literally, we are transferred to this kingdom so that we
                        may obtain eternal life: “The kingdom of heaven is at
                        hand” (Mt 3:2). And this is what he says: the kingdom of
                        his beloved Son.
                      </p>

                        27. – A more literal translation of this phrase would
                        read: the kingdom of the Son of his love. As Augustine
                        says in a Gloss, “love” is sometimes taken to mean the
                        Holy Spirit, who is the love of the Father and the Son.
                        But if “love” were always to mean this Person, then the
                        Son would be the Son of the Holy Spirit. So at other
                        times “love” is understood essentially, to indicate the
                        divine essence. Thus the phrase, of the Son of his love,
                        can be taken to mean either “of his beloved Son,” or it
                        could mean, “of the Son of his [the Father’s] essence.”
                        But is it true to say that the Son is the Son of the
                        essence of the Father? I answer that if the possessive
                        case, “of the essence” is taken to indicate the
                        relationship of an efficient cause, it is false; because
                        the essence [of the Father] does not generate nor is it
                        generated. Sometimes the possessive case indicates the
                        possession of a form, as when we say a thing is “of an
                        excellent form,” that is, it has an excellent form. And
                        if we understand “of the essence” in this way, then the
                        statement is true, that is, the Son has the essence of
                        the Father: “The Father loves the Son, and has given all
                        things into his hand” (Jn 3:35).

                        shows the way we have been transferred. For humanity in
                        sin was held down in two ways: first, as a slave: “Every
                        one who commits sin is a slave to sin” (Jn. 8:34), and
                        secondly, as deserving punishment and as turned away
                        from God: “Your iniquities have made a separation
                        between you and your God, and your sins have hid his
                        face from you so that he does not hear” (Is 59:2). But
                        these two things are taken away by Christ, because, as
                        man, he became a sacrifice for us and redeemed us in his
                        blood; and so Paul says, in whom we have redemption:
                        “You were bought with a price” (1 Cor. 6:20); and from
                        Christ, as God, we have the forgiveness of sins, because
                        he took away our debt of punishment.

                        30. – As to the first, we should note that God is said
                        to be invisible because he exceeds the capacity of
                        vision of any created intellect, so that no created
                        intellect, by its natural knowledge, can attain His
                        essence: “Behold, God is great, and we know him not”
                        (Job 36:26); “He dwells in unapproachable light” (1 Tim.
                        6:16). And therefore, he is seen by the blessed by means
                        of grace, and not by reason of their natural capacity.
                        Dionysius gives the reason for this: all knowledge
                        terminates at something which exists, that is, at some
                        nature that participates in the act of existence [esse];
                        but God is the very act of existence [ipsum esse], not
                        participating in the act of existence, but participated
                        in; and thus he is not known. It is of this invisible
                        God that the Son is the image.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        31. – Let us now see in what way the Son is called the
                        image of God, and why he is said to be invisible. The
                        notion of an image includes three things. First, an
                        image must be a likeness; secondly, it must be derived
                        or drawn from the thing of which it is a likeness; and
                        thirdly, it must be derived with respect to something
                        that pertains to the species or to a sign of the
                        species. For if two things are alike, but neither is
                        derived from the other, then neither one is the image of
                        the other; thus one egg is not said to be the image of
                        another. And so something is called an image because it
                        imitates. Further, if there is a likeness between two
                        things, but not according to species or a sign of the
                        species, we do not speak of an image. Thus, a man has
                        many accidents, such as color, size and so on; but they
                        are not the reason for calling something an image of a
                        man. But if something has the shape or figure of a man,
                        then it can be called an image, because this shape is a
                        sign of the species. Now the Son is like the Father, and
                        the Father is like the Son. But because the Son has this
                        likeness from the Father, and not the Father from the
                        Son, we, properly speaking, say that the Son is the
                        image of the Father, and not conversely: for this
                        likeness is drawn and derived from the Father. Further,
                        this likeness is according to species, because in divine
                        matters the Son is somehow, although faintly,
                        represented by our mental word. We have a mental word
                        when we actually conceive the form of the thing of which
                        we have knowledge; and then we signify this mental word
                        by an external word. And this mental word we have
                        conceived is a certain likeness, in our mind, of the
                        thing, and it is like it in species. And so the Word of
                        God is called the image of God.

                        32. – As to our second question, we should note that the
                        Arians misunderstood the text: for they thought about
                        the image of God as they did of the images they made of
                        their ancestors, so they could see in these images the
                        loved ones no longer with them (just as we make images
                        of the saints to see in these images those whom we
                        cannot see in reality). And so they said that to be
                        invisible was unique to the Father, and that the first
                        visible reality was the Son, who manifested the goodness
                        of the Father. They were saying that the Father was
                        truly invisible, but the Son was visible, and thus their
                        natures would be different. But the Apostle refutes this
                        when he says: “He reflects the glory of God and bears
                        the very stamp of his nature, upholding the universe by
                        his word of power. When he had made purification for
                        sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on
                        high” (Heb 1:3). And thus the Son is not only the image
                        of the invisible God, but he himself is invisible like
                        the Father: He is the image of the invisible God.

                        he commends Christ in relation to creatures. First he
                        does so; and secondly, he amplifies it (v. 16).
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        34. – We should note, about the first point, that the
                        Arians understood this to mean that Christ is called the
                        first-born because he is the first creature. But this is
                        not the meaning, as will be clear. So we have to
                        understand two things: how this image is generated, and
                        in what way it is the first-born of creatures.. In
                        regard to the first, we should note that things generate
                        in various ways depending on their nature and manner of
                        existence, for men generate in one way, and plants in
                        another, and so on for other things. But the nature of
                        God is his existence [ipsum esse] and his act of
                        understanding [intelligere] and so it is necessary that
                        his generating or intellectual conceiving is the
                        generating or conceiving of his nature. (In us, however,
                        our intellectual conceiving is not the conceiving of our
                        nature, because our nature is not the same as our act of
                        understanding). Therefore, since this image is a word
                        and concept of an intellect, it is necessary to say that
                        it is the offspring of the nature, so that the one
                        receiving the nature from the other is generated by
                        necessity.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        35. – Secondly, we have to understand in what way the
                        Son is called the first-born. God does not know himself
                        and creatures through two different sources; he knows
                        all things in his own essence, as in the first efficient
                        cause. The Son, however, is the intellectual concept or
                        representation of God insofar as he knows himself, and
                        as a consequence, every creature. Therefore, inasmuch as
                        the Son is begotten, he is seen as a word representing
                        every creature, and he is the principle of every
                        creature. For if he were not begotten in that way, the
                        Word of the Father would be the first-born of the Father
                        only, and not of creatures: “I came forth from the mouth
                        of the Most High, the first-born before every creature”
                        (Sir 24:5) [Vulgate].
                      </p>

                        36. – Then when he says, in him all things were created,
                        he explains what he has just said, that is, that the Son
                        is the first-born because he was generated as the
                        principle of creatures; and this with respect to three
                        things. First, with respect to the creation of things;
                        in the second place, with respect to their distinction,
                        in heaven and on earth, and thirdly, with respect to
                        their preservation in existence, and in him all things
                        hold together.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        37. – He says that the Son is the first-born of every
                        creature because he is generated or begotten as the
                        principle of every creature. And so he says, for in him
                        all things were created. With respect to this, we should
                        note that the Platonists affirmed the existence of
                        Ideas, and said that each thing came to be by
                        participating in an Idea, like the Idea of man, or an
                        Idea of some other kind. Instead of all these we have
                        one, that is, the Son, the Word of God. For an artisan
                        makes an artifact by making it participate in the form
                        he has conceived within himself, enveloping it, so to
                        say, with external matter; for we say that the artisan
                        makes a house through the form of the thing which he has
                        conceived within himself. This is the way God is said to
                        make all things in his wisdom, because the wisdom of God
                        is related to his created works just as the art of the
                        builder is to the house he has made. Now this form and
                        wisdom is the Word; and thus in him all things were
                        created, as in an exemplar: “He spoke and they were
                        made” (Gen 1), because he created all things to come
                        into existence in his eternal Word.
                      </p>

                        38. – With respect to the differences among things, we
                        should note that some, like the Manicheans, were
                        mistaken in thinking that earthly bodies, since they are
                        corruptible, were made by an evil god, while the
                        heavenly bodies, because they are incorruptible, were
                        made by the good God, that is, by the Father of Christ.
                        This was an error, because both types of bodies were
                        created in the same [Word]. And so he says, in heaven
                        and on earth. This difference is based on the different
                        parts of corporeal nature. “In the beginning,” that is,
                        in the Son, “God created the heavens and the earth” (Gen
                        1:1).

                        39. – The Platonists also said that God created
                        invisible creatures, that is, the angels, by himself,
                        but created bodily natures by the angels. But this is
                        refuted here, because Paul says, visible and invisible.
                        As to the first he says: “By faith we understand that
                        the world was framed by the word of God; that from
                        invisible things visible things might be made” (Heb
                        11:3). About the second we read. “We have seen but few
                        of his works. For the Lord has made all things, and to
                        the godly he has granted wisdom” (Sir 43:32-33). This
                        difference in things is based on the nature of created
                        things.

                        40. – The third difference is concerned with the order
                        and degrees found in invisible realities, when he says,
                        whether thrones or dominions or principalities or
                        authorities. The Platonists were mistaken in this matter
                        for they said that there are different perfections found
                        in things, and attributed each of these to its own first
                        principle. And they said there was an order of
                        principles according to the orders of these perfections.
                        Thus they affirmed a first being, from whom all things
                        participate in existence; and another principle,
                        distinct from this, a first intellect, from which all
                        things participate in intelligence, and then another
                        principle, life, from which all things participate in
                        life. But we do not agree with this, for all the
                        perfections found in things are from one principle. Thus
                        he says, whether thrones or dominions..., and so on. As
                        if to say: they do not depend on an array of principles,
                        but on the one unique Word of God.

                        41. – Why does Paul say in his letter to the Ephesians
                        (1:22) “He has made him the head over all the Church”?
                        For he does not seem to be saying the same thing there
                        as here. I reply that here Paul is giving a descending
                        list of such beings, because he is showing the
                        procession of creatures from God; but in Ephesians he
                        gives an ascending list, because he is showing that the
                        Son of God, as man, is above all creatures. In
                        Ephesians, the principalities are placed under the
                        authorities (or powers), and the virtues are between the
                        dominions and authorities; but here in our text, the
                        principalities are placed above the authorities, and
                        between the dominions and the authorities. This is the
                        way the teaching of Gregory differs from that of
                        Dionysius. For Dionysius arranges the spiritual beings
                        as they are in Ephesians, because he puts the dominions,
                        the virtues and authorities in the second hierarchy. But
                        Gregory arranges them as Paul does here, because he puts
                        the dominions, principalities and authorities in the
                        second hierarchy; and the virtues, archangels and the
                        angels in the third hierarchy. We should note, as
                        Gregory and Dionysius say, that the spiritual gifts from
                        which these different orders receive their names are
                        common to all of them; yet some orders receive their
                        name from certain of these gifts, and others receive
                        their name from different gifts. The reason for this can
                        be seen from the teachings of the Platonists: whatever
                        belongs to something belongs to it in one of three ways:
                        essentially, or by participation, or causally. A thing
                        belongs essentially to another if it belongs to it
                        according to a certain proportion to its nature; this is
                        the way to be rational belongs to man. A thing belongs
                        by participation to another if it surpasses the nature
                        of the thing which has it, although the thing
                        participates to a certain extent in it, although
                        imperfectly; thus man is intellectual by participation,
                        while to be intellectual, which is superior to being
                        rational, is in the angels essentially. One thing
                        belongs to another causally if it accrues to it, as
                        artifacts belong to a person; for they do not exist in
                        him as in matter, but exist in his artistic power. Now a
                        thing is named only from what belongs to it essentially;
                        thus we do not define man as an intellectual or artistic
                        being, but as rational. In regard to the gifts present
                        in the angels, those which belong to the higher angels
                        essentially, belong to the lower ones by participation;
                        and those which belong to the lower ones essentially,
                        are present in the higher angels causally. Consequently,
                        the higher angels receive their names from the higher
                        gifts. But the highest thing in a spiritual creature is
                        that it attain to God and somehow participate in him;
                        and therefore the higher angels receive their name
                        because they attain God: seraphim, as being fervent or
                        on fire with God; the cherubim, as knowing God; and the
                        thrones, as having God seated in them.

                        42. – For one thing can participate in another in three
                        ways: first, it can receive what is proper to the nature
                        of what it is participating in; secondly, it can receive
                        a thing insofar as it knows it; and thirdly, it can
                        somehow serve the power of a thing. For example, a
                        doctor participates in the art of medicine either
                        because he possesses in himself the art of medicine, or
                        because he has received a knowledge of the art, or
                        because he serves or devotes himself to the medical art.
                        The first way of participating is greater than the
                        second, and the second way is greater than the third. In
                        Sacred Scripture, what is divine is signified by fire:
                        “The Lord your God is a devouring fire” (Deut 4:24). And
                        so the highest order of angels is called the seraphim,
                        as though on fire with God and having a divine property.
                        The second order is the cherubim, who attain God by
                        knowledge. And the third are the thrones, who serve or
                        are devoted to his power. The other orders are not given
                        their names because they attain God, but because of some
                        activity of God. Some angels direct or command, and
                        these are the dominions. Others accomplish and carry out
                        [what is commanded], the principal angels who do this
                        are the principalities: “Princes went before, joined
                        with singers” (Ps 68:27). Among the others who carry out
                        commands, some act over spiritual creatures, such as the
                        authorities (powers), who restrain the evil spirits. If
                        some act over natural things, they are called virtues,
                        and these perform miracles. If they act over human
                        beings, they are called archangels if they are concerned
                        with great matters, and angels if concerned with lesser
                        things. And so Paul concludes, all things were created
                        through him [per ipsum], as by an efficient cause, and
                        in him [in Thomas’ text], as in an exemplary cause: “All
                        things were made through him, and without him was not
                        anything made that was made” (Jn 1:3).

                        the Apostle, says in answer: No! He is before all, i.e.,
                        that is, before all times and other things: “The Lord
                        possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he
                        made anything from the beginning” (Prov 8:22). Or, He is
                        before all in dignity: “Who among the heavenly beings is
                        like the Lord?” (Ps 89:6).

                        and in him all things hold together, that is, they are
                        conserved. For God is to things as the sun is to the
                        moon, which loses its light when the sun leaves. And so,
                        if God took his power away from us, all things would
                        immediately cease to exist: “Upholding the universe by
                        his word of power” (Heb 1:3).

                        commends him in his relationship to the Church: first,

                        things: first, he mentions Christ’s relationship to the
                        entire Church; and secondly, he explains this

                        among creatures, is the one in whom we have our
                        redemption. But because he has been made the head of the
                        Church, two things have to be explained: first, in what
                        way the Church is a body; and secondly, how Christ is
                        its head. The Church is called a body because of its
                        likeness to a single human being. This likeness is
                        twofold: first, in that it has distinct members: “And
                        his gifts were that some should be apostles, some
                        prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers”
                        (Eph 4:11); secondly, because the members of the Church
                        serve each other in ways that are different: “The
                        members may have the same care for one another” (1 Cor.
                        12:25); “Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the
                        law of Christ” (Gal 6:2). Again, just as a body is one
                        because its soul is one, so the Church is one because
                        the Spirit is one: “There is one body and one Spirit”
                        (Eph 4:4); “Because there is one bread, we who are many
                        are one body, for we all partake of the one bread” (1
                        Cor. 10:17). Next we have to consider the relationship
                        of the members to the head of the Church, i.e., to
                        Christ. For Christ is the head of the Church. “But you,
                        O Lord, are the lifter of my head” (Ps 3:3).

                        is the beginning, the first-born from the dead. The head
                        has three privileges over the other members of the body.
                        First, it is superior in dignity, because it is a source
                        and a ruler. Secondly, it has the fulness of the senses,
                        which are all in the head. Thirdly, it is the source of
                        an inflow of sense and movement to the members of the
                        body. So first, Paul shows how Christ is head because of
                        his dignity; secondly, because of the fulness of his
                        grace (v. 19); and thirdly, because of an inflow from

                        grace in the present time, and the state of glory in the
                        future. But it is the same Church, and Christ is its
                        head in both states, because he is the first in grace
                        and the first in glory. With respect to the first he
                        says, he is the beginning, the first-born from the dead,
                        because he is not only first in grace insofar as he is a
                        man, but all men are justified by faith in Christ: “By
                        one man’s obedience many will be made righteous” (Rom
                        5:19). So he says, he is the beginning [principium],
                        that is, the beginning or source of justification and
                        grace in the entire Church; because even in the Old
                        Testament some were justified by faith in Christ: “I am
                        the beginning who am speaking to you” (Jn 8:25); “With
                        you is the beginning” (Ps 110:3) [Vulgate]. Christ is
                        also the beginning of the state of glory; and so he
                        says, the first-born from the dead. The reason for this
                        is that the resurrection from the dead is a kind of
                        second birth, because it restores us to eternal life:
                        “In the rebirth, when the Son of Man sits on his
                        glorious throne” (Mt 19:28); but Christ is the first of
                        all; and thus he is the first-born from the dead, that
                        is, the first-born of those who are born by the
                        resurrection.

                        49. – But what about Lazarus (Jn 11)? 1 answer that he
                        and some others did not rise to the above mentioned
                        immortal life, but to a mortal life; but “Christ, having
                        risen from the dead, will never die again” (Rom 6:9);
                        “Jesus Christ, the first-born of the dead, and the ruler
                        of kings on earth” (Rev 1:5); “Christ has risen from the
                        dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep”
                        (1 Cor. 15:20). And this is so that in everything he
                        might be pre-eminent: pre-eminent in the gifts of grace,
                        because he is the beginning; and pre-eminent in the
                        gifts of glory, because he is the first-born: “In every
                        nation I have had first place” (Sir 24:10) [Vulgate].

                        50. – Then (v. 19), he shows the dignity of the head
                        with respect to the fulness of all graces. For some
                        saints had particular graces, but Christ had all graces;
                        and so he says, that in him all the fulness was pleased
                        to dwell [it seems that Thomas’ version lacked the words
                        “of God”]. Each word has its own force. Pleased
                        indicates that the gifts Christ had as man were not the
                        result of fate or merits, as Photinus says, but were due
                        to the good pleasure of the divine will taking this man
                        into a unity of person: “This is my beloved Son, with
                        whom I am well pleased” (Mt 3:17). He says, all, because
                        some have one gift and others different ones; but [with
                        Christ] “The Father had given all things into his hands”
                        (Jn 13:3). He says, fulness, because one can have a gift
                        without having the fulness of it or of its power,
                        because perhaps one lacks something unwillingly. But
                        John says that Christ was “full of grace and truth” (Jn
                        1:14), “My abode is in the fulness of the saints” (Sir
                        24:16). He says to dwell, because some received the use
                        of a grace for only a time; thus the spirit of prophecy
                        was not always possessed by the prophets, but it is
                        continuously present in Christ, because he always has
                        control over this fulness to use it as he wishes: “He on
                        whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he
                        who baptizes with the Holy Spirit” as we read in John
                        (1:33).

                        51. – Then when he says, and through him to reconcile to
                        himself all things, he shows that Christ is the head of
                        the Church because of an inflow from him. And this is
                        the third characteristic of a head. First, he shows the
                        inflow of grace; and secondly, he explains it.

                        only that this fulness exist in Christ, but that it also
                        flow from Christ to us; and so he says, and through him
                        to reconcile to himself all things: “God was in Christ
                        reconciling the world to himself” (2 Cor. 5:19).

                        53. – He mentions the nature of this reconciliation and
                        how all things are reconciled. Now there are two things
                        to be considered in a reconciliation. First, the matters
                        in which the reconciled persons agree. For people at
                        odds have conflicting wills, but when they have been
                        reconciled they agree in some things; and so wills that
                        were before in conflict are made to harmonize in Christ.
                        For example, the wills of men, of God and of the angels.
                        The will of men, because Christ is a man; and the will
                        of God, because Christ is God. There was also conflict
                        between the Jews, who wanted the law, and the Gentiles,
                        who did not want the law. But Christ created harmony
                        between the two, because he was from the Jews, and he
                        freed us from the legal observances. This harmony was
                        accomplished by the blood of his cross. The cause of
                        discord between God and men was sin; the discord between
                        the Jews and the Gentiles was caused by the law. Now
                        Christ destroyed sin by his cross and fulfilled the law;
                        and thus he took away the causes of discord: “You have
                        come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God,
                        the heavenly Jerusalem” (Heb 12:22). Thus we are
                        reconciled and all things are set at peace, whether on
                        earth, that is, Jews and Gentiles, or in heaven, that
                        is, the angels and God. And so when Christ was born the
                        angels sang: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
                        peace among men” (Lk 2:14). Again, Christ said at his
                        resurrection: “Peace be with you” (Jn 20:19); “For he is
                        our peace, who has made us both one” (Eph 2:14).

                        gifts he gave them. First, Paul recalls their past
                        condition; secondly, Christ’s gift (v. 22); and thirdly,
                        what they have to do now (v. 23).

                        intellect, they were ignorant; in their affections, they
                        were enemies of justice; and in their actions, they
                        committed many sins. In regard to the first he says,
                        estranged; in regard to the second, hostile in mind,
                        according to the reading of one version. This shows that
                        there was a defect in that wisdom that the Jews
                        proclaimed about the one God: “Men loved darkness rather
                        than light” (Jn 3:19). But were the Jewish people bound
                        to the law of Moses? Yes they were, so far as it
                        concerned the worship of the one God. Or, we could say
                        the Jews were estranged in mind, i.e., by choice,
                        maliciously contradicting God: “They turned aside from
                        following him” (Job 34:27). As to the third evil of
                        their past condition he says, doing evil deeds: “Their
                        deeds were evil,” as we read in John (3:19).

                        mentions the benefits coming from Christ. The first of
                        these is reconciliation in his body; and so he says, he
                        has now reconciled in his body of flesh. He says, his
                        body of flesh, not because his body and his flesh are
                        not the same, but to show that Christ took a real body:
                        “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us” (Jn
                        1:14). A body of flesh, that is, a mortal body: “God,
                        sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
                        of sin, has condemned sin in the flesh” (Rom 8:3). The
                        second benefit coming from Christ is holiness; thus he
                        says, in order to present you holy: “So Jesus also
                        suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the
                        people through his own blood” (Heb 13.12). The third
                        benefit is their cleansing from sin; and as to this he
                        says, and blameless: “The blood of Christ, who through
                        the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to
                        God, purifies your conscience from dead works” (Heb
                        9:14). Looking to the future he says, irreproachable:
                        “Be zealous to be found by him without spot or blemish
                        and at peace” (2 Pet 3:14). And he adds, before him:
                        “Man sees things that appear, but the Lord beholds the
                        heart” (1 Kg. 16:7).

                        57. – What God requires of us is that we be firm in
                        faith and hope. And so Paul continues, provided that you
                        continue in the faith, stable. For faith is a
                        foundation; if it is firm the entire structure of the
                        Church is firm. And steadfast in hope, not weakening
                        themselves from within; not shifting by allowing others
                        to shake that hope. This hope, I say, is the hope of the
                        gospel, that is, the hope that the Gospel gives for the
                        good things of the kingdom of heaven: “Repent, for the
                        kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Mt 4:17). And there is no
                        excuse, because the Gospel has been preached; and he
                        uses the past tense here instead of the future tense
                        because this future event is so certain. The Gospel has
                        been preached, by the apostles that is, to every
                        creature under heaven, that is, to every new creature,
                        that is, to the faithful, for whom it had been prepared.

                        faithfulness in it; and thirdly, its greatness (v. 25).

                        in his preaching. First, he shows his attitude toward
                        his sufferings; secondly, the fruit of his suffering (v.
                        24b). His attitude was one of joy, because Now I rejoice
                        in my sufferings for your sake, that is, for your
                        benefit: “If we are afflicted it is for your comfort and
                        salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your
                        comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure
                        the same sufferings that we suffer” (2 Cor. 1:6). He
                        also rejoices because of the joy of eternal life which
                        he expects from them, and which is the fruit of his
                        ministry: “Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet
                        various trials, for you know that the testimony of your
                        faith produces steadfastness” (Jas 1:2), “Even if I am
                        to be poured as a libation upon the sacrificial offering
                        of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all” (Phil

                        61. – And along with the above there is the fruit that
                        in my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ’s
                        afflictions. At first glance these words can be
                        misunderstood to mean that the passion of Christ was not
                        sufficient for our redemption, and that the sufferings
                        of the saints were added to complete it. But this is
                        heretical, because the blood of Christ is sufficient to
                        redeem many worlds: “He is the expiation for our sins,
                        and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole
                        world” (1 Jn 2:2). Rather, we should understand that
                        Christ and the Church are one mystical person, whose
                        head is Christ, and whose body is all the just, for
                        every just person is a member of this head:
                        “individually members” (1 Cor. 12:27). Now God in his
                        predestination has arranged how much merit will exist
                        throughout the entire Church, both in the head and in
                        the members, just as he has predestined the number of
                        the elect. And among these merits, the sufferings of the
                        holy martyrs occupy a prominent place. For while the
                        merits of Christ, the head, are infinite, each saint
                        displays some merits in a limited degree. This is why he
                        says, I complete what is lacking in Christ’s
                        afflictions, that is, what is lacking in the afflictions
                        of the whole Church, of which Christ is the head. I
                        complete, that is, I add my own amount; and I do this in
                        my flesh, that is, it is I myself who am suffering. Or,
                        we could say that Paul was completing the sufferings
                        that were lacking in his own flesh. for what was lacking
                        was that, just as Christ had suffered in his own body,
                        so he should also suffer in Paul, his member, and in
                        similar ways in others. And Paul does this for the sake
                        of his body, which is the Church that was to be redeemed
                        by Christ: “That he might present the Church to himself
                        in splendor, without spot or wrinkle” (Eph 5:27). In the
                        same way all the saints suffer for the Church, which
                        receives strength from their example. The Gloss says
                        that “afflictions are still lacking, because the
                        treasure house of the Church’s merits is not full, and
                        it will not be full until the end of the world.”

                        was given to me according to the divine office. This can
                        be explained in two ways. First in an active sense, and
                        then the meaning is that I became a minister so that I
                        could dispense divine things to you, faithfully passing
                        them on; and this power has been given to me. Secondly,
                        it can be explained in a passive sense, and then the
                        meaning is that Paul became a minister in so far as he
                        was appointed by God. “And his gifts were that some
                        should be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists,
                        some pastors and teachers” (Eph 4:11); “Set apart for me
                        Barnabas and Paul for the work to which I have called
                        them” (Acts 13:2).

                        a great purpose, that is, to make the word of God fully
                        known. First, he shows the greatness of that for which
                        he has received this ministry; secondly, he shows what
                        this is, that is, that it is Christ. He shows its
                        greatness because it has been widely proclaimed, both in
                        an obscure form and openly.

                        this mystery (it is called a mystery insofar as it is
                        hidden), because this mystery which has been hidden is
                        this word: “I have a secret, I have a secret” (Is 24:16)
                        [Vulgate]. This mystery was hidden for ages, that is,
                        from the beginning of the ages, and it was hidden from
                        all the generations of men, who were unable to know
                        this: “the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God”
                        (Eph 3:9). For even though the early philosophers seem
                        to have said something about Christ’s divinity, either
                        as being his own or appropriated (as Augustine found in
                        the works of Plato, such as that “in the beginning was
                        the Word,” and things like that), yet none could know
                        that the Word was made flesh. But you ask if this was
                        not known by the prophets? I reply that it was, insofar
                        as it pertained to the Gospel; but it was not known as

                        friend that it belongs to him, and that he can approach

                        the glory of this mystery: “All that I have heard from
                        my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose
                        me, but I chose you” (Jn 15:15); “Yea, Father, for such
                        was thy gracious will” (Mt 11:26). To make known the
                        riches of the glory of this mystery, because by the fact
                        that such things had been hidden, God now appears
                        superabundantly glorious. For God was formerly known in
                        Judea, but through this mystery of the conversion of the
                        Gentiles the glory of God is made known to the entire
                        world: as we read in John (17:4), “1 glorified thee on
                        earth.” And this is to be done among the Gentiles, that
                        is, it is to be accomplished among them: “Let us rejoice
                        in our hope of sharing the glory of God” (Rom 5:2); “O
                        the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of
                        God!” (Rom 11:33). This mystery, which is Christ, i.e.,
                        which we obtain through Christ, is the hope of glory,
                        which had formerly been promised only to the Jews: “The
                        believers from among the circumcised were amazed because
                        the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on
                        the Gentiles” (Acts 10:45); “Justified by faith, let us
                        have peace toward God; and let us glory in the hope of
                        the glory of the sons of God” (Rom 5:1-2); “The root of
                        Jesse, who stands as an ensign of the people, will be
                        called on by the Gentiles” (Is 11:10). So far Paul has
                        indicated the origin and end of his ministry.

                        brought to perfection; and so he says, that we may
                        present every man, that is, of any condition, mature,
                        not in the law, but in Christ. “You, therefore, must be
                        perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Mt 5:48).
                        But is everyone bound to perfection? No, but it should
                        be the goal of the preacher. Now the perfection of
                        charity is of two kinds. One is from a necessity of
                        precept, that is, that one not allow into his heart
                        anything opposed to God: “You shall love the Lord your
                        God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and
                        with all your mind” (Mt 22:37). The other perfection of
                        charity is from a necessity of counsel, which is that
                        one give up even those things that are lawful; and this
                        kind of perfection goes beyond what is required. But for
                        this Paul had God’s help.

                        unbelievers and sinners: “Take your share of suffering
                        as a good soldier of Christ Jesus” (2 Tim 2:3); “I have
                        fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have
                        kept the faith” (2 Tim 4.7). And Paul does this with all
                        the energy, “the grace of God is with me” (1 Cor.
                        15:10), which he inspires within me, because God does
                        this in me mightily, i.e., that is, by giving me the
                        might or power: “Stay in the city until you are clothed
                        with power from on high,” as we read in Luke (24:49).

                        Christ; here he protects them from what is opposed to
                        this state. First, from teachings that destroy it; and
                        secondly, from evil habits (ch. 3). In regard to the
                        first he does two things. First, he shows his concern
                        over their state, and secondly, he warns them against
                        evil teachings (v. 4). The first part is again divided.
                        First, he mentions his concern; secondly, the persons
                        about whom he is concerned (v. 1b); and thirdly, the
                        matter which concerns him (v. 2).

                        converted and who were with him, but also for others.
                        And so he says, for you, whom I have not seen in person,
                        but in my mind’s eye. And his concern is also for all
                        who have not seen my face. In fact, Paul cared about the
                        whole world: “For upon his long robe the whole world was
                        depicted” (Wis 18:24); “And, apart from other things,
                        there is the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for
                        all of the churches” (2 Cor. 11:28). But about whom was
                        Paul most concerned? I answer that in a certain sense he
                        was most concerned about those whom he could not see,
                        because he did not know what was happening to them. But
                        he was not concerned more about them in an absolute
                        sense.

                        secondly, he states how it can be brought about,

                        that is, that by means of me they might have spiritual
                        consolation. Such consolation is produced by what is
                        good, for when one is sad over something, it is a source
                        of joy to be consoled by something equally good. Now
                        there are two things that console us: meditation on
                        wisdom: “She [that is, wisdom] would give me
                        encouragement in cares and grief” (Wis 8:9), and prayer:
                        “Is any one of you sad? Let him pray” (Jas. 5:13).

                        he mentions their instruction in wisdom. There are two
                        versions of this passage. First, the one we have here.
                        Secondly, the one found in the Gloss: “that the hearts
                        of those instructed in love might be consoled...” so
                        that they might know “the mystery of God, the Father,
                        and of Jesus Christ.” But the meaning is the same. When
                        one is instructed in wisdom, he is consoled against
                        temporal evils. But here a person should be instructed
                        about the way; and so Paul says, in love, which is the
                        way to God: “I will show you a still more excellent way.
                        If I should speak in the tongues of men and of angels,
                        but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging
                        cymbal” (1 Cor. 13:1). Having been instructed in love,
                        that is, in the love with which God loves us, and in the
                        love with which we love him; for we are consoled by each
                        of these loves. We are consoled because God loves us:
                        “It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in
                        me... who loved me and gave himself for me” (Gal 2:20);
                        “Rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he
                        loved us, even when we were dead through our trespasses,
                        he made us alive together with Christ” (Eph 2:4). And we
                        are also consoled because we love God, for it is
                        consoling to a friend of God to endure evils for his
                        sake: “If any evil happen to me because of him, I will
                        bear it” (Sir 22:311) [Vulgate].

                        is, to the extent of their capacity. Our intellect is in
                        potency to know things, while the intellect of the angel
                        was filled at its creation with a knowledge of
                        understandable things. And so our human intellect must
                        acquire its knowledge; and it does this either by study
                        (and this is insufficient, because a thing can never be
                        known so well so that it fulfills the capacity of our
                        intellect); or it acquires its knowledge by a divine
                        revelation and as a gift from God: and this is
                        sufficient. “She [wisdom] will feed him with the bread
                        of understanding, and give him the water of wisdom to
                        drink” (Sir 15:3). And so he says, of a full
                        understanding, that is, of an understanding in
                        abundance: “What is richer than wisdom?” (Wis 8:5); “The
                        riches of salvation are wisdom and knowledge” (Is 33:6).
                        In short, they are to be instructed with such an
                        abundance of divine wisdom that it fulfills the capacity
                        of their intellect. We will have this abundance of
                        divine wisdom by knowing God; and so Paul says, so as to
                        know the mystery of God the Father and of Jesus Christ,
                        that is, to know the truth of this mystery which had
                        been hidden, which is that God is the Father of Jesus
                        Christ. Or, we could say, to know the mystery of God the
                        Father, which mystery is Christ. And so Matthew says
                        about the apostles: “Thou hast hidden these things from
                        the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes”
                        (Mt 11:25). Or, we will have this abundance of the
                        divine wisdom by our knowledge of the eternal generation
                        and of the incarnation of Christ: “To fix one’s thought
                        on her [wisdom] is perfect understanding” (Wis 6:15). As
                        Augustine says, “Happy are those who know you, and
                        unhappy those who do not.” It is by knowing God that man
                        has all fullness: “This is eternal life, that they know
                        thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast
                        sent,” as we read in John (17:4).
                      </p>

                        81. – But is our intellect filled by knowing Christ? I
                        say that it is because in him are hid all the treasures
                        of wisdom and knowledge. God has a knowledge of all
                        things, and this knowledge is called a treasure: “It is
                        an unfailing treasure for men; those who get it obtain
                        friendship with God” (Wis 7:14). Now a treasure is a
                        collection of riches; they are not called a treasure
                        when scattered about, but only when collected in one
                        place. “God has poured out his wisdom upon all his
                        works” (Sir 1:10) [Vulgate]; from this point of view his
                        wisdom does not have the nature of a treasure. But his
                        wisdom is a treasure when the ideas behind all his works
                        are considered collected together, that is, in the
                        divine wisdom. And all such treasures are in Christ.
                        Wisdom is the knowledge of divine things, and science
                        [scientia] is the knowledge of created things. Now
                        whatever can be known about God, which pertains to
                        wisdom, God knows in himself, and exhaustively. And
                        likewise, whatever can be known about created things,
                        God knows in himself, and in an super-eminent way. Now
                        whatever is in the wisdom of God is in his single Word,
                        because he knows all things by one simple act of his
                        intellect, for in God knowledge is neither in potency
                        nor in a habitual state. And thus in this Word are all
                        the treasures of wisdom and knowledge [sapientia et
                        scientia].

                        82. – He adds that these treasures are hid, because
                        there are two reasons why something might be hidden from
                        me: either because my intellect is weak, or because the
                        thing is somehow covered. Thus, a person may not see a
                        candle either because he is blind, or because the candle
                        has been covered. And so, in the Word of God there are
                        all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, but they are
                        hid from us because our eyes are not clear but bleary:
                        “A little light is in you” (Jn 12:35); and they are hid
                        because they are covered with two veils: the veil of
                        creatures, because at this time our intellect cannot
                        come to this knowledge except through the likeness of
                        creatures: “Ever since the creation of the world his
                        invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity,
                        has been clearly perceived in the things that have been
                        made” (Rom 1:20); and the veil of the flesh: “The Word
                        became flesh” (Jn 1:14). And even if we do know
                        something about God, yet we do not see all: “Truly, you
                        are a God who hides yourself” (Is 45:15); “Open your
                        treasure for him” (Num. 20:6). Let us suppose that a
                        person has a candle that is covered; he would not look
                        then for another light, but wait for the light he has to
                        become uncovered. And in the same way we do not have to
                        look for wisdom anywhere but in Christ: “For I decided
                        to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him
                        crucified” (1 Cor. 2:2). And we read in 1 John (3:2):
                        “When he appears,” that is, is revealed, “we shall be
                        like him,” that is, knowing all things. In other words,
                        if I had a book in which all knowledge was contained, I
                        would seek to know only that book; similarly, it is not
                        necessary for us to seek any further than Christ.

                        destructive doctrines. For they were being misled by
                        certain philosophers in matters against the faith, and
                        by heretics who taught that the ceremonies of the law
                        had to be observed. First, he teaches them in opposition
                        to the philosophers; and secondly, in opposition to the
                        Judaizers (v. 11). In worldly knowledge there are two
                        things: a knowledge of the spoken language, and a
                        knowledge of things themselves. And so they could be
                        deceived in two ways. Thus he first warns them against
                        those philosophers who were deceiving them by their
                        ability to speak well; and secondly, against those who
                        were misleading them about the knowledge of things, when
                        he says, “See to it that no one makes a prey of you by
                        philosophy and empty deceit” (2:8). First, he mentions
                        this deception; and secondly, the reason for it (v. 5).

                        effect, that although I have not preached to you, nor do

                        (2 Tim 2:19). And this in Christ: “That Christ may dwell
                        in your hearts through faith, rooted and founded in
                        love” (Eph 3:17); “In whom the whole structure is joined
                        together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord” (Eph
                        2:21). The goodness of this temple consists in its firm
                        foundation, which is faith, and in a proper
                        superstructure; and that is why he mentioned these two.

                        first, by advancing in them; secondly, by their
                        perseverance; and thirdly, by giving thanks. So he says,
                        As therefore you received Christ Jesus, not in a
                        distorted way, so live in him. “Hold fast to what is
                        good,” as we read in Romans (12:9). Sometimes the Church
                        is compared to a spiritual building: “God’s temple is
                        holy, and that temple you are” (1 Cor. 3:17). At other
                        times it is compared to a tree, because it produces
                        fruit. Now the foundation of a building is related to
                        the building as the roots of a tree are related to the
                        tree, because the foundation and roots are the source of
                        strength; and this source is Christ. “In that day the
                        root of Jesse shall stand as an ensign to the peoples”
                        (Is. 11:10); “For no other foundation can any one lay
                        than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ” (1 Cor.
                        3:11). So Paul uses the expression, rooted, like good
                        branches, and built up in him and established, like good
                        stones. And they will be like this if they persevere in
                        the faith. “Your adversary, the devil, prowls around
                        like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour” (1 Pet.
                        5:8); and the text continues: “Resist him, firm in your
                        faith.” They are to live in Christ just as you were
                        taught, that is, in the true faith: “If any one is
                        preaching to you a gospel contrary to that which you
                        received, let him be accursed” (Gal 1:9). Abounding in
                        thanksgiving, giving may thanks: as we read in 1
                        Thessalonians (5:18), “Giving thanks in all
                        circumstances”; “Having been saved by God out of grave
                        dangers, we give him great thanks” (2 Macc 1:11).

                        an empty wisdom. First, we see his warning; and
                        secondly, the reason for it (v. 9). In regard to the
                        first, he first teaches them to avoid whatever can
                        deceive them; and secondly, the source of this deception

                        91. – A person can be deceived by worldly wisdom in two
                        ways, that is, sometimes by the real principles of
                        philosophy, and sometimes by fallacious arguments. And
                        Paul teaches them to beware of both: See to it that no
                        one makes a prey of you by philosophy, that is, by
                        philosophical teachings: “Your wisdom and your knowledge
                        led you astray” (Is 47:10). For there are many who have
                        turned from the faith after having been deceived by
                        philosophy: “Man has become foolish in his knowledge”
                        (Jer. 10:14). As regards to the second way to be
                        deceived he says, and empty deceit, which is based on
                        the way words are used: “Let no one deceive you with
                        empty words,” as is said in Ephesians (5:6).
                      </p>

                        92. – But how are they being deceived? One who deceives
                        another must have something which seems reasonable, and
                        something which is not really so. So first Paul shows
                        the basis of this seeming reasonableness. It is based on
                        two things, the first being the authority of the
                        philosophers. And about this he says, according to human
                        tradition, that is, according to what is handed down by
                        some, basing themselves on their own judgment: “The Lord
                        knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath”
                        (Ps 94:11). The second source of an apparent
                        reasonableness are the contrivances of reason, that is,
                        when a person wishes to measure or judge about the
                        things of faith according to the principles of things,
                        and not by divine wisdom. And many are deceived in this
                        way. And so Paul says, they should not be deceived by
                        those judging according to the elements of the universe,
                        and not according to Christ: “They were unable from the
                        good things that are seen to know him who exists” (Wis
                        13:1). Now the higher a cause is, the more superior is
                        its effect. And so those who wish to investigate certain
                        effects in terms of causes that are inferior are
                        deceived. For example, if one were to consider the
                        movement of water in terms of the power of water, he
                        would not be able to know the cause of the tides of the
                        sea; to do this he would have to consider water in terms
                        of the power of the moon. Thus, those people are even
                        more deceived who consider the proper effects of God in
                        terms of the elements of the world. And this is the
                        reason for the seeming plausibility of what they say.

                        [93. –] 94. – Or, we could say that according to the
                        elements of the universe means, by measuring the truth
                        of faith according to the truth of creatures. Or perhaps
                        Paul said this referring to the idolaters who were
                        worshiping idols and saying that Jupiter was the
                        heavens. Or, Paul was referring to the Jewish people,
                        and then the text is understood this way: by philosophy,
                        by the reasoning of those who were trying to convince
                        them to observe the ceremonies of the law, and these,
                        according to the elements of the universe or world, that
                        is, according to the bodily observances: “We were slaves
                        to the elements of the world” (Gal 4:3). But our first
                        explanation is better.

                        deity dwells bodily, he gives the reason for what he has
                        just stated, saying that whatever is not according to
                        Christ should be rejected. But is Christ so good that
                        all things should be rejected for him? He answers that
                        he is, and shows it in three ways: first, by considering
                        his divinity; secondly, by his relationship to those who
                        believe (v. 10a); and thirdly, by his relationship to
                        the angels (v. 10b).

                        96. – So he says: Whatever is contrary to Christ must be
                        rejected, because he is God. Thus we must prefer him to
                        everything else, for in him the whole fulness of deity
                        dwells bodily. Now God is in all things. He is in some
                        things because they participate in a likeness to his
                        goodness, as a stone and things like that. Such things
                        are not God, but they have in themselves something of
                        God; not his substance, but a likeness of his goodness.
                        Consequently, the fulness of divinity does not dwell in
                        them, because he is not there according to his
                        substance. Again, he is in holy minds by an activity,
                        minds which attain God by love and knowledge; and thus
                        God is in them by grace, not bodily, but according to
                        the effect of grace. And he is not there in his fulness,
                        but only by some limited effects. But God is present in
                        Christ bodily; and this is explained in three ways.

                        97. – A body is distinguished from its shadow: “These
                        are only a shadow of what is to come; but the substance
                        belongs to Christ” (Heb 2:17). And so God can indwell in
                        two ways, either as a shadow or bodily, that is, really.
                        The first way is the way he dwelt in the Old Law, but in
                        Christ he dwells bodily, that is, really and truly. This
                        passage is explained in a second way by saying that God
                        dwells in the other saints only with respect to their
                        souls, and not in their bodies: “For I know that nothing
                        good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh” (Rom 7:18).
                        But the divinity dwells in Christ bodily, because the
                        indwelling of God in the saints is by an activity, that
                        is, by love and knowledge, which are actions of a
                        rational mind alone, but God dwells in Christ by
                        assuming a man into the unity of his person. And thus
                        whatever relates to this man is indwelt by God; and thus
                        his flesh and mind are indwelt because both are united
                        to the Word: “And the Word became flesh” (Jn 1:14). The
                        third explanation of this passage is as follows: God is
                        in things in three ways. One way is common, that is, by
                        his power, presence and essence. He is present in
                        another way in the saints, that is, by grace. The third
                        way is found only in Christ, and he is present here by
                        union. Now a body has three dimensions, and the fulness
                        of the divinity superabounds in Christ in these ways.
                        And so the deity is said to be in him bodily. The
                        fulness of the divinity is in Christ, as it were, by
                        length, because it extends to all things; it is in him
                        by breadth, that is, in its charity, and it is in him in
                        its depth, that is, in its incomprehensibility.

                        98. – Nestorius was mistaken on this point: he said that
                        this union was brought about entirely by an indwelling,
                        the Word dwelling in the flesh. But the Apostle does not
                        agree with this, for he says in Philippians (2:7): “He
                        emptied himself, taking the form of a servant” Now when
                        one dwells in a man he does not empty himself; one
                        empties oneself by becoming man. And so Paul continues,
                        “being born in the likeness of man.” And so Christ is
                        indwelt, but not in the sense that the one indwelling
                        and the one dwelt in are distinct, but in the sense that
                        Christ is both man and God, in whom dwells the fulness
                        of the deity.

                        him, he shows the same thing by relating Christ to
                        others. He is saying, in effect: You have received all
                        things: “From his fulness have we all received” (Jn
                        1:16). We should note that the Platonists teach that all
                        divine gifts come to men by the mediation of the
                        separated substances; and this is true even according to
                        Dionysius. But this is something special, that we
                        receive divine gifts immediately from him who is the
                        fulness of the angels: “The only Son who is in the bosom
                        of the Father, he has made him known” (Jn 1:18); “It was
                        declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us
                        by those who heard him” (Heb 2:3).

                        is the head of man. And Paul mentions those orders [of
                        angels] which seem to have a certain preeminence.

                        the circumcision of Christ; 12 and you were buried with

                        the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive
                        together with him, having forgiven us all our

                        against us with its legal demands; this he set aside,
                        nailing it to the cross. 15 He disarmed the
                        principalities and powers and made a public example of
                        them, triumphing over them in him.

                        instructs and warns them against those heretics who
                        wanted to drag them into the observances of the law.
                        First, he instructs them to avoid such persons;
                        secondly, he rejects the false enticements they used (v.
                        18). In regard to the first, he does two things: first,
                        he shows that the observances of the law were completed
                        in Christ; and secondly, he rejects these observances,
                        showing that they are not bound to follow them (v. 16).

                        102. – Among the observances of the law, the first was
                        circumcision. By this, the Jews professed their
                        observance of the Old Law, just as we profess our
                        observance of the New Law by baptism: “I testify again
                        to every man who receives circumcision that he is bound
                        to keep the whole law” (Gal 5:3). So Paul says that the
                        faithful have been circumcised with a certain spiritual
                        circumcision, from which it follows that the other has
                        ceased. First, he shows what kind of circumcision they
                        have received; and secondly, how it was received.
                        Finally, he tells why they were circumcised in this way
                        (v. 13).

                        are two kinds of circumcision, bodily and spiritual. We
                        have been circumcised by Christ with a spiritual
                        circumcision, and not by the bodily kind. So first Paul
                        eliminates such a bodily circumcision, and then explains
                        about this spiritual circumcision. Paul continues: In
                        him, that is, in Christ, you were circumcised with a
                        circumcision made without hands: “For he is not a real
                        Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision
                        something external and physical. He is a Jew who is one
                        inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter of the
                        heart, spiritual and not literal” (Rom 2:28).

                        understood in two ways. In the first way Paul says that
                        you were circumcised with a circumcision made without
                        hands, by putting off the body of flesh, that is, by
                        putting off the corruption of the flesh, as mentioned in
                        1 Corinthians (15:50): “Flesh and blood cannot inherit
                        the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the
                        imperishable.” He is saying in effect: You have been
                        circumcised because you no longer have the vices of the
                        flesh: “You have put off the old nature with its
                        practices” (Col 3:9). Another explanation would be: You
                        have been circumcised with a circumcision made not with
                        hands, which circumcision made with hands consists in a
                        putting off the body of flesh which is cut from it. And
                        so in another version of this passage we find “skin of
                        the flesh,” instead of “body of flesh,” that is, putting
                        off a small part of the body which is flesh. (The
                        meaning is not that the body is one thing and the flesh
                        another). Paul uses the word “flesh” to refer us back to
                        the law, where it speaks of flesh: “You shall be
                        circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins” (Gen 17:11).
                        He uses this word also to show that it is a carnal
                        observance.

                        way, but with the circumcision of Christ. For just as
                        Christ accepted a likeness to sinful flesh, that is,
                        flesh that could suffer, in order to free us from sin,
                        so he also accepted the remedies contained in the law,
                        so that he could free us from the observances of the
                        law. Or, we could interpret the circumcision of Christ
                        to mean the circumcision which Christ accomplishes in
                        us, which is a spiritual circumcision, as Romans (2:29)
                        says: “spiritual and not literal.”

                        circumcision in baptism, and so baptism is a spiritual
                        circumcision. And first, he shows that in baptism we
                        have a symbol of Christ’s death, secondly, that in
                        baptism we receive a likeness to his resurrection (v.

                        Christ’s death, and it is this: just as Christ was put
                        into the tomb, after having been put on the cross, so a
                        person who is baptized is put under the water, and this
                        is done three times, just as Christ was three days in
                        the tomb. Again, you were buried with him in baptism,
                        that is, your baptism was like the death of Christ, for
                        as his death destroyed sin, so also does your baptism.

                        the flesh in hope. This is accomplished through faith in
                        the working of God, because it was by the power of God
                        that Christ was raised: “Raise me up, that I may requite

                        8:11). But Christ also raised himself, because the
                        action of the Father and of the Son is the same: “I will
                        awake the dawn” (Ps 108:2).

                        been circumcised, because you have been buried, in
                        baptism, with Christ. And he compared baptism to the
                        burial and death of Christ. Yet one could say that it
                        would be more to the point to say that Paul first shows
                        that baptism is a circumcision. And secondly, he shows
                        why it is a circumcision, that is, because sin is
                        superfluous and the foreskin is superfluous. And so to
                        remove sin and to remove the foreskin are the same. Now
                        sin is removed in baptism. Therefore, baptism is the
                        same as a circumcision. And so Paul says, and you, who
                        were dead in trespasses, that is, because of your sins:
                        “The death of sinners is the worst” (Ps 34:21), and in
                        the uncircumcision of your flesh, that is, in your
                        carnal concupiscence, which is related to original sin,
                        as though they were chained with a debt of evil actions
                        and of mortal sin.

                        sin from you, forgiving and remitting all your faults.
                        Thus, to be circumcised is the same as to be made alive,
                        for the same baptism removes the death of sin and
                        circumcises us by cutting off original sin.

                        to the devil-, and secondly, he mentions the removing of

                        against us. This bond or written decree can be
                        understood in two ways. In one way it is the Old Law:
                        “By abolishing in his flesh the law of commandments and
                        ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man
                        in place of the two” (Eph 2:15). This is its meaning
                        when he is here speaking in reference to the Jews, as if
                        to say: and you... God made alive. Again, a written bond
                        is a warranty usually employed in contracts. And whoever
                        violates God’s bond is subject to a debt of punishment.
                        This violation is retained in the person’s memory, which
                        it disturbs and stains; it is retained in God’s memory,
                        who is to judge such matters; and in the memory of the
                        devils, who will torment them. Now the memory of this
                        violation is called a bond. And it is Christ who has
                        forgiven all by having canceled the bond, that is, the
                        memory of the transgression, which stood against us. The
                        bond, in both its meanings, was against us: the Law,
                        because it gave mankind a knowledge of sin, but did not
                        help [in overcoming sin], and the memory of our
                        transgressions, for which we deserved to be punished.
                        The term bond is used because its violation is not
                        forgiven in such a way as to bring it about that there
                        was never any sin. Rather, such sin is not remembered by
                        God as something to be punished; it is not remembered by
                        the devils as something to accuse us of; and we do not
                        remember our sins as reasons for sorrow: “Blessed is he
                        whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered”
                        (Ps 32:1).

                        that Paul is here speaking in general, to all, not just
                        about the Jews. And then we can say that a command was
                        given to the first man: “You may freely eat of every
                        tree of the garden; but of the tree of knowledge of good
                        and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat
                        of it you shall die” (Gen 2:16). But man violated this
                        law, and the memory of this violation became a bond
                        which stood against us. And Christ canceled this.

                        115. – How did Christ cancel this bond? On the cross,
                        for this he set aside, nailing it to the cross. It was
                        the custom for a bond to be torn up once a person had
                        fulfilled all his obligations. Now man was in sin and
                        Christ paid for this by his suffering: “What I did not
                        steal must I now restore?” (Ps 69:4). And therefore, at
                        the moment of Christ’s death this bond was canceled and
                        destroyed. And so he says, this he set aside, nailing it
                        to the cross, by which he took away our sin by making
                        satisfaction to God.

                        116. – Then (v. 15), he shows how Christ freed us from
                        the slavery of sin. For if a creditor holds a man
                        captive on account of a debt that he owes, it is not
                        enough merely to pay the debt; the person himself must
                        also be freed. This is what Christ did. So Paul says, he
                        disarmed [rather, “despoiled”] the principalities and
                        powers. This despoiling can refer to those saints who
                        had died before Christ’s passion; in this sense, Christ
                        freed them from the lower world by despoiling the devil:
                        “As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant
                        with you, I will set your captives free from the
                        waterless pit” (Zech 9:11); “Even the captives of the
                        mighty shall be taken, and the prey of the tyrant be
                        rescued” (Is 49:25). But if we understand this as
                        referring to the living, then he despoiled them from the
                        devils: “But when one stronger than he assails him and
                        overcomes him, he takes away his armor in which he
                        trusted, and divides his spoil” (Lk 11:22); “Now shall
                        the ruler of this world be cast out” (Jn 12:31). Thus he
                        says, he despoiled the principalities and powers, that
                        is, the devils themselves: “Against the principalities,
                        against the powers, against the world rulers of this
                        present darkness, against the spiritual hosts of
                        wickedness in heavenly places” (Eph 6:12). And made a
                        public example of them, that is, the saints, as one who
                        had authority in heaven, over the dead and the living,
                        in the kingdom of his glory or of his grace. Or we could
                        say he made a public example of them, that is, he drove
                        out the principalities from mankind, “Awake, and put on
                        strength, O arm of the Lord” (Is 51:9), and with a
                        public judgment, so it could be known that they were
                        expelled. For at one time the world did serve idols, but
                        not now. Or we could say there was a public example,
                        that is, before the multitude of angels, because Christ
                        descended into the lower world of the saints and
                        ascended into heaven. Triumphing over them in him, that
                        is, in himself, in his own power. “By the power which
                        enables him even to subject all things to himself” (Phil
                        3:21).

                        powers, triumphing confidently.” “He put off his flesh,”
                        that is, his mortality. “Flesh and blood,” that is, the
                        mortality of bodily corruption, “cannot inherit the
                        kingdom of God” (1 Cor. 15:50); “Christ being raised
                        from the dead will never die again; death no longer has
                        dominion over him” (Rom 6:9), “Even though we once
                        regarded Christ from a human point of view, we regard
                        him thus no longer” (2 Cor. 5:16). “He exemplified,” he
                        gave us an example of how the principalities and powers
                        are to be overcome. The meaning of the rest stays the

                        belonged to the world? Why do you submit to regulations,
                        21 “Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch” 22
                        (referring to things which all perish as they are used),
                        according to human precepts and doctrines? 23 These have
                        indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting rigor of
                        devotion and self-abasement and severity to the body,
                        but they are of no value, serving only to indulge the
                        flesh.

                        Christ because of the circumcision he received, for this
                        is an acknowledgment of the law. Here, he concludes that
                        they are not obliged to observe the ceremonial commands
                        of the law. There were four kinds of ceremonial matters:
                        sacrifices, sacred things, sacraments, and observances.
                        The sacrifices were those things which were immolated to
                        God, such as sheep, oxen and the like. The sacred things
                        included utensils and religious festivals. There were
                        three sacraments: circumcision, the paschal lamb, and
                        the consecration of priests. The observances were those
                        matters that were related to the unique customs in the
                        life of the people of Israel, things such as food,
                        clothing and the like. Some of the above matters, such
                        as the sacrifices, the utensils and so on, pertained
                        only to some of the people; other matters were connected
                        to all the people. Paul does not mention those things
                        which pertained just to some, but only those which
                        affected all, just as baptism now affects us all.

                        abstained from certain foods, such as four-legged
                        animals that do not have a divided hoof (Lev 11:26). In
                        regard to drink, a vessel without a cover was unclean,
                        as was anything in it. And so with respect to these
                        matters he says, let no one pass judgment on you in
                        questions of food and drink, that is, let no one condemn
                        you for taking food and drink forbidden in the law: “Let
                        not him who abstains pass judgment on him who eats; for
                        God has welcomed him” (Rom 14:3).

                        120. – He also mentions sacred matters related to the
                        religious festivals and ceremonies. Under the Old Law
                        there were continuous religious ceremonies, like the
                        morning and evening sacrifices. There were other
                        ceremonies held at certain definite times. Some of these
                        were held several times during the year, as the sabbath
                        every week, and the now moon every month. Others came
                        only once a year, as the Passover, the Feast of
                        Tabernacles and Pentecost. The reason for all this is
                        that all religious ceremonies are held for the honor of
                        God. Now we give honor to God either because of
                        something which is eternal, and thus we have continuous
                        religious ceremonies; or we honor him because of certain
                        temporal benefits which affect all people. There are two
                        such benefits. First, the gift of creation; and thus we
                        have the religious ceremony of the sabbath: “Remember
                        the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Ex 20:8). The reason
                        for keeping the sabbath is that God rested on the
                        seventh day. The allegorical reason for the sabbath is
                        that it signifies Christ’s rest in the tomb, and the
                        anagogical reason would be that it signifies the soul’s
                        rest in God. The other gift is that of procreation and
                        preservation, which are also for a time. And since the
                        Jewish people calculated the time by the moon, he says,
                        a new moon. There are also other reasons for honoring
                        God, as a special rescue or deliverance; and so other
                        festivals were added to the above. And so he says, or
                        with regard to a festival or a new moon, every month, or
                        sabbath[s], every seventh period. He says sabbath[s]
                        because a sabbath is a rest, and they had several
                        sabbaths: the seventh day; and seven weeks, that is
                        Pentecost, which is the end of the seventh week
                        following the Passover, which is the beginning of the
                        year; and the seventh month; and the seventh year, when
                        sins are forgiven; and after seven periods of seven
                        years there was a Jubilee. With this in mind Paul says,
                        or sabbath[s], meaning: Let no one condemn you for not
                        observing these feasts.

                        that is, of Christ. And when the truth comes, the shadow
                        should cease, but the substance belongs to Christ. When
                        someone sees a shadow, he expects the body or
                        substantial reality to follow. Now the legal observances
                        of the law were the shadow going before Christ, and they
                        signified his coming; and so Paul says, the substance,
                        that is, the truth of the thing, belongs to Christ, but
                        the shadow belongs to the law.

                        their “humility,” bringing in observances taken from the
                        law, for they pretended to be holy. But holiness
                        consists of two things: a humble manner of life, and the
                        worship of God. Now these people appeared to lead a
                        humble life since they seemed to have no care for the
                        things of the world; and so Paul says they were
                        insisting on self-abasement. “There is one who is humble
                        in an evil way, and within he is full of deceit” (Sir.
                        19:23). Again, they claimed to be preaching out of
                        reverence for God; and so Paul says, and [religion] of
                        angels: for religion, according to Cicero, consists in
                        ceremonies and worship for a divine nature: “Holding the
                        form of religion but denying the power of it” (2 Tim
                        3:5).

                        religion of angels,” for in this way these seducers
                        wanted to seem like angels, that is, as messengers, of
                        God: “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in
                        sheep’s clothing yet inwardly are ravenous wolves” (Mt
                        7:15). Or, “in the religions of angels,” can be
                        understood in a literal sense, because the Old Law was
                        made known by angels, as we see from Galatians (3:19);
                        “For if the message declared by angels was valid and
                        every transgression or disobedience received a just
                        retribution, how shall we escape if we neglect such a
                        great salvation?” (Heb 2:2). These people maintained
                        that the worship mandated in the law had to be kept,
                        because it had been given through angels.

                        they were defective in their knowledge, in their
                        justice, and in their faith. As to their knowledge, Paul
                        says that such a person was taking his stand on [things
                        that were not seen], that is, things that were not
                        understood. Such a one did not know why the law was
                        given: “Desiring to be teachers of the law, without
                        understanding either what they are saying or the things
                        about which they make assertions” (1 Tim 1:7).

                        were puffed up without reason, in vain, although they
                        pretended to be humble. And he mentions two things.
                        First, that their religion was useless, because they
                        went about without reason, in vain, that is, doing
                        things that were of no value for eternal life: “Their
                        labors are unprofitable” (Wis 3:11); “Though her labor
                        be in vain, yet she has no fear restraining her” (Job
                        39:16). They also showed a false humility, and so he
                        says that such a one was puffed up by his sensuous mind.
                        There is a difference between one who is puffed up and
                        one who is robust. A person who is robust is full with
                        truth, while one who is puffed up is empty, and just
                        extended with wind. Therefore, those who are truly
                        humble are full, but those who are only puffed up are
                        empty. “He will burst those who are puffed up” (Wis
                        4:19) [Vulgate]. This is the meaning of 1 Corinthians
                        (8:1): “Knowledge puffs up.”

                        Such people are deceived, because without Christ they
                        are in the dark: “If any one does not agree with the
                        sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching
                        which accords with godliness, he is puffed up with

                        129. – Why is Christ the Head? Paul answers: because the
                        entire good of the body, which is the Church, depends on
                        him. For there are two goods in a natural body: the
                        union or joining together of its members and its growth.
                        And the Church obtains these from Christ, for the entire
                        body depends on him: “We, though many, are one body in
                        Christ” (Rom 12:5). In a body the members are joined in
                        two ways. One way is by contact, as the hand is joined
                        to the wrist, and the wrist to the forearm, and so on.
                        The other way is by a connection, as being joined by
                        nerves. And so Paul refers to joints and ligaments. So
                        also in the Church, its members are joined by faith and
                        understanding: “One Lord, one faith, one baptism” (Eph
                        4:5). But this is incomplete without the ligaments of
                        charity and the sacraments. Thus Paul says, nourished
                        through ligaments, because it is through charity that
                        one person supplies another. This body is developed by
                        Christ, because it grows with a growth that is from God,
                        that is, with a growth that God produces in us: “Blessed
                        are the men whose strength is in thee,... they go from
                        strength to strength” (Ps 84:5). Or, from God, that is,
                        from Christ, who, as God, increases the body, the Church
                        being enlarged: “For the equipment of the saints, for
                        the work of the ministry, for building up the body of
                        Christ” (Eph 4:12).

                        therefore, If with Christ you died, being dead to the
                        law, to the [elements], that is, to the observances of
                        the law (for the Jewish people served the true God, but
                        under the elements; while the Gentiles served the
                        elements themselves), why, since you know the truth, do
                        you live as if you still belonged to the world, like the
                        Jews live? Why do you submit to regulations about what
                        is to be handled and eaten; regulations such as do not
                        handle, because it is a sin; do not taste pork or eels
                        (Lev 11:7, 11)?

                        observances, saying that they are harmful, vain, and
                        burdensome; thus Paul says, which all perish as they are
                        used, because after the passion of Christ they were
                        deadly to all those who placed their hope in them; but
                        after grace had been spread among the people, such
                        things were deadly to all, absolutely. (I am saying this
                        because it is the opinion of Jerome and Augustine which
                        I mentioned in commenting on the second chapter of
                        Galatians). And so they lead to destruction and death.
                        Why, then, do we still read the Old Testament? I answer
                        that we read it as a witness, but not as something to be
                        observed. Thus Paul says, which all perish as they are
                        used, that is, if they are not regarded merely as a
                        witness, but are observed.

                        authority are vain. But these things are not founded on
                        divine authority, but on human authority. Thus Paul
                        says, according to human precepts. But these precepts
                        were from God, were they not? I say that they were, but
                        were to be only for a time, until the truth should come:
                        “For the sake of your tradition you have made void the
                        word of God” (Mt 15:6). Furthermore, they are not
                        founded on reason, because they have indeed an
                        appearance of wisdom [in superstition], meaning, they
                        are based on reasons that lead to superstition, that is,
                        to a religion that is extreme and past its time. And
                        their reasons lead to self-abasement, which is not
                        genuine, because a person who has been freed from the
                        slavery of the law by Christ, should not submit himself
                        to this slavery again: “Do not submit again to a yoke of
                        slavery” (Gal 5:1). Sometimes precepts that do not rest
                        on divine authority are observed because they are useful
                        for some human purpose.

                        134. – But this is not the case here, for these precepts
                        considered in themselves are a burden. We desire three
                        things: rest, honor and a fulness; and these are not
                        produced by these legal observances. For the ban on
                        foods is opposed to fulness, and becomes a burden
                        because so many rules are involved. Further, these
                        observances do not produce honor, but bring much
                        confusion, as when ashes are sprinkled about, and the
                        like: “A yoke upon the disciples which neither our
                        fathers nor we have been able to bear” (Ac 15:10). Such
                        practices lead to a severity to the body, that is, the
                        Church, and not to the honor of God; rather they serve
                        only to indulge the flesh, i.e., to satisfy carnal
                        desire.

                        things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the
                        right hand of God. 2 Set your minds on things that are
                        above, not on things that are on earth. 3 For you have
                        died, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 4 When
                        Christ who is our life appears, then you also will
                        appear with him in glory. 5 Put to death therefore what
                        is earthly in you: immorality, impurity, passion, evil
                        desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. 6 On
                        account of these the wrath of God is coming [upon the
                        children of despair]. 7 In these you once walked, when
                        you lived in them.

                        those who wished to deceive them; here he teaches them
                        to avoid evil habits. First, he gives his teaching in a
                        general way; secondly, he presents it in more detail (v.
                        18). In regard to the first he does two things. First,
                        he teaches them to have a right intention in regard to
                        their end, and in the second place, he instructs them
                        about the rectitude of their human actions (v. 5). The
                        first is divided into two parts. First, he gives the
                        main idea of his teaching, seek the things that are
                        above; and secondly, he gives the reason why they should
                        do so, for you have died. In regard to the first he does
                        two things. First, he mentions the benefit they have
                        received; secondly, he draws his conclusion, set your
                        minds on things that are above.

                        the resurrection of Christ, we also have risen. And we
                        have risen in two ways. First, by a hope for our bodily
                        resurrection: “Now if Christ is preached as raised from
                        the dead, how can some of you say that there is no
                        resurrection of the dead?” (1 Cor. 15:12). In the second
                        way, with the resurrection of Christ we are restored to
                        the life of justice: “He was put to death for our
                        trespasses and raised for our justification” (Rom 4:25).
                        Paul is saying in effect: When Christ arose, you also
                        arose: “He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also
                        with Jesus,” as we read in 2 Corinthians (4:14).

                        are above, he draws his conclusion about the end: first,
                        that a person should aim at some principal end; and
                        secondly, that he should judge other things in the light
                        of that end.

                        138. – Paul says, therefore, If then you have been
                        raised with Christ, seek the things that are above:
                        “Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all
                        these things shall be yours as well” (Mt 6:33). For this
                        is our end: “One thing have I asked of the Lord, that
                        will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the
                        Lord all the days of my life” (Ps 27:4). Therefore, seek
                        this, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God:
                        “So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them,
                        was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand
                        of God” (Mk 16:19); “Sit at my right hand” (Ps 110:1).
                        By “the right hand of God” he does not mean a member of
                        a body, but he is speaking figuratively, for the right
                        hand of a person is the stronger. Christ sits at the
                        right hand of the Father because, as man, he shares in
                        the stronger and better goods of the Father, while as
                        God, Christ is equal to the Father. Consequently, you
                        should have this intention: that just as Christ died and
                        arose, and was taken up to sit at the right hand of God,
                        so you should die to sin in order to live a life of
                        justice and so be taken up into glory. Or, we could say,
                        that we arose through Christ; but he is seated at the
                        right hand of God, and so our desire should be to be
                        with him: “Wherever the body is, there the eagles will
                        be gathered together” (Mt 24:28); “Where your treasure
                        is, there will your heart be also” (Mt 6:21).

                        the light of Christ; and so Paul says, set your mind on
                        things that are above, not on things that are on earth.
                        Here he is affirming one way of life, and rejecting
                        another. A person sets his mind on things that are
                        above, when he governs his life according to heavenly
                        ideas, and judges all things by such ideas: “The wisdom
                        from above” (Jas. 3:17). And a person sets his mind on
                        things that are on earth when he orders and judges all
                        things according to earthly goods, considering them the
                        highest goods: “They glory in their shame, with minds
                        set on earthly things” (Phil 3:19).

                        death; secondly, their hidden life (v. 3b); and thirdly,
                        he teaches when this life will be revealed (v. 4).

                        141. – Just before, Paul had rejected one way of life
                        and affirmed another. Now he returns to these two ways.
                        As to the first he says: Do not set your minds on
                        earthly things, because you have died to an earthly way
                        of life. And a person who has died to this kind of life
                        does not set his mind on the things of this world. This
                        is the way you should act if you have died, with Christ,
                        to the elements of this world: “So you also must
                        consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in
                        Christ Jesus” (Rom 6:11); “They are dead, they will not
                        live” (Is 26:14). When he said [above, in Romans],
                        “consider yourselves dead,” he followed this with, “and
                        alive”.

                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        142. – And so there is another life which is hidden. And
                        thus Paul also says here, and your life is hid with
                        Christ in God. We acquire this life through Christ. “For
                        Christ also died for sins once for all, the righteous
                        for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God” (1
                        Pet. 3:18). But because this life is obtained through
                        Christ, and Christ is hidden from us because he is in
                        the glory of the Father, this life which is given to us
                        through him is also hidden, namely, where Christ is, in
                        the glory of the Father: “Long life is in his right
                        hand; in his left hand are riches and honor” (Prov
                        3:16); “O how abundant is your goodness, which you have
                        laid up for those who fear you” (Ps 31:19); “To him who
                        conquers I will give some of the hidden manna” (Rev
                        2:17).

                        shows how this life will be manifested, that is, just as
                        Christ’s; for we read, “Our God comes” (Ps 50:3). And so
                        Paul says, when Christ who is our life appears, because
                        he is the Author of our life, and because our life
                        consists in knowing and loving him: “It is no longer I
                        who live, but Christ who lives in me” (Gal 2:20). When
                        Christ appears then you also will appear: “When he
                        appears we shall be like him” (1 Jn 3:2), that is, in
                        glory: “God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount
                        Paran” (Hab 3:3).

                        144. – Next (v. 5), Paul puts order into their actions:
                        first, by restraining them from sin; secondly, by
                        teaching them about good habits (v. 12). In regard to
                        the first he does two things: first, he starts with a
                        warning; secondly, he explains it (v. 9b). The first is
                        divided into two parts: first, he forbids carnal vices;
                        secondly, he gives his reason (v. 6). With respect to
                        the first he does two things: first, he lays down a
                        general prohibition; secondly, he goes into detail about
                        it (v. 5).
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        145. – He says, put to death therefore [your members
                        that are on earth]: You ought not to set your minds on
                        things that are on earth, but put to death whatever is
                        earthly, and in particular, your members that are on
                        earth. We can explain this by making a comparison: our
                        life involves many actions, just as our body contains
                        many members. In a good life, prudence is like the eye,
                        which directs a person; and courage is like the feet,
                        which support and carry him. But in an evil life,
                        craftiness becomes the eye, and obstinacy becomes the
                        feet. Therefore, these members must be put to death. Or
                        we could say that in reference to the members of the
                        body, he had said, “you have died” (v. 3), that is, to
                        an earthly way of life. But how is this death
                        accomplished? He answers: put to death your members.
                        Thus, to the extent we have died to sin, to that extent
                        we are alive with grace. For the life of grace heals us
                        with respect to our mind; but not entirely as to our
                        body, because it retains a tendency to sin: “I of myself
                        serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I
                        serve the law of sin” (Rom 7:25); and he said, a little
                        before this: “I see in my members another law at war
                        with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law
                        of sin which dwells in my members” (v. 23). Therefore,
                        because you have died so far as concerns your mind, put
                        to death the sinful desires in your members that are on
                        earth, insofar as they are on earth and are earthly
                        bodies: “I pommel my body and subdue it” (1 Cor. 9:27),
                        by not allowing it to be drawn to carnal things.
                      </p>

                        146. – Now he mentions particular sins: first, those
                        that are purely carnal; secondly, those that are partly
                        carnal. Among the carnal sins, we are inclined to lust
                        especially by concupiscence. Lustful actions are
                        shameful and although they may accord with the nature of
                        man as animal, they are not fitting to it as rational,
                        because every sin is opposed to reason. And so Paul
                        says, immorality: “Beware, my son, of all immorality”
                        (Job 4:12). Or, a sin can be against nature, and so he
                        says, impurity. Again, pleasure might be impure, and so
                        he says, passion; and desire can be depraved, and so he
                        says, evil desire. Secondly, he lists the intermediate
                        sins. The first of these is covetousness, whose object
                        is something corporeal, that is, money, but it is
                        completed in a spiritual delight, that is, in the
                        ownership of such. And thus it has some part among the
                        carnal sins. Paul adds, which is idolatry: “one who is
                        covetous that is, an idolater,” as Ephesians (5:5) says.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        147. – But is covetousness by its nature really a kind
                        of idolatry, and does a covetous person sin as an
                        idolater sins? I say, not specifically, but by
                        resemblance, because a covetous person puts his very
                        life in money. We have idolatry when someone gives to
                        some image the honor owed to God; but a covetous person
                        gives to money the honor owed to God, because he builds
                        his whole life around it. But because a covetous person
                        intends to act towards money as to God, like an
                        idolater, it is a lesser sin.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        148. – Then when Paul says, on account of these the
                        wrath of God is coming, he gives the reason why these
                        sins should be avoided. There are two reasons: the first
                        applies to all; the second applies especially to them.
                        The first is God’s punishment, because on account of
                        carnal sins the wrath of God, that is, God’s punishment,
                        is coming [upon the children of despair], that is,
                        sinners. Such sinners despair of God because lust is the
                        offspring of despair, since many people abandon
                        themselves entirely to things of the flesh because they
                        have despaired of spiritual things. Or, he says children
                        of despair, because of themselves there is no hope for
                        their correction. And so the wrath of God is coming, as
                        in the flood (Gen 6, 7), and on the people of Sodom. The
                        other reason they have for avoiding these sins is that
                        once they did live that way; and so Paul says, in these
                        you once walked, from bad to worse. He gives them this
                        reason, first, because of what Peter says: “Let the time
                        that is past suffice for doing what the Gentiles like to
                        do, living in licentiousness, passions, drunkenness,
                        revels, carousing, and lawless idolatry” (1 Pet. 4:3).
                        Secondly, he mentions this reason because they knew from
                        their own experience that such conduct is not
                        beneficial, but only brings disorder: “But then what
                        return did you get from the things of which you are now
                        ashamed,” as we read in Romans (6:21).

                        one another, seeing that you have put off the old nature
                        with its practices 10 and have put on the new nature,
                        which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of
                        its creator. 11 Here there cannot be Greek and Jew,
                        circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian,

                        First, he lays down a general admonition; and secondly,
                        he divides it into parts.

                        all sin: “So put away all malice and all guile and
                        insincerity and envy and all slander” (1 Pet. 2:1).

                        151. – He divides the spiritual sins into two groups:
                        first, into sins of the heart, secondly, into sins of
                        the mouth, spoken sins. First of all, he mentions anger:
                        “For the anger of man does not work the righteousness of
                        God” (Jas. 1:20); and this must be avoided. Secondly, he
                        mentions wrath, which springs from anger, and occurs
                        when a person considers someone unworthy of what he has,
                        or in comparison with another: “I have no wrath” (Is
                        27:4). Malice then follows after these two, when a
                        person tries to cause injury to his neighbor: “Put away
                        all filthiness and rank growth of wickedness” (Jas.
                        1:21).
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        152. – Then he mentions those sins committed by word;
                        and there are three kinds. Such sins indicate a
                        spiritual disorder. First, such a sin in relation to God
                        is [blasphemy]: “Bring out of the camp him who
                        blasphemed; and let all who hear him lay their hands
                        upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him”
                        (Lev 24:14). And thus all blasphemy is a grievous sin.
                        But what if it is sudden? I answer that if it is so
                        sudden that a person does not realize that he is
                        blaspheming, it is not a grievous sin. But I believe
                        that however suddenly, if a person realizes that he is
                        speaking blasphemous words, he sins in a grievous way.
                        Secondly, he mentions a disorder concerning
                        concupiscence, when he says, put foul talk from your
                        mouth: “Let no evil talk come out of your mouths” (Eph
                        4:29). Thirdly, he mentions a disorder in relation to
                        our neighbor, lying: “A false witness will not go
                        unpunished” (Prov 19:5).
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        153. – Then when he says, seeing that you have put off
                        the old nature, he shows why the vices he has just
                        mentioned must be avoided, the reason being that when
                        one puts off what is old, he should put on what is new:
                        “No one sews an old patch on a new garment,” as we read
                        in Matthew (9:16). First, he talks of putting off what
                        is old, secondly, of putting on what is new (v. 10).
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        154. – So Paul tells us to get rid of these things, put
                        off the old nature, because it has grown old by sin:
                        “What is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to
                        vanish away” (Heb 8:13). This old nature, this old self,
                        is approaching decay, because sin is the road to decay.
                        In addition, sin destroys virtue and spiritual beauty.
                        The oldness of our nature, of course, was brought in by
                        the sin of our first parent: “Therefore as sin came into
                        the world through one man and death through sin, and so
                        death spread to all men because all men sinned” (Rom
                        5:12). This old nature, therefore, or old self, is the
                        oldness of sin: “We know that our old self was crucified
                        with him so that the sinful body might be destroyed”
                        (Rom 6:6). We are to put off this old self with its
                        practices: “Put off your old nature which belongs to
                        your former manner of life and is corrupt through
                        deceitful lusts” (Eph 4:22). The new nature or self is
                        the mind, renewed from within, because before grace our
                        mind is subject within to sin, and when it is renewed by
                        grace it becomes new: “Your youth is renewed like the
                        eagle’s” (Ps 103:5); “For neither circumcision counts
                        for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation”
                        (Gal 6:15). This new creation is renewing grace. Yet,
                        there is an oldness that still remains in our flesh.
                        Nevertheless, if you follow the judgment of the new
                        nature, the new self, you are putting on the new nature
                        or new self; while if you lust according to the desires
                        of the flesh, you are putting on the old self or nature:
                        “Put on the new nature, created after the likeness of
                        God in true righteousness and holiness” (Eph 4:24).

                        155. – Then when Paul says, and have put on the new
                        nature, he describes the new self. First, he shows how
                        this renewal takes place; secondly, where it takes
                        place. He shows that the inner self, having become old
                        by its ignorance of God, is made new by faith and the
                        knowledge of God: “We are being changed into his
                        likeness from one degree of glory to another” (2 Cor
                        3:18). And where is this renewal taking place? It is
                        taking place where the image of God is, and this is not
                        in the sense faculties, but in the mind. And so Paul
                        says, after [in the sense of “with respect to”] the
                        image of its creator. In other words, the image of God
                        in us is being renewed.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        156. – Then (v. 11), he shows that this renewal is for
                        every one, otherwise it would not pertain to human
                        nature as such. And this renewal pertains to all because
                        it was accomplished with respect to what is common to
                        all. Here then we have five ways in which people are
                        different. The first way is by sex, which Paul excludes
                        when he says, here there cannot be [male and female],
                        because men and women do not differ in mind, but in
                        their physical sex. Secondly, people are made different
                        by their native lands, and Paul excludes this when he
                        says, Greek and Jew. For although the Jews were
                        believers and the Greeks unbelievers, yet both have
                        rational minds: “Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he
                        not the God of Gentiles also?” (Rom 3:29). The third
                        distinction is based on rite [as the rite of
                        circumcision], for some had the law, while others did
                        not; yet “The same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his
                        riches upon all who call upon Him,” as Romans (10:12)
                        says. A fourth difference is in language: barbarian,
                        Scythian. Scythia is toward the North. What is barbarous
                        is what is foreign or alien. Thus barbarians are
                        foreigners, and one is absolutely a barbarian who is
                        alien to human nature as such, that is, insofar as it is
                        rational. And so barbarians are those people who are not
                        ruled by reason and laws; they are slaves by nature. But
                        there is no difference in Christ, because although they
                        do not have the civil law, they still have the law of
                        Christ. The final difference is based on state: for some
                        are slave, and others free; but in Christ they are all
                        alike: “The small and the great are there, and the slave
                        is free from his master” (Job 3:19). Therefore, none of
                        these differences exist in Christ, but Christ is all,
                        and in all. For circumcision is obtained through Christ
                        alone, and freedom comes from Christ alone. If you are
                        not free, Christ is your freedom; if you are not
                        circumcised, Christ is your circumcision, and so on. And
                        Christ is in all, because he gives his gifts to all.

                        compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, and patience,
                        13 forbearing one another and, if one has a complaint
                        against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has
                        forgiven you, so you also must forgive. 14 And above all
                        these put on love, which binds everything together in
                        perfect harmony. 15 And let the peace of Christ rule in
                        your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one
                        body. And be thankful. 16 Let the word of Christ dwell
                        in you richly, as you teach and admonish one another in
                        all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, and hymns and
                        spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God.
                        17 And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything
                        in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the
                        Father through him.

                        evil, and here he urges them to accomplish what is good:
                        first, he urges the acts of the particular virtues, and
                        secondly, the acts of those principal virtues that
                        perfect the others (v. 14). First, he reminds them of
                        their present condition; secondly, he gives a list of
                        the virtues (v. 12b).

                        158. – Paul says: If you have put on the new self, you
                        should put on the parts of the new self, that is, the
                        virtues: “Let us then cast off the works of darkness and
                        put on the armor of light” (Rom 13:12). We put these on
                        when our exterior actions are made pleasing by the
                        virtues. But which virtues? Some things are appropriate
                        for soldiers, other things for priests. Put on then what
                        is appropriate for yourself, as God’s chosen ones, holy
                        and beloved. When he says chosen, this refers to the
                        taking away of evil; and holy, refers to the gift of
                        grace. “But you were washed, you were sanctified” (1 Cor
                        6:11); “You shall be holy; for I the Lord your God am
                        holy” (Lev 19:2). When he says beloved, he is referring
                        to their preparation for future glory: “He loved them to
                        the end,” that is, of eternal life (Jn 13:1).

                        which will protect us in good times and in bad times:
                        “With the weapons of righteousness for the right hand
                        and for the left” (2 Cor 6:7). First, he mentions what
                        we must have in prosperity, and secondly, in times of
                        adversity.

                        160. – When times are good we owe compassion or mercy to
                        our neighbor; and so Paul says, compassion: “Through the
                        tender mercy of our God, when the day shall dawn upon us
                        from on high” (Lk 1:78); “If there is any affection and
                        sympathy” (Phil 3:1), that is, compassion springing from
                        love. Secondly, we must show kindness to all. Kindness
                        [benignitas] is like a good fire [bona igneitas]. For
                        fire melts and thaws what is moist, and if there is a
                        good fire in you it will melt and thaw what is moist. It
                        is the Holy Spirit who does this: “The Spirit of wisdom
                        is kind” (Wis 1:6); “Be kind to one another” (Eph 4:32).
                        Lowliness or humility should be found in your hearts:
                        “The greater you are, the more you must humble yourself”
                        (Sir 3:18). In external matters you should practice
                        [moderation], which consists in a certain limit, so that
                        you do not go to extremes in times of prosperity: “Let
                        all men know of your moderation,” as Philippians (4:5)
                        says.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        161. – In the bad times of adversity three kinds of
                        armor are necessary. First, patience, which keeps the
                        soul from giving up the love of God and what is right
                        because of difficulties: “You will save your souls by
                        patience” (Lk 21:19). Sometimes it happens that a person
                        does what is right if he alone is involved, yet he finds
                        that the traits of other persons are insufferable; and
                        to these he says, forbearing one another: “For by what
                        that righteous man saw and heard as he lived among them,
                        he was vexed in his righteous soul day after day with
                        their lawless deeds” (2 Pet 2:8); “We who are strong
                        ought to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to
                        please ourselves,” as we read in Romans (15:1). Thirdly,
                        the armor of pardon is necessary, and so he says,
                        forgiving each other: “What I have forgiven, if I have
                        forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the
                        presence of Christ” (2 Cor 2:10). One forgives an injury
                        when he does not hold a grudge against the person who
                        did it to him, and does not injure him in return. Still,
                        when punishment is necessary, the person committing the
                        injury must be punished. Paul adds the reason why they
                        should forgive, as the Lord has forgiven you: “Does a
                        man harbor anger against another, and yet seek for
                        healing from the Lord?” (Sir 28:3); “1 forgave you all
                        that debt because you besought me” (Mt 18:32), and then
                        he continues, “and should not you have had mercy on your
                        fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?”
                      </p>

                        162. – Then when Paul says, and above all these put on
                        love, he urges them to practice the principal virtues,
                        which perfect the others. Among the virtues, the love of
                        charity holds first place; while among the gifts, wisdom
                        is first. For love is the soul of all the virtues, while
                        wisdom directs them. First, he leads them to the
                        practice of love, and secondly to wisdom (v. 16). First,
                        he urges them to possess the love of charity; secondly,
                        to possess the effects of this love (v. 15).
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        163. – So Paul says, above all these put on love, which
                        is greater than all the virtues mentioned above, as we
                        find stated in 1 Corinthians (13:13). Above all these,
                        that is, more than all the others, because love is the
                        end of all the virtues: “The end of the commandment is
                        love” (1 Tim 1:5). Or we could say, above all these we
                        should have love, because it is above all the rest: “I
                        will show you a still more excellent way” (1 Cor 12:31).
                        Love is above all the rest because without it the others
                        are of no value. This love is the seamless tunic
                        mentioned by John (19:23). The reason we need this love
                        is because it binds everything together in perfect
                        harmony. According to the Gloss, all the virtues perfect
                        man, but love unites them to each other and makes them
                        permanent; and this is why it is said to bind. Or, it is
                        said to bind because it binds of its very nature, for
                        love unites the beloved to the lover: “I led them with
                        cords of compassion, with the bands of love” (Hos 11:4).
                        He says, perfect, because a thing is perfect when it
                        holds firmly to its ultimate end; and love does this.

                        164. – Then (v. 15), he urges them to acts of love. He
                        mentions two of these acts, peace and thankfulness, and
                        implies a third, joy. He says, let the peace of Christ
                        [rejoice] in your hearts. An immediate effect of the
                        love of charity is peace, which is, as Augustine
                        comments, that composure or calmness of order produced
                        in a person by God. Love does this, because when one
                        loves another he harmonizes his will with the other:
                        “Great peace have those who love thy law” (Ps 119:165).
                        He says rejoice, because the effect of this love is joy,
                        and this joy follows peace: “Joy follows those who take
                        counsels of peace” (Prov 12:20). Paul does not merely
                        say “peace,” because there is a peace of this world
                        which God did not come to bring. He says, the peace of
                        Christ, the peace Christ established between God and
                        man. Jesus affirmed this peace: “Jesus himself stood
                        among them, and said to them: Peace to you” (Lk 24:36).
                        And you should have this peace, because it is the
                        peace... to which indeed you were called. “God has
                        called us to peace” (1 Cor 7:15). He adds, in the one
                        body, that is, that you may be in one body. Another
                        effect is thankfulness, and so Paul continues, and be
                        thankful: “The hope of the unthankful will melt away
                        like the winter’s ice” (Wis 16:29).

                        first, he teaches them about the source of wisdom, and
                        secondly its usefulness.

                        166. – In order to have true wisdom, one must inquire
                        into its source, and so Paul says, let the word of
                        Christ dwell in you richly. “The source of wisdom is
                        God’s word in the highest heaven” (Sir 1:5). Therefore
                        you should draw wisdom from the word of Christ: “That
                        will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight
                        of the peoples” (Deut 4:6); “He was made our wisdom” (1
                        Cor 1:30). But some people do not have the Word, and so
                        they do not have wisdom. He says that this wisdom should
                        dwell in us: “Bind them about your neck, write them on
                        the tablet of your heart” (Prov 3:3). For some, a little
                        of Christ’s word is enough, but the Apostle wants them
                        to have much more; thus he says, let the word of God
                        dwell in you richly: “God is able to provide you with
                        every blessing in abundance, so that you may always have
                        enough of everything” (2 Cor 9:8); “Search for it as for
                        hidden treasures” (Prov 2:4). He adds, in all wisdom,
                        that is, you should want to know everything that
                        pertains to the wisdom of Christ: “I did not shrink from
                        declaring to you the whole counsel of God” (Acts 20:27);
                        “The heart of a fool is like a broken jar; it will hold
                        no wisdom” (Sir 21:17) [Vulgate].

                        is true; and so Paul says, as you teach. He is saying,
                        in effect: this wisdom dwells in you so richly that it
                        can teach you all things: “All scripture is inspired by
                        God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for
                        correction, and for training in righteousness” (2 Tim
                        3:16). Secondly, this wisdom instructs us to know what
                        is good, and so Paul says, and admonish one another,
                        that is, encourage yourselves to do good things: “To
                        arouse you by way of reminder” (2 Pet 1:1).

                        169. – Secondly, he mentions its usefulness for
                        devotion, saying, as you sing psalms and hymns. The
                        psalms show the delight of acting well: “Praise him with
                        joy” (Ps 148:2 / 47:1). A hymn is a song of praise: “A
                        hymn for all his saints” (Ps 148:14). And spiritual
                        songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God, because
                        whatever we do, we should relate it to spiritual goods,
                        to the eternal promises, and to the worship of God. And
                        so Paul says, in your hearts, not only with your lips:
                        “I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the
                        mind also” (1 Cor 14:15); “This people draws near with
                        their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their
                        hearts are far from me” (Is 29:13). He adds, with
                        thankfulness, that is, acknowledging the grace of Christ
                        and God’s gifts. The chief songs of the Church are songs
                        of the heart; but they are expressed vocally so as to
                        arouse the songs of the heart, and for the benefit of
                        the simple and uncultured.

                        170. – He mentions the usefulness of this wisdom in
                        directing our actions when he says, and whatever you do,
                        in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord
                        Jesus Christ, because even our speaking is a work:
                        “Whether your eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all
                        to the glory of God” (1 Cor 10:31). Some find a
                        difficulty in this statement of Paul: for what he is
                        saying is either a command or a counsel. If it is a
                        command, then whoever does not do this sins; yet a
                        person sins venially when he does not do this;
                        therefore, whoever sins venially sins mortally. My
                        answer is this: Some say that this is a counsel; but
                        this is not true. Nevertheless, it is not necessary that
                        we refer everything to God in an actual way; it can be
                        done habitually. Whoever acts against the glory of God
                        and his commands, acts against this command. But one who
                        sins venially does not act against this command in an
                        absolute way, because even though he does not refer
                        everything to God in an actual way, he does so
                        habitually.

                        begins to give particular directions. First, he gives
                        special directions which relate to the various states
                        found in the Church; secondly, certain directions which
                        apply to all states in certain conditions (4:2). There
                        are three special directions, according to the three
                        kinds of relationships the Philosopher finds in domestic
                        society: that of husband and wife; father and child; and
                        the master and slaves (v. 22). Each of these is divided
                        into two parts insofar as he urges subjects to obey and
                        their superiors to govern with moderation.

                        adds, as is fitting, because this has been decreed by
                        God’s law: “You shall be under your husband’s power, and
                        he shall have dominion over you” (Gen 3:16); “The women
                        should keep silence in the churches. For they are not
                        permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even
                        the law says” (1 Cor 14:34). The reason for this is that
                        ruling is a function of reason; and because men’s reason
                        is stronger, they should preside. He adds, in the Lord,
                        because all things directed to certain ends must
                        ultimately be referred to God.

                        since a husband and wife are in a certain sense one:
                        “Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the Church”
                        (Eph 5:25). He forbids them to be bitter: “She who is
                        bitter becomes weak in doing good” (Mic 1:12), “Let all
                        bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be
                        put away from you, with all malice” (Eph 4:31).

                        says, children, obey your parents in everything, that
                        is, everything that is not contrary to God: “We have had
                        earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them”
                        (Heb 12:9). But if they command anything which is
                        contrary to God, then we must remember what is said in
                        Luke: “If any one comes to me and does not hate his own
                        father and mother and wife and children and brothers and
                        sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my
                        disciple” (14:26). This is to be done for this pleases
                        the Lord, that is, it is in the Lord’s law, because the
                        law of charity does not destroy the law of nature, but
                        perfects it. And it is a natural law that a child is
                        subject to the care of his father: “Honor your father
                        and your mother” (Ex 20:12).

                        children, he instructs parents: “Fathers, do not provoke
                        your children to anger” (Eph 6:4). They should not do
                        this lest they become discouraged, that is,
                        faint-hearted. Paul gives this advice because adults
                        keep the impressions they have had as children. And it
                        is natural for those raised in slavery to be always
                        faint-hearted. This is the reason why some say that the
                        children of Israel were not immediately led into the
                        promised land: they had been raised in slavery, and
                        would not have had the courage to fight against their
                        enemies: “Say to those who are of a fearful heart: Be

                        he instructs the slaves; secondly, he gives the reason
                        for what he says (v. 24); and thirdly, he clears up a
                        question (v. 25). As to the first, he does two things:
                        first, he tells them to obey; and secondly, how to obey.

                        177. – He says, slaves, according to your state in this
                        world, obey in everything, that is, in everything that
                        is not against God, those who are your earthly masters:
                        “Not only to the kind and gentle but also to the
                        overbearing” (1 Pet 2:18); “Let all who are under the
                        yoke of slavery regard their masters as worthy of all
                        honor” (1 Tim 6:1).

                        178. – Then when he says, not with eyeservice, he
                        teaches them how they are to obey. He shows them two
                        ways to obey: first, with simplicity and without
                        trickery; secondly, willingly. So Paul says, not with
                        eyeservice, that is, not merely to the extent that they
                        can be seen by their master. This same idea is found in
                        Ephesians (6:6). He says, not as men-pleasers, for such
                        persons serve merely to please men. As Galatians says
                        (1:10): “If I were still pleasing men, I should not be a
                        servant of Christ”. And therefore he adds, but in
                        singleness of heart, that is, without trickery, fearing
                        the Lord, as in Job (1:1): “That man was simple and
                        upright, and feared God”; “The simplicity of the upright
                        guides them” (Prov 11:3). Further, they should serve
                        willingly; and so Paul says, whatever your task, work
                        heartily, that is, readily. And they are to do this as
                        serving the Lord, because one who serves another because
                        it is the right thing to do does this because of God,
                        the source of what is right: “He who resists the
                        authorities resists what God has appointed” (Rom 13:2);
                        “Doing the will of God from the heart, rendering service
                        with a good will as to the Lord and not to men” (Eph
                        6:6).
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        179. – Next, he gives two reasons why they should serve
                        this way. The first considers their reward, and the
                        second considers their devotion to God. So Paul says:
                        Serve readily, because from the Lord you will receive
                        the eternal inheritance as your reward: “The lines have
                        fallen for me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly
                        heritage” (Ps 16:6); “Knowing that whatever good any one
                        does, he will receive the same again from the Lord,
                        whether he is a slave or free” (Eph 6:8). Some people
                        were of the opinion that it is not meritorious to
                        accomplish an act of justice, because this seems to be
                        owed to someone, and it is not meritorious to give to
                        someone what is his due. But we should remember that by
                        the very fact that we do this voluntarily, we are doing
                        something of ourselves, because it is in our power to
                        will or not to will; and so such an act is meritorious.
                        Now slaves serve their masters because they owe this to
                        them; and therefore, in order to receive their reward,
                        they should do this voluntarily. But they should serve
                        their masters in such a way that they do not separate
                        themselves from God. The second reason for serving this
                        way is that this is the way one serves the Lord; as we
                        read in Romans (12:11): “Be aglow with the Spirit, serve
                        the Lord.”
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        180. – Then (v. 25), he clears up a question. For a
                        slave might ask: How can I serve a person who harms me?
                        And so Paul replies. It is not up to you to take revenge
                        by taking away from him what is his; rather, wait for
                        the one who can, for the wrong-doer will be paid back
                        for the wrong he has done: “For we must all appear
                        before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may
                        receive good or evil, according to what he has done in
                        the body” (2 Cor 5:10); “There is no partiality with him
                        [God] “ (Eph 6:9); and also in Acts (10:34): “God shows
                        no partiality”.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
                        181. – Next, Paul shows how masters should treat their
                        slaves. He does two things: first, he gives his
                        instructions, secondly, the reason for them. There are
                        two ways a master can oppress his slaves. First, by
                        acting unjustly against them by violating the laws, for
                        according to the laws a master cannot be cruel to his
                        slaves. And so Paul says that masters should treat their
                        slaves justly. Secondly, by demanding that their slaves
                        accomplish absolutely all their duties, which a
                        Christian gentleness would soften; and so Paul says,
                        fairly: “If I have rejected the cause of my manservant
                        or my maidservant, when they brought a complaint against
                        me; what then shall I do when God rises up?” as we read
                        in Job (31:13). Then when he says, knowing that you also
                        have a Master in heaven, Paul gives the reason why they
                        should act this way, and it is this: just as you act
                        towards your slaves, so the Lord will act towards you:
                        “Knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is
                        in heaven” (Eph 6:9).

                        2 Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it
                        with thanksgiving; 3 and pray for us also, that God may
                        open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery
                        of Christ, on account of which I am in prison, 4 that I
                        may make it clear, as I ought to speak. 5 Conduct
                        yourselves wisely toward outsiders, making the most of
                        the time. 6 Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned
                        with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer
                        every one. 7 Tychicus will tell you all about my
                        affairs; he is a beloved brother and faithful minister
                        and fellow servant in the Lord. 8 I have sent him to you
                        for this very purpose, that you may know how we are and
                        that he may encourage your hearts, 9 and with him
                        Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one
                        of yourselves. They will tell you of every thing that
                        has taken place here. 10 Aristarchus my fellow prisoner
                        greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning
                        whom you have received instructions - if he comes to
                        you, receive him), 11 and Jesus who is called Justus.
                        These are the only men of the circumcision among my
                        fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have
                        been a comfort to me. 12 Epaphras, who is one of
                        yourselves, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you,
                        always remembering you earnestly in his prayers, that
                        you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will
                        of God. 13 For I bear him witness that he has worked
                        hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in
                        Hierapolis. 14 Luke the beloved physician and Demas
                        greet you. 15 Give my greetings to the brethren at
                        Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.
                        16And when this letter has been read among you, have it
                        read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that
                        you read also the letter from Laodicea. 17 And say to
                        Archippus, “See that you fulfil the ministry which you
                        have received in the Lord.” 18 I, Paul, write this
                        greeting with my own hand. Remember my fetters. Grace be
                        with you.

                        class of persons; here he gives instructions to
                        everyone. First, he shows what their relationship to
                        others ought to be; and secondly, how some will be
                        acting towards them (v. 7). In regard to the first he
                        does two things. First, he shows how they should act
                        towards him, the Apostle, their prelate; and secondly,
                        towards others, especially, unbelievers (v. 5). In
                        regard to the first he does two things. First, he urges
                        them to pray in general; secondly, to pray for him (v.
                        3).

                        183. – Prayer should have three characteristics: it
                        should be constant, alert, and with gratitude. It should
                        be constant, and so Paul says, continue steadfastly in
                        prayer, that is, pray with perseverance: “Pray
                        constantly” (1 Thess 5:17); “They ought always to pray
                        and not lose heart” (Lk 18:1). It should also be alert,
                        so that the mind does not become oppressed; and so Paul
                        adds, being watchful: “Watch with your prayers” (1 Pet
                        4:7); and in Luke we read: “All night he continued in
                        prayer to God” (Lk 6:12). Prayer should also be with
                        gratitude, that is, with thanksgiving; for if we are
                        ungrateful for the good things we have received, we do
                        not deserve new favors. And so Paul continues, with
                        thanksgiving: “Give thanks in all circumstances” (1
                        Thess 5:18); and in Philippians (4:6) we have “but in
                        everything by prayer and supplication with
                        thanksgiving.”

                        184. – Next, Paul asks them to pray for him, saying, and
                        pray for us also, because subjects should pray for their
                        prelates; for their prelates watch over them, and the
                        welfare of the prelates affects all of their subjects:
                        “Pray for us, that the word of the Lord may speed on and
                        triumph” (2 Thess 3:1). They should pray that God may
                        open to us a door for the word, that is, the door of our
                        mouth, through which the words coming from our heart
                        pass; and they should pray that God give to Paul the
                        grace to preach his word in a fitting manner. This
                        opening also points to something great: “And he opened
                        his mouth and taught them” (Mt 5:2); and so Paul adds,
                        to declare the mystery of Christ: “He utters mysteries
                        in the Spirit” (1 Cor 14:2). And 1, Paul, need these
                        things, because I am suffering for the word of Christ.
                        And so you must pray that I can do so boldly: “The
                        gospel for which I am suffering and wearing fetters like
                        a criminal” (2 Tim 2:9). You must pray that God may
                        open, that is, unblock, to us a door for the word.

                        185. – There are three obstacles which can block the
                        word. One is fear, and so Paul says, I am in prison. The
                        second is its profundity, so that it cannot be
                        understood by the faithful; and so Paul says, that I may
                        make it clear. The third obstacle is that the way it is
                        preached or the time may not be appropriate; and so Paul
                        says, as I ought to speak. “But I brethren, could not
                        address you as spiritual men, but as men of the flesh”
                        (1 Cor 3:1); “Who then is the faithful and wise steward
                        whom his master will set over his household, to give
                        them their portion of food at the proper time?” (Lk
                        12:42).

                        outsiders: first, as to their manner of life; secondly,
                        in what they say (v. 6).

                        187. – Paul says, conduct yourselves wisely toward
                        outsiders, that is, unbelievers. And do so wisely, with
                        wisdom: “For God loves nothing so much as the man who
                        lives with wisdom” (Wis 7:28). The reason for doing this
                        is that they may be making the most of the time. A
                        person makes the most of his trouble when he overlooks
                        what is owing to him, in order to avoid trouble. Now,
                        they were being troubled by these outsiders. And so Paul
                        wants them to make the most of this trouble by means of
                        wisdom: “Maintain good conduct among the Gentiles” (1
                        Pet 2:12).

                        First, it should be gracious; and so he says, let your
                        speech always be gracious; “A gracious tongue multiplies
                        courtesies” (Sir 6:5). Secondly, it should be
                        considerate; and so he says, seasoned with salt. Salt
                        signifies considerateness or discretion, because just as
                        salt makes food savory, so every inconsiderate action is
                        bitter and irregular: “Have salt in yourselves, and be
                        at peace with one another” (Mk 9:50). They should do
                        these things so that you may know how you ought to
                        answer every one. For those who have wisdom should be
                        answered one way; and the foolish are to be answered in
                        another way: “Answer not a fool according to his folly,
                        lest you be like him yourself” (Prov 26:4); “Always be
                        prepared to make a defense to any one who calls you to
                        account for the hope that is in you,” as we read in 1

                        now describes in three ways. First, as to love, saying,
                        a beloved brother, that is, by the love of charity,
                        which makes a person more precious than gold: “A man
                        will be more precious than gold” (Is 13:12). Secondly,
                        he is described as to his faith, a faithful minister:
                        “It is required of stewards that they be found
                        trustworthy” (1 Cor 4:2). Thirdly, from his humility;
                        and so Paul says, fellow servant, in the ministry, but a
                        fellow servant in the Lord, because a prelate should be
                        looking out for the honor of God and for the benefit of
                        those over whom he has charge. Why is Tychicus being
                        sent? To learn the condition of the faithful. “Go now,
                        see if it is well with your brothers, and with the
                        flock; and bring me word again” (Gen 37:14); “See how
                        your brothers fare, and bring some token from them” (1
                        Sam 17:18). He is also to encourage and comfort them:
                        “For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some
                        spiritual gift to strengthen you, that is, that we may
                        be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith” (Rom
                        1:11). Our Lord, who was sent by the Father, also came
                        for this purpose: “to comfort all who mourn” (Is 61:2).
                        Then he mentions his companion, and with him Onesimus.
                        These two will tell you of everything that has taken
                        place here; they will relate what you are doing to me
                        for correction, and tell you what I am doing so you may
                        have an example.

                        greets you, he shows how those who are remaining with
                        the Apostle greet them. The text is clear. And Mark the
                        cousin of Barnabas, concerning whom you have received
                        instructions. We read in Acts (15:37) that a certain
                        person by the name of John, surnamed Mark, had left Paul
                        and Barnabas when they set out on one of their journeys;
                        however, he later returned to them. Barnabas wanted to
                        take him back, but Paul refused. As a result, Paul and
                        Barnabas went their different ways. Later, Paul wrote to
                        the Colossians that they were not to receive Mark. But
                        now, since Mark had changed, he asks them to receive
                        him. Thus, concerning whom you have received
                        instructions: if he comes to you, receive him. Or, it
                        could be understood this way: And Mark the cousin of
                        Barnabas, concerning whom, that is, Barnabas, you have
                        received instructions. And Jesus who is called Justus;
                        he was a holy man, and so was called “Justus” [the
                        Just]. These are the only men of the circumcision, sent
                        to preach the Good News of Christ: “What then? Only that
                        in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is
                        proclaimed; and in that I rejoice” (Phil 1:18). Thus he
                        mentions the Gentiles first, and then the Jews.
                        Epaphras, who is one of yourselves, because he was an
                        Asian. Their wish for the Colossians is “that you may be
                        perfect and complete, lacking in nothing” (Jas 1:4);
                        that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the
                        will of God, that is, in all things relating to the will
                        of God. Then he mentions Luke, who it seems, was not
                        Jewish by birth, because he was from Antioch, and a
                        physician. He singles him out because he had great
                        authority in the Church because of the Gospel he wrote
                        while the Apostle was still alive. He also mentions
                        Demas.

                        Colossians ought to greet: first, those from another
                        church, and secondly, those in their own. We can see
                        from what he says, see that you read also the letter
                        from Laodicea, that Paul wrote other letters: the one to
                        the Laodiceans mentioned here, and another to the
                        Corinthians, besides the first and second, because in 1
                        Corinthians (5:9) he says: “I wrote to you in my letter

                        reasons why they are not in the canon: either there was
                        some doubt about their authority, because they were
                        possibly distorted, and had been destroyed in the
                        churches, or because they contained nothing different
                        from the others.

                        he tells them to warn him: see that you fulfil the
                        ministry which you have received in the Lord: “Fulfil
                        your ministry” (2 Tim 4:5). One is said to fulfil his
                        ministry when he does that for which he received it.
                        Still, it does not seem proper for those in a
                        congregation to warn their own prelate (Ex 19:24). I
                        answer that a member of the congregation is forbidden to
                        rebuke him sharply or insult him, but he can warn him in
                        a charitable way as Paul rebuked Peter (Gal 2:11). But
                        why did he not write to the prelate? Because the prelate
                        exists for the Church and not the Church for the
                        prelate.

                        was the Apostle’s practice to have someone else write
                        the entire letter, and at the end of it he would write
                        something in his own hand, as in 2 Thessalonians (3:17):
                        “I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand.” He does
                        the same here, so that they will not be deceived. [And
                        he says, Remember my fetters, because he was fettered in
                        Rome]: “As an example of suffering and patience,
                        brethren, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the
                        Lord” (Jas 5:10); “Remember your leaders, those who

                        their life, and imitate their faith” (Heb 13:7). Then he
