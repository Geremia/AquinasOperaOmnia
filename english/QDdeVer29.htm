    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It seems that there is not, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. By created grace a man is said to be an adopted son of God. But according
    to the saints’ Christ was not an adopted son. He therefore did not have
    created grace.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Where there is a union of one thing with another through its essence,
    there is no need of union through a likeness. Thus for knowledge there is
    required a union of the knower with the thing known; and yet when things are
    in the soul through their essence, in order to be known they do not need to
    be in the soul through a likeness. But God is really united to the soul of
    Christ by His essence in the unity of the person. There is consequently no
    need of His being united to it through grace, that is, through a likeness.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3 We do not need grace for actions which we can perform by our natural
    powers. But Christ was able to attain glory by His natural powers; for He is
    the natural Son, and if the Son, then the heir also. Now since grace is
    imparted to minds for the purpose of attaining glory, it therefore seems
    that Christ had no need of created grace. 4 A subject can be understood
    without an accident. But if grace was in Christ, it was an accident. Christ
    can therefore be understood without grace; and when He is so understood,
    either eternal life is due Him or not. If it is, then grace will be added to
    no purpose. If not, since eternal life is due to adopted sons because they
    are sons, it seems that adoptive sonship is worth more than natural sonship.
    But that is untenable.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Whatever is good by its essence does not need participated goodness. But
    Christ is good by His essence, because He is true God. He therefore does not
    need grace, which is a. participated goodness.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. Uncreated goodness surpasses the goodness of grace more than the light of
    the sun surpasses that of a candle. But since uncreated goodness was in
    Christ through the union, it therefore seems that He did not need grace.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. The union of the divinity to Christ is either sufficient for Him or not.
    If it is not, the union in question will be imperfect; but if it is
    sufficient, the addition of grace would be superfluous. Now nothing
    superfluous is found in God’s works. Christ therefore did not have created
    grace.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. One who knows something with a nobler kind of knowledge, such as that had
    through a demonstrative medium, does not need to know the same thing with a
    less noble kind of knowledge, as through a probable medium. But Christ was
    good with the noblest goodness, which is uncreated goodness. He therefore
    did not need to be good by a less noble sort of goodness, namely, created
    goodness.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. An instrument does not need a habit for its operation, especially if the
    agent whose instrument it is has perfect power. But the humanity of Christ
    is a kind of “instrument of the divinity” which is united to it, as
    Damascene says. Since the divine power is most perfect, it seems that the
    humanity of Christ did not need grace.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. It is not necessary for anything to be added to one who has the fullness
    of all goodness. But Christ’s soul had the fullness of all goodness because
    the Word, the treasure-house of all goodness, was united to it. It was
    therefore not necessary for the goodness of grace to be added to it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. That by which something is made better is nobler than the thing itself.
    But no creature is nobler than the soul united to the Word. Then Christ’s
    soul cannot be made better by any created grace; and so created grace would
    be useless in it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. The image of God in us is twofold, as is gathered from the Gloss in its
    comment upon the words of the Psalm (4:7): “The light of thy countenance, O
    Lord, is signed upon us.” One is that of creation, which consists in the
    mind considered as one essence with three powers. The other is that of
    re-creation, viewed from the standpoint of the light of grace. Now either
    the image of grace is more like God than the image of Christ’s mind, or not.
    If it is more like God, then grace is a nobler creature than Christ’s soul.
    If it is not more like God, then by its means the mind of Christ would not
    come any closer to conformity with God—which is the purpose for which grace
    is infused into the mind. Grace would therefore be held to be in the soul of
    Christ in vain.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. If effects are incompatible, they will have incompatible causes. just as
    the unifying and the breaking up of a field of vision, for instance, are
    mutually incompatible, so also are white and black. But natural sonship,
    whose principle is eternal birth, is incompatible with adoptive sonship,
    whose principle is the infusion of grace. Thei11nfused grace is also
    incompatible with eternal birth; and since eternal birth applies to Christ,
    it therefore seems that He did not have infused grace.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. It is written in John (1: 14): “We saw... [Him] full of grace and truth.”
    But in Christ there was created knowledge, to which truth refers. Then there
    was also created grace.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Merit requires grace. But Christ merited for Himself and us, as the
    saints Say. Christ therefore had created grace, for it is not attributable
    to the Creator to merit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Christ was at the same time a wayfarer and a possessor. But the
    perfection of a wayfarer is created grace. Christ therefore had created
    grace.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. No perfection found in other souls was missing from Christ’s, since it is
    the most perfect of all. But the souls of saints have not only the
    perfection of nature but also that of grace. Both kinds of perfection were
    therefore found in Christ.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. The relation of grace’ to the wayfarer is the same as that of glory to
    the possessor. But in Christ, who was both wayfarer and possessor, there was
    created glory, because He enjoyed the divinity by a created act.
    Consequently there was created grace in Him.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It is necessary to hold that there was created grace in Christ. The reason
    for this necessity can be gathered from the two different kinds of union
    with God which a soul can have: one consequent upon existence within a
    single person, which belongs uniquely to the soul of Christ; and another
    consequent upon an operation, which <i>is</i> common to all who know and
    love God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The first kind of union is not sufficient for beatitude without the second,
    because not even God Himself would be blessed if He did not know and love
    Himself; for He would not take pleasure in Himself, as is required for
    beatitude. For the soul of Christ to be blessed, then, it requires besides
    its personal union with the Word also a union through its operation, that it
    may see God by His essence and, seeing Him, rejoice. Now this surpasses the
    natural ability of any creature and is proper to God alone according to His
    own nature. Something must therefore be added to the nature of Christ’s soul
    by which it is ordained to the beatitude in question. We call this grace. It
    is therefore necessary to hold that there was created grace in Christ’s
    soul.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This shows the inanity of a certain opinion which affirmed that the higher
    part of Christ’s soul did not have habitual grace but was united immediately
    to the Word and from this union grace flowed into the lower powers. For if
    it refers to personal union, then not only the higher part of Christ’s soul
    but the whole soul is united to the Word. But if it refers to union by
    operation, then habitual grace is required for this kind of union, as has
    been said.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Attributes of such a kind as to belong to a person by reason of
    personality itself cannot be predicated of Christ if they are incompatible
    with the properties of an eternal person, which is the only kind of person
    in Him. An example would be the name <i>creature.</i> But things which
    belong to a person only by reason of his nature or a part of his nature can
    be predicated of Christ, even though they imply some incompatibility with an
    eternal person. This is because of the duality of natures. Examples would be
    to suffer, to die, and the like. Now sonship refers primarily to the person,
    whereas grace refers to the person only by reason of the mind, which is a
    part of the nature. Thus adoptive sonship by no means applies to Christ,
    though having grace does.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. That argument is valid when union by essence and union by likeness are
    ordained to the same end. But that is not true, in the matter at hand. The
    real union of the divinity with Christ’s soul is ordained to personal unity,
    whereas the union by the likeness of grace is ordained to the enjoyment of
    beatitude.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Beatitude is natural to Christ according to His divine nature, but not
    according to His human nature. For this reason He has need of grace.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Should it be asserted that Christ’s soul did not have grace, then
    uncreated beatitude will belong to Christ inasmuch as He is the natural Son,
    but not the created beatitude which is due to adopted sons.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Christ is good by His essence in His divine nature but not in His human
    nature. It is with reference to the latter that He needs the participation
    of grace.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. The light of the sun and of a candle are ordained to the same end, but
    not the union of the divinity to the soul of Christ by nature and that by
    grace. Thus there is no parallel.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. The union of the divinity with Christ’s soul is sufficient for its
    purpose. It does not follow, however, that the union of grace is
    superfluous, because it is ordained to something else.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. Both the nobler and the less noble knowledge are ordained to the same
    end, the cognition of a thing. But that is not the case in the question at
    issue. Hence the conclusion does not follow.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. An instrument can be of either of two kinds: one inanimate, which is
    acted upon and does not act, such as an ax, and such an instrument does not
    need a habit; the other animate, as a slave, which acts and is acted upon,
    and this kind needs a habit. Christ’s humanity is the latter kind of
    instrument of the divinity.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. The fullness of all goodness was, by reason of its personal union with
    the Word, united to Christ’s soul, not formally but personally. For this
    reason it needed to be informed by grace.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. No creature is better, simply speaking, than the soul united personally
    to the Word; but if we speak in a qualified way, nothing prevents it. Color
    was nobler than His body in a certain respect, namely, as being its act. In
    the same way Christ’s grace is better than His soul inasmuch as it is its
    perfection.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. Grace is more like God in a certain respect, inasmuch as it is related
    to Christ’s soul as act to potency. From this point of view Christ’s soul
    was conformed to God through grace. But in other respects His mind itself
    <i>is</i> more like God, that is, from the standpoint of natural properties,
    in which it imitates God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. This is to be answered in the same way as the first difficulty.

        It seems not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Before we can understand an accident inhering in a substance, we must
        understand the substance in the existence of a supposite. But by the
        union of the human nature with the Word the human nature is established
        in the existence of a supposite. Since grace is an accident, it seems
        that the union of the human nature with the Word must be understood
        before grace. Thus grace is not required for the union.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Human nature is capable of being assumed by the Word inasmuch as it
        is rational. And it does not get this from grace. Then it is not
        disposed for the union by grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3 The soul is infused into the body in order that in it the soul may be
        perfected with knowledge and virtues, as the Master makes clear. But
        Christ’s soul is united to the Word before it is to the body; otherwise
        it would follow that a supposite was assumed, for from the union of the
        soul with the body a supposite is constituted. The union of Christ’s
        soul with the Word must therefore be understood before we understand
        grace in it. Thus grace does not dispose for the union in question.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Between the nature and the sup no accident intervenes. But the human
        nature is united to the Word as to a supposite. Grace therefore does not
        intervene there as a disposing medium.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The human nature is united to the Word not only as regards the soul
        but also as regards the body. Now the body is not capable of receiving
        grace. Consequently for the union of human nature to the Word grace is
        not needed as an intervening disposition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. As Augustine says, in miraculous occurrences “the whole reason for
        the miracle is the power of the miracle-worker.” But the union of human
        nature to the divine is a miraculous occurrence above all others. It is
        therefore not necessary to posit a disposition on the part of the
        miracle, but the power of the miracle-worker suffices. Thus no
        intervening grace is required.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Augustine says that whatever belongs to the Son of God by nature
        belongs to the Son of Man by grace. But it belongs to the Son of God by
        nature to be God. This also belongs to the Son of Man, then, by grace.
        But this belongs to Him through the union. Therefore grace is required
        for the union.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Union in person is more excellent than union through fruition. But
        grace is required for the latter union. Then so is it for the former.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The proposition that habitual grace is required for the union in
        question can be understood in two ways: (1) It is required as a
        principle causing the union. To hold that the union in Christ is brought
        about by grace in this sense smacks of the heresy of Nestorius, who held
        that the humanity is united to the Word in Christ in no other way than
        on the basis of a perfect likeness in grace. (2) It is required as a
        disposition. This in turn can be of two kinds: either necessary or
        suitable—necessary, as heat or rarity is a disposition necessary for the
        form of fire, because matter cannot be the proper matter for fire unless
        it is taken together with heat and rarity; or suitable, as beauty is a
        disposition suitable for marriage.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Some therefore say that habitual grace is a necessary disposition, as
        making human nature capable of being assumed. But that does not seem to
        be true. For grace is rather the end of that assumption than a
        disposition for it. Damascene says” that Christ assumed human nature in
        order to cure it. But that curing is accomplished through grace.
        Habitual grace in Christ is accordingly to be understood rather as an
        effect of the union than as a preparation for that union. This is
        indicated in the words of John (1: 14): “We saw him as it were the only
        begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth,” as if the fullness of
        grace belongs to Him by the very fact that He is the Only-begotten of
        the Father through the union.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus habitual grace is not to be understood as a disposition for the
        union except as suitable. In this sense habitual grace can be called the
        grace of union, though more fittingly and more in conformity with the
        meaning of the saints” <i>the grace of union</i> is understood as the
        very existence in the person of the Word, which is conferred upon the
        human nature without any previous merits; but for this, habitual grace
        is not required as it is for the fruition, which consists in an
        operation; for a habit is not a principle of being but of operating.

        It seems that it is, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Everything finite is measured. But the grace of Christ is not
        measured, because the Spirit has not been given to Christ by measure, as
        we read in John (3:34). The grace of Christ is therefore infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. For any finite thing whatsoever God can make a greater. But God could
        not have given Christ greater grace, as the Master says. Then the grace
        of Christ is infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The answer was given that the grace of Christ is said to be finite,
        not because God could not give greater grace, but because the soul of
        Christ was not able to receive greater, for its entire capacity was
        filled with grace.—On the contrary, according to Augustine “the good of
        a creature consists in measure, species, and order; and where these
        three characteristics are great the good is great, and where they are
        small the good is small. Consequently, as a creature grows in goodness,
        the measure grows, and as a result the amount of its capacity is
        increased; for a thing’s measure depends upon its capacity, as Augustine
        says. Thus the more his grace is increased, the more the capacity in the
        soul of Christ is increased.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Anselm proves that God had to be incarnated because atonement for
        human nature could not be made except through infinite merit, which
        could not be that of a mere man. From this it is evident that the merit
        of Christ as man was infinite. But the cause of merit is grace. The
        grace of Christ was therefore infinite, because an infinite effect
        cannot proceed from a finite cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The charity of a wayfarer can increase to infinity, because however
        much a man advances in this life, he can always advance still further.
        Now if the grace of Christ were finite, the grace of some other man
        could increase to such an extent that it would be greater than Christ’s,
        and so that man would be better than Christ. But that is inadmissible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The capacity of Christ’s soul is either finite or infinite. If it is
        infinite, and its entire capacity full, then He has infinite grace. If,
        on the other hand, it is finite, and for anything finite God can make
        something greater, then He can make a greater capacity than that had by
        Christ’s soul; and so He can make Christ better. But that seems to be
        absurd.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. It was answered that God could make a greater capacity as far as He
        is concerned, but a creature would not be able to receive it.—On the
        contrary, the most excellent creature stands at an infinite distance
        from God. There are therefore an infinite number of intermediate degrees
        between God and the most excellent creature. Thus for any created
        goodness or capacity God can make a better.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Nothing finite has power over an infinite number of things. But the
        grace of Christ had such power, for it had power over the salvation of
        an infinite number of men and over the effacement of an infinite number
        of sins. The grace of Christ was therefore infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Nothing created is infinite; otherwise a creature would be equal to
        the Creator. But the grace of Christ was something created. Therefore it
        was finite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It is written in Wisdom (11: 2 1): “Thou hast ordered all things in
        measure, and number, and weight.” But nothing infinite has definite
        weight and measure. All things, therefore, which are made by God are
        finite; and so the grace of Christ is not infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The occasion for the introduction of this question was the Passage in
        John (3:34): “For God doth not give the Spirit by measure.” We must
        therefore get an understanding of these words in order to get at the
        truth of the present question.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There may first of all come to mind an interpretation of those words in
        which the Spirit is said not to be given to Christ in measure, because
        the Holy Spirit, who is infinite, filled Christ by means of grace. But
        that interpretation is not in accord with the meaning of the text. For
        the words under discussion are introduced in order to distinguish
        between Christ and John [the Baptist] and all the saints, as the Gloss
        points out. In that interpretation Christ does not differ in this
        respect from creatures; for the Holy Spirit, who is the third person of
        the Trinity, both is infinite in Himself and dwells in each one of the
        saints.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For this reason another interpretation is set down in the Gloss: the
        words in question refer to eternal generation, in which the Father gave
        the Son an infinite nature, so that by “spirit” is understood the
        spiritual divine nature. The Gloss accordingly says: “That there should
        be a Son just as great as the Father, the Father begot a Son equal to
        Himself.” But this meaning does not agree with the words that follow;
        for the passage continues (John 3: 3 5): “The Father loveth the Son,” so
        that it is to be understood as if the love of the Father for the Son is
        the reason for the giving that is spoken of. Nor can it be said that
        love is the reason for the eternal generation, since personal love is
        rather from the generation. Essential love, of course, pertains to the
        will; but we do not grant that the Father begot the Son by will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Still another interpretation is accordingly given in the Gloss: the
        statement refers to the union of the Word with the human nature. For the
        very Word of God, which is the divine wisdom, is communicated to each
        creature in some definite measure inasmuch as God has spread indications
        of His wisdom through all His works, according to the words of Sirach
        (1: 10): “And he poured her (wisdom) out upon all his works, and upon
        all flesh, according to his gift: and hath given her to them that love
        him.” But the Word Itself is united to the human nature in Christ fully,
        without measure, so that by “the spirit” which is not given “by measure”
        is understood the Word of God. Hence the Gloss explains: “As the Father
        begot the Word full and perfect, so It is united to human nature full
        and perfect.” But this interpretation also does not agree in all
        respects with the following words. For the gift of which the words under
        discussion speak was made to the Son, as is shown in the words which are
        added (John 3:3 5): “The Father loveth the Son: and He hath given all
        things into his hand.” Now by the union nothing has been given to the
        Son, but it has been given to a man to be the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The words in question therefore seem to refer properly to habitual
        grace, in which the Holy Spirit is shown to have been given to the soul
        of Christ, the union by which that man was the Son of God being
        presupposed. Now this grace, absolutely speaking, was finite; but in a
        certain sense it was infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To get a clear understanding of this matter we should bear in mind that
        <i>finite</i> and <i>infinite</i> are taken with reference to quantity,
        as the Philosopher makes clear. Now there are two kinds of quantity:
        dimensive, which is referred to extension; and virtual, which is
        referred to intensity; for the excellence (<i>virtus</i>) of a thing is
        its perfection, as the Philosopher teaches: “Anything is perfect when it
        attains its proper excellence”; and the virtual quantity of each form is
        considered according to the degree of its perfection. Both kinds of
        quantity are differentiated into many species. Under dimensive quantity
        are included length, width, and depth, and potentially number. Virtual
        quantity is distinguished into as many classes as there are natures and
        forms, whose degree of perfection constitutes all the measure of
        quantity that they have.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now it sometimes happens that what is finite as regards one sort of
        quantity is infinite as regards another. This is easily seen if we take
        dimensive quantity in both cases, for we can conceive a surface which is
        finite in width but infinite in length. It is also clear if we take one
        dimensive quantity and another virtual; for if we conceive an infinite
        white body, its whiteness will not on this account be infinite in
        intensity, but only (indirectly) in extension; for something whiter
        might be found. The same is no less evident if both quantities are
        virtual; for in one and the same subject different virtual quantities
        can be taken into consideration on the basis of different formalities of
        the attributes predicated of this subject. Thus if a thing is called a
        being, virtual quantity is considered in it with regard to the
        perfection of existing; and if it is called sentient, this quantity is
        considered with regard to the perfection of sensing; and so on.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        With regard to the formality of existing, then, only that can be
        infinite which includes all the perfection of existing—a perfection
        which is capable of being diversified in an infinite number of different
        modes. In this respect only God is infinite essentially, because His act
        of existing is not limited to any determined perfection but embraces
        every mode of perfection to which the formality of being can extend. For
        this reason He is essentially infinite. This kind of infinity cannot
        apply to any creature, for the act of existing of every creature is
        limited to the perfection of its own species. If, then, we conceive of a
        sentient soul which has in it whatever can contribute in the perfection
        of sensing in any way whatsoever, that soul will be finite essentially,
        because its act of being is limited to a particular perfection of
        existing, namely, sentience, which is surpassed by another perfection,
        intelligence. Yet it would be infinite as regards the formality of
        sentience, because its sentience would not be limited to any definite
        mode of sensing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In like manner I say of the habitual grace of Christ that it is
        essentially finite because its act of being is limited to a particular
        species of being, that of grace; yet it is infinite in the line of
        grace. For, although a person’s perfection in point of grace can be
        considered to be of any one of an infinite number of modes, no one of
        them was wanting to Christ, but He had grace in all the fullness and
        perfection to which the formality of this species, grace, can extend.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This interpretation [of the words quoted at the beginning of this reply]
        the Gloss expressly sets down, saying: “God gives the spirit to men by
        measure, to the Son not by measure; but just as He begot His Son wholly
        from Himself, so to His incarnate Son He gave His spirit wholly, not in
        part, not by any subdivision, but universally and generally.” Augustine
        also says that Christ is the head, in which all the senses are located;
        but in the saints, to whom the spirit is given by measure, there is
        only, as it were, the sense of touch.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus it must be said that the grace of Christ was finite essentially,
        but it was infinite in the perfection of the specific formality of
        grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. This answer is obvious from what has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Because grace is finite essentially but infinite in the line of
        grace, God can make a better essence than that of grace, but nothing
        better in the genus of grace, since the grace of Christ includes
        everything to which the specific formality of grace can extend.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The capacity of a creature is predicated on the potency of reception
        which it has. Now the potency of a creature to receive is of two kinds.
        One is natural; and this can be entirely fulfilled, because it extends
        only to natural perfections. The other is obediential potency, inasmuch
        as it can receive something from God; and such a capacity cannot be
        filled, because whatever God does with a creature, it still remains in
        potency to receive from God. Now a measure which increases when goodness
        increases is determined by the amount of perfection received rather than
        by that of the capacity to receive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Form is the principle of act; but in so far as it has existence in
        act, it is not possible for an action infinite in intensity to proceed
        from a form whose essence is finite. Hence even the merit of Christ was
        not infinite in the intensity of the act, for He loved and knew
        finitely. But it had a certain infinity from the circumstance of the
        person, who was of infinite dignity; for the greater the one who humbles
        himself, the more praiseworthy his humility is found to be.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Even though the charity or grace of a wayfarer can increase to
        infinity, it can never arrive at equality with the grace of Christ. That
        something finite can by a continuous increase attain to any finite
        degree however great, is true if the same sort of quantity is referred
        to in both of the finite factors (for example, if we compare a line to a
        line or whiteness to whiteness), but not if different sorts of quantity
        are referred to. This is evident in dimensive quantity; for no matter
        how much a line is increased in length, it will never reach the width of
        a surface.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The same likewise appears in virtual or intensive quantity; for no
        matter how much the knowledge of one who knows God by a likeness may
        advance, it can never equal the knowledge of a possessor, who sees God
        through His essence. Similarly the charity of a wayfarer cannot equal
        the charity of a possessor; for a person is,differently affected toward
        things which are present and toward those which are absent. In like
        manner also, however much the grace of a man who possesses grace in the
        line of a particular participation may increase, it can never equal the
        grace of Christ, which is full in every respect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The capacity of Christ’s soul is finite, and God can make a greater
        capacity and a better creature than the soul of Christ if the latter is
        separated in thought from the Word. Yet it does not follow that He could
        make Christ better, because Christ has His goodness from another, that
        is, from union with the Word, from which point of view His goodness
        cannot be conceived to be greater.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The answer to this is clear from what has just been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. From the circumstance of the person Christ’s soul has power over an
        infinite number of things; and that is also the source from which His
        merit has infinity, as was said above.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. It is characteristic of the head to have an influence upon the
        members. But Christ in His human nature does not have an influence upon
        men, that is, not a spiritual influence, because such an influence
        relates especially to the soul. For, as is brought out in the comment in
        the Gloss on John 5:2, taken from Augustine, souls are vitalized by the
        Word of God; bodies, by the Word made flesh. Therefore Christ in His
        human nature is not the head of the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It was said in answer that Christ has an influence upon souls
        efficiently in His divine nature and dispositively in His human nature.
        On the contrary, the ministers of the Church, as dispensers of the
        sacraments, dispose men for spiritual life; for a sacrament is a
        dispositive cause of grace. But the ministers of the Church are not
        called the head of the Church. Then neither is Christ as a dispositive
        cause to be called the head of the Church.
      </p>

        3. The Church would have existed even if man had not sinned, but the
        Word of God would not have assumed human nature, as is said in a comment
        in the Gloss upon the words of the first Epistle to Timothy (1: 15):
        “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.” But the Church
        cannot be without a head. Christ is therefore not the head of the Church
        in His human nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4 It was said that, had man not sinned, Christ would have been the head
        of the Church inasmuch as He is the Word of God, whereas after that sin
        He is the head inasmuch as He is the Word made flesh.—On the contrary,
        for the full reparation of mankind it is required that man should not be
        indebted for his salvation to anyone to whom he was not previously
        indebted. For this reason, as Anselm says, reparation could not be made
        by an angel. But if Christ had been the head of the Church before only
        as the Word, man would not have been indebted to any creature for his
        salvation, whereas after his sin he is indebted to Christ in His human
        nature if Christ is the head in this nature. It would therefore seem
        that full reparation of mankind has not been effected. But that is
        inadmissible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The good angels and men belong to one Church. But there is one head
        of the one Church. Since Christ is not the head of the good angels, who
        have never sinned and are, moreover, not like Him in nature, it
        therefore seems that He is not the head of men either in His human
        nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The head is a member of the body. Christ, however, is not a member of
        the Church, so it seems, because to be a member implies partiality and
        therefore imperfection. Christ is therefore not the head of the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. According to the Philosopher, “the heart is the source of sensation,
        motion, and life.” Now if Christ deserves any name by reason of a
        spiritual influence, it is rather <i>heart</i> than
        <i>head,</i> particularly since the head undergoes the influence of the
        heart, whereas Christ does not undergo that of any member of the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The Church is the congregation of the faithful. But Christ did not
        have faith. Then if Christ is the head of the Church, He will not be
        like the members. But that is contrary to the notion of a head.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. The head does not come after the members. But many of the members of
        the Church came before Christ. Consequently Christ is not the head of
        the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The answer was given that, although Christ did not then exist in the
        real order of things, He did exist in the faith of the fathers.—On the
        contrary, as head of the Church Christ imparts grace to its members. Now
        if it fulfills the notion of a head that Christ existed in the faith of
        believers, it accordingly seems that the supply of grace in the Old
        Testament was equal to that in the New. But that is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. What does not exist cannot act. But when Christ existed only in the
        faith of the fathers, He did not have existence in Himself in His human
        nature. He could therefore not exercise influence, and so could not be
        the head.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Every proposition whose subject is a conceptual being and the
        predicate is a real being is false; for example, if one were to say that
        a genus or species runs. But as existing in faith Christ is designated
        as a conceptual being. Since to be head or to exercise influence implies
        a real being, it therefore seems that the proposition “As existing in
        faith Christ is the head of the Church” is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. There is one head of one body. But Christ is the head of the Church
        in His divinity. Then He is not the head in His humanity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. A head does not have a head. But God is Christ’s head (1 Corinthians
        11:3). Christ is therefore not the head of the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. It belongs to the notion of a head to have all the senses that there
        are in the body, as Augustine points out. But there are some spiritual
        senses in the Church that are not in Christ, namely, faith and hope.
        Christ is therefore not the head of the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. On the words of the Epistle to the Ephesians (1: 2 2): “He hath...
        made him head...” the Gloss comments: “Things are subjected to Him as
        their head, from whom they originate.” Now men and angels do not
        originate from Christ in His human nature but in His divine nature.
        Consequently Christ is the head of the Church not in His human but in
        His divine nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        17. Augustine says that to enlighten souls is an act proper to God
        alone. It is therefore not proper to Christ in His human nature.
        Consequently Christ in His human nature is not the head of the Church.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The union of the head with the body is based upon a conformity in
        nature. Now Christ’s conformity to the Church is not in His divine
        nature but in His human nature. Therefore Christ in His human nature is
        the head of the Church.

        The term <i>head</i> as applied to spiritual beings is taken in a
        transferred sense from the head of a physical body. To see in what sense
        Christ is the head of the Church we must accordingly consider the
        relationship of a head to the members of a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The head is found to stand in a twofold relationship of distinction and
        conformity to the other members. There is distinction in three respects:
        (1) in point of dignity, because the head fully possesses all the
        senses, but the other members do not; (2) in point of government,
        because the head governs and regulates all the other members in their
        acts by means of both the external and the internal senses, which have
        their seat in the head; (3) in point of causality, for the head causes
        sensation and motion in all the members, and hence physicians say that
        the nerves Aid everything pertaining to the apprehensive and motive
        powers of animals originate in the head. The conformity of the head to
        the members is also found to be threefold: (1) in nature, for the head
        and the rest of the members are parts of one nature; (2) in order, for
        there is a union of order between the head and the members inasmuch as
        the members are of service to each other, as is pointed out in the first
        Epistle to the Corinthians(12:25); (3) in continuity, for the head is
        continuous with the other members in a physical body. In accordance with
        these points of conformity and distinction the term <i>head</i> is
        attributed metaphorically to different beings in different ways.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There are some things among which there is conformity in nature. To one
        of these the term head is attributed only by reason of its eminence or
        dignity. Thus the lion is said to be the head of the animal kingdom, or
        a certain city is called the head of the realm because of its dignity.
        Isaiah (7:8), for instance, says: “The head of Syria is Damascus.”
        Certain other things have mutual conformity in a union of order, being
        ordained to one end. Among these the term <i>head</i> is attributed by
        reason of government, which is concerned with the relation to an end.
        Thus princes are called the heads of the people. For example, it is
        written in Amos (6:1): “Ye great men, heads of the people...” But where
        there is continuity, head is predicated by reason of influence, as a
        spring is called the head of a river.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In these three different ways Christ in His human nature is called the
        head of the Church. He is of specifically the same nature as other men;
        and so the name head belongs to Him by reason of His dignity, on the
        grounds that grace is found more abundantly in Him. In the Church we
        also find a unity of order, since the members of the Church are of
        service to each other and are ordained to God; and in this respect
        Christ is called the head of the Church as its ruler. We also find in
        the Church a certain continuity by reason of the Holy Spirit, who, being
        one and numerically the same, fills and unites the whole Church. Christ
        in His human nature is accordingly called the head by reason of His
        influence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In causing spiritual sensation and motion a thing can be understood to
        be operative in two ways: (1) As a principal agent. In this way it
        belongs to God alone to pour grace into the members of the Church. (2)
        Instrumentally. In this way the humanity of Christ also is the cause of
        that in-pouring. For as Damascene says, just as iron burns because of
        the fire joined to it, the actions of Christ’s humanity were salutary”
        because of the divinity united to it, of which the humanity was like an
        instrument. This seems to be enough for the notion of a head. For even
        the head of a physical body does not exercise its influence upon the
        members except by reason of its latent power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the second and third respects in which something is called a head
        Christ in His human nature can be called the head of the angels, and He
        can be called the head of both angels and men in His divine nature; but
        not in the first respect, unless we take the community involved to be
        based on their generic nature, seeing that man and the angels have in
        common the rationality of their nature; and in addition a community of
        analogy, seeing that, as Basil points OUt, the Son has in common with
        all creatures the reception of His nature from the Father, by reason of
        which He is called “the firstborn of every creature” (Colossians 1:15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If, then, we are to speak properly, the whole Christ in both of His
        natures together is the head of the whole Church in the three respects
        mentioned. And the Apostle proves that Christ is the head of the Church
        in these three respects, saying (Colossians 1:18-20): “He is the head of
        the body, the church— who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
        that in all things he may hold the primacy” (referring to government):
        “because in him, it hath well pleased the Father that all fullness
        should dwell” (referring to dignity): “and through him to reconcile all
        things” (referring to influence).

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Vitalizing both souls and bodies is attributed to the divinity of the
        Word as the principal agent and to the humanity as an instrument. The
        life of souls, however, is attributed to the divinity of the Word and
        the life of bodies to the humanity by a kind of appropriation in order
        to bring out the conformity between the head and the members, in the
        same way in which the passion is called the cause of the forgiveness of
        sin, and the resurrection, the cause of justification.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The other ministers of the Church neither dispose men for spiritual
        life nor contribute to it by their own power but do so by the power of
        another, whereas Christ does this by His own power. This is why Christ
        could bring about the effects of the sacraments by Himself, for the
        whole efficacy of the sacraments was in Him as its origin; but the other
        ministers of the Church cannot do so. Hence they cannot be called the
        head unless perhaps by reason of governing, in the same sense as any
        prince is called a head.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. If we assume the opinion that Christ would not have become incarnate
        if man had not sinned, then before the sin Christ would have been the
        head of the Church in His divine nature alone, but since the sin He must
        be the head of the Church in His human nature as well. For by sin human
        nature has been wounded and immersed in sensible things so that it is no
        longer sufficiently suited to the invisible government of the Word. For
        this reason medicine had to be applied to the wound through Christ’s
        humanity, through which He made atonement. He also had to assume a
        visible nature in order that man might be recalled to invisible things
        through a visible exercise of government.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Christ’s human nature takes on a certain infinity in dignity by being
        united to the divine nature personally. As a result it is not insulting
        to man to be indebted for his salvation to Christ in His human nature,
        because the human nature works by the power of the divine, as has been
        said. Thus we venerate Christ in both His natures with the same
        veneration, that of <i>latria</i>.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Christ is the head of the angels not only in His divine nature but
        also in His human nature, because even in His human nature He enlightens
        them, as Dionysius teaches.”Thus He is said in the Epistle to the
        Colossians (1:16) to be the head of all principalities and powers. Yet
        Christ’s humanity is related differently to angels than to men in two
        respects: (1) as to His conformity in nature, being in the same species
        as men but not as the angels; (2) as to the end of the Incarnation,
        which was carried out principally for the sake of man’s liberation from
        sin; and so Christ’s humanity is ordained to the influence which He
        exercises upon men as the end intended, whereas His influence upon the
        angels is not the end of the Incarnation but a consequence of the
        Incarnation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Christ is expressly said by the Apostle (1 Corinthians 12:27) to be a
        member of the Church: “You are the body of Christ and members of
        member.” Now He is called a member by reason of His distinction from the
        other members of the Church, but He is distinguished from the other
        members by reason of His perfection (because grace is in Christ in its
        fullness, but not in any one of the others), just as the head of a
        physical body is distinguished from the other members. Hence there is no
        need of attributing any imperfection to Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The heart is a hidden member, but the head is apparent. By the heart,
        accordingly, the divinity of Christ or the Holy Spirit can be meant; but
        by the head, Christ Himself in His visible nature, which is under the
        influence of the nature of the invisible divinity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Christ had perfect knowledge of the things about which others have
        faith. Thus as regards knowledge He is conformed to the others as the
        perfect to the imperfect. That is the sort of conformity that is
        conceived between the head and the members.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Christ as man is the mediator between God and men, as is said in the
        first Epistle to Timothy (2:5). Now God is said to justify us in two
        ways: principally by His own action inasmuch as He is the efficient
        cause of our salvation, and also by our operation inasmuch as He is the
        end known and loved by us. In the same way, then, Christ as man is said
        to justify us in two ways: (1) By His own action, inasmuch as He merited
        and atoned for us. In this respect He could not be called the head of
        the Church before the Incarnation. (2) By our operation in His regard,
        in the sense that we are said to be justified by faith in Him. In this
        respect He could be the head of the Church in His humanity even before
        the Incarnation. In both ways, moreover, He is the head of the Church in
        His divinity, both before and after the Incarnation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Because the merit of Christ was not yet actual, nor was there
        atonement before the Incarnation, there was not the same fullness of
        grace as there was afterwards.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Christ has a claim to the title of head not only by His own action,
        but also by our action in His regard. The argument therefore proves
        nothing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. The predicates “to be the head” or “to exercise influence” in the
        sense of “through our operation in His regard, inasmuch as we believe in
        Him” are not real beings but only conceptual. Hence the conclusion does
        not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. “The one Christ is God and man.” Consequently, from the fact that
        Christ is the head of the Church in His humanity and in His divinity it
        cannot be concluded that the Church has two heads.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. We do not say in exactly the same sense that God is the head of
        Christ and that Christ is the head of the Church. The difficulty is
        therefore arguing from an equivocation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. Whatever perfection there is in faith and hope belongs to Christ in
        its entirety. Only the imperfection which they contain is denied in His
        regard.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. Although in one respect Christ is the head in His divinity, the
        possibility of His being the head in His humanity in another respect is
        not thereby removed; for we draw our spiritual origin from Christ in His
        humanity, as is written in John (1:16): “Of His fullness we have all
        received.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        17. It is proper to God alone to enlighten souls principally and
        effectively. It is not in this sense that Christ in His humanity has a
        spiritual influence upon us, but in another, as has been said.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The Apostle in writing to the Colossians (1: 19) places the headship
        in Christ “because in him, it hath well pleased the Father that all
        fullness should dwell,” as appears in the passage quoted above. But all
        the fullness of the divinity dwells in Christ from the union. Besides
        the union, then, no grace is required for Him to be the head.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Christ is the head of the Church in so far as He works for our
        salvation. But, as Damascene says, the action of His humanity conferred
        salvation upon us inasmuch as the humanity was in a way “the instrument
        of the divinity.” Now since an instrument does not require any habit but
        moves only when moved by the principal agent, it seems that Christ did
        not require habitual grace in order to be the head.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The action of one man can contribute to the salvation of another in
        two ways: (1) Inasmuch as he acts as an individual person. Then grace is
        required in order that his action may be meritorious for himself or for
        another. (2) As a person representing the community. This applies to the
        ministers of the Church, who work for the salvation of others by
        administering the sacraments and pouring forth prayers to God in the
        name of the Church. No grace is needed for this but only a power or
        state, for such actions are performed not only by good but also by
        wicked men. Now Christ as head of the Church is considered as a person
        representing the community, and all the ministers of the Church are His
        vicars. He therefore had no need of habitual grace in order to be the
        head.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Christ wis the head of the Church because His merit was infinite.
        Thus He was able to exercise an influence upon all the members of the
        Church and wipe out their sins. But He did not get the infinity of His
        merit from habitual grace, which was finite. Christ was therefore not
        the head by reason of any habitual grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Christ is the head of the Church inasmuch as He is the “mediator of
        God and man” (1 Timothy 2:5). But He is the mediator of God and man
        inasmuch as He is intermediate between God and men, having divinity with
        God and humanity with men. Now this comes from the union. Consequently
        the union alone without habitual grace is enough for the headship.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. One subject has one life. But grace is the life of the soul. In one
        soul there is therefore one grace; and so in Christ besides the grace
        which is His as an individual person there is not required any other
        habitual grace by which He is the head.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Christ is the head because He influences the members of the Church.
        But no matter how much grace He had, He could not influence them unless
        He were God and man. Consequently no habitual grace by which He is the
        head is required, but He has this position from the union alone.

        1. There are the words of John (1:16): “Of His fullness we all have
        received: and grace for grace.” Thus He had some grace by which He in
        turn poured out grace upon us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The head of the Mystical Body has some resemblance to the head of a
        physical body. But for the perfection of a physical body it is required
        that the power of sensation be in the head most fully in order that it
        can communicate sensation to the members. In Christ too, then, for Him
        to be the head the fullness of grace is required.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Dionysius says that those who have the office of enlightening,
        perfecting, and cleansing others first have light, cleanness, and
        perfection themselves. But as head of the Church Christ cleanses,
        enlightens, and perfects. In order to be the head, therefore, He must
        have the fullness of grace, by which He is pure, full of light, and
        perfect.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As Damascene says, the humanity of Christ in some sense “was the
        instrument of the divinity”; and for this reason His actions could be
        salutary for us. Inasmuch as it was the instrument of the divinity,
        then, it had to have a special connection with the divinity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The closer a substance stands to the goodness of God, the more fully it
        participates in His goodness, as Dionysius makes clear. Consequently the
        humanity of Christ also, because it is connected with the divinity more
        closely than the others and in a more special way, has participated in
        the divine goodness through the gift of grace in a more excellent way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As a result there was a fitness in this humanity not only to have grace
        but also to communicate it to other beings, as the most shining bodies
        transmit the light of the sun to others. And because in some sense
        Christ communicates the effects of grace to all rational creatures, this
        is why He is in some sense the source of all grace in His humanity, just
        as God is the source of all being. Then, as all the perfection of being
        is united in God, in Christ the fullness of all grace and virtue is
        found, and because of it He not only is capable of the work of grace
        Himself but can bring others to grace. For this reason He has the
        headship.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In a physical head there is not only the power of sensing, in order that
        it may sense by sight, hearing, and touch and such senses; but this
        power is in it in such a way that it is the root from which sensation
        flows into all the other members. In Christ, accordingly, one and the
        same habitual grace is called the grace of union as befitting a nature
        united to the divinity, and the grace of headship as the means by which
        grace is communicated to others for their salvation, and also the grace
        of an individual person as perfecting Him for meritorious works.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. In Christ two different kinds of fullness are referred to: one, of
        the divinity, according to which Christ is fully God; and the other, of
        grace, according to which He is said to be full of grace and truth. It
        is of this latter fullness that the Apostle speaks in Colossians
        1:18-20, and of the former in Colossians 2:9. The second is derived from
        the first and by it the grace of headship is formally constituted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. An inanimate instrument such as an ax does not need a habit; but an
        animate instrument such as a servant does. The human nature in Christ is
        such an instrument.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. A minister of the Church does not act in the sacraments by his own
        power but by the power of another, that is, Christ. The minister
        accordingly does not need personal grace but only the authority of
        orders, by which he is constituted the vicar of Christ. But Christ
        wrought our salvation by His own power. The fullness of grace was
        therefore necessary in Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Although Christ’s merit has a certain infinity from the dignity of
        the person, it gets its meritoriousness from habitual grace, without
        which there cannot be any merit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Christ is the mediator between God and men even in His human nature,
        in so far as He has passibility together with men, and justice together
        with God. But His justice is in Him by means of grace. For this reason
        besides the union there is required habitual grace in Christ in order
        that He may be the mediator and the head.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. One and the same habitual grace is from different points of view the
        grace of the head, the grace of an individual person, and the grace of
        union, as was explained above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Although both natures are required in Christ for Him to be the head,
        from the union of the divine nature with the human there results in the
        human nature a certain fullness of grace, which issues in an overflow
        from Christ the head into others.

        It seems that He could not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. All merit proceeds from free choice, which is undetermined with
        regard to many things. But in Christ free choice is determined to good.
        He therefore could not merit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The relation of the one meriting to the reward is the same as that of
        a recipient to the thing received, because a person merits in order to
        receive what he merits. But “the recipient must be devoid of the thing
        received,” as is made clear in <i>The Soul.</i> Then one who merits must
        be without reward. But that cannot be said of Christ, since He was a
        true possessor. It therefore seems that Christ could not merit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Whatever is due to someone does not have to be merited. But because
        Christ was a possessor, impassibility of mind and body was due Him. He
        therefore did not merit these.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Merit does not have to do with events that occur necessarily as if by
        a natural sequence, because merit concerns that which is voluntarily
        given by another in return for something as its recompense. But the
        glory of the body comes from the glory of the soul by a certain natural
        sequence, as is seen from Augustine. Since Christ was blessed in His
        soul, enjoying as He did the possession of the divinity, it seems that
        He could not merit the glory of the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The saints who are now in glory have glory of soul and not of body,
        just as Christ had before His passion. But the saints do not now merit
        the glory of the body. Then neither did Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The same thing cannot be the principle and the term of merit, and so
        the same thing cannot be the reward and the principle of meriting. But
        the charity which was found in Christ was a part of His reward, because
        it belonged to the perfection of His beatitude, since by its means He
        had enjoyment. It could therefore not be the principle of meriting. But
        all merit is from charity. Consequently there could not have been any
        merit in Christ.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Do away with what goes before, and you do away with what comes after.
        But before all else merit refers to the blessedness of the soul, which
        Christ did not merit, because He had it from the instant of His
        conception. Then neither could He have merited anything else.

        1. On the words of the Psalm (15: 1): “Preserve me, O Lord,” the Gloss
        comments: “Behold the reward”; and on the words “for I have put my trust
        in thee” the comment is: “behold the merit.” Christ therefore merited.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Whoever is given any recompense in proportion to his deed, merits.
        But because of the humility of His passion Christ was given the
        recompense of exaltation, as is shown in the Epistle to the Philippians
        (2:9): “For which cause, God also hath exalted him...” Therefore Christ
        merited.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Merit is the act of a wayfarer just as enjoyment is that of a
        possessor. But as a possessor Christ had enjoyment. Then He also merited
        as a wayfarer.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Christ merited before His passion when He was both a wayfarer and a
        possessor. This is shown as follows. There are two requisites for merit:
        the state of one who merits and the ability to merit. For the state of
        one who merits, the lack of that which is said to be merited is
        required, though some say that a person can merit what he already has.
        Thus they say of the angels that they merited their blessedness, which
        they received simultaneously with grace, by the subsequent actions
        performed with regard to us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But this does not seem to be true for two reasons: (1) Because it is
        contrary to Augustine’s argument, by which he proves against the
        Pelagians that grace cannot fall under merit because before grace there
        are no deserts except evil, since before receiving grace man is a sinner
        and not grace but punishment is what sinners deserve. For if the opinion
        in question is admitted] it could be said that one merits grace by the
        deeds which he does after receiving grace. (2) Because it is against the
        nature of merit; for merit is the cause of reward, not as a final cause
        (for in this sense the reward is rather the cause of the merit), but
        rather by reduction to efficient causality, inasmuch as merit makes a
        man worthy of a reward and in this way disposes him for it. Now anything
        that is a cause in the line of efficiency can by no means be posterior
        in time to that of which it is the cause. It is impossible, then, for a
        person to merit what he already has. If in human affairs someone serves
        his master in return for a favor received, this is more of the nature of
        thanksgiving than of merit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The ability to merit is required both on the part of nature and on that
        of grace. It is required on the part of nature because no one can merit
        by his own act unless he has dominion over his act. If he has that
        dominion he can, as it were, give his act as a price for the reward. Now
        a man has dominion over his own acts through the power of free choice.
        The natural ability of free choice is therefore required for meriting.
        On the part of grace it is required because the reward of blessedness
        exceeds the capabilities of human nature, and so man is not able to
        merit it by his unaided natural powers. Grace by which he is enabled to
        merit is accordingly required.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now all these conditions for merit were fulfilled in Christ. He was
        lacking in some of the factors required for perfect blessedness:
        impassibility of soul and glory of body. By reason of this lack He was a
        wayfarer. There was in Him, moreover, the ability of nature by reason of
        His created will, and the ability of grace because of the fullness of
        grace. He was therefore able to merit.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Although in the line of moral conduct the soul of Christ was
        determined to one course of action, that is, good, it nevertheless was
        not determined to one in an unqualified sense; for it could perform this
        or that particular act or not perform it. He therefore retained the
        freedom which is required for meriting.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. He did not merit blessedness of soul, by reason of which He was a
        possessor, but only the blessedness of body and impassibility of soul.
        These were lacking to Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Christ did not merit anything not due Him in such a way that it
        became due, as men merit in their first meritorious act. Nor again did
        He merit in such a way that what was due Him should become more due, as
        occurs in those whose grace increases. But He merited in such a way that
        what was due Him in one way—by reason of grace—should become due Him in
        another way—by reason of merit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The glory of the body results from the glory of the soul when the
        soul is glorified in every respect, both in its relation to God and in
        its relation to the body. It was not in this way that the soul of Christ
        was glorified, but only in its relation to God. Inasmuch as it was the
        form of the body, it was passible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The souls of the saints in their heavenly home are entirely out of
        the state of wayfarers because they are already blessed both by
        enjoyment and by impassibility. The soul of Christ was not. There is
        therefore no parallel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. As far as charity itself is concerned, it is always a source of
        merit; but sometimes it is not in fact a source of merit because of the
        one who has it, since he is out of the state of meriting. This is seen
        in the saints in heaven. Christ, however, was not out of the state of
        meriting, because He was a wayfarer. By the same charity, accordingly,
        He both enjoyed and merited, as also by the same will. Yet the same
        thing was not both the source of merit and the reward, because He did
        not merit glory of soul, to which charity is relevant, but glory of
        body, as has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. That argument would prove something if it resulted from any defect on
        Christ’s part that He could not merit glory of soul. From what has
        already been said” it is clear that that is false.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Christ merited only inasmuch as He was a man. But other men cannot
        merit for others condignly. Then neither could Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Praise as well as merit depends upon an act of virtue. Now no one is
        praised for the act of someone else but only for his own. Then neither
        is the act of someone else imputed to anyone for his merit. Christ’s
        acts are accordingly not meritorious for others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Because He holds the primacy in the Church, Christ is the Church’s
        head, as is made clear in the Epistle to the Colossians (1:18). But
        other prelates who have the primacy in the Church cannot merit for their
        subjects. Then neither could Christ do so.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. In itself Christ’s merit is related in the same way to all men. If,
        then, Christ merited salvation for anyone, He merited it for all. But
        the merit of Christ cannot be frustrated. All therefore obtain
        salvation. But that obviously is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Christ is the head not only of men but also of angels. But He did not
        merit for the angels. Then neither did He do so for men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. If Christ could merit for others, then any one of His acts was
        meritorious for us—and that means for our salvation. His passion was
        accordingly not necessary for our salvation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Where one means will get results it is superfluous to use two. But
        the grace which is given to man is sufficient for man to merit eternal
        life for himself. It would therefore be superfluous for Christ to have
        merited it for us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Christ merited for us either sufficiently or insufficiently. If
        sufficiently, then our merit is not required for our salvation. If
        insufficiently, then His grace was insufficient. But both of these
        alternatives are inadmissible. Christ therefore did not merit for us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Something necessary for glory is lacking to Christ’s members now as
        it was before His passion. Since He does not merit for us now, neither
        did He then.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Had Christ merited for us, our condition would have been changed by
        His merit. But the condition of man seems to be the same after Christ as
        it was before. Just as the devil could tempt but not force man before,
        so too now. As punishment was due to sinners, so too now. As meritorious
        works were required in the just, so too now. Christ therefore did not
        merit for us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. In the Psalms (61:13) it is written: “Thou wilt render to every man
        according to his works.” But this would not be so if the merits of
        Christ were imputed to us. Christ therefore did not merit for us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Reward is meted out in proportion to the root of merit. Now if
        Christ merited for us, the reward of glory will be given to each one of
        us in proportion to the quantity of Christ’s grace. But that clearly is
        false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. That which is given on the basis of merit is paid rather than
        gratuitously given. If, then, Christ merited justification for us, it
        seems that we are not gratuitously justified by God. Then grace will not
        be grace. Christ therefore did not merit anything for us.

        1. That Christ atoned for us is expressly said in the first Epistle of
        St. John (7:2): “He is the propitiation for our sins.” But there cannot
        be atonement without merit. Christ therefore merited for us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The head in a physical body works not only for itself but also for
        all the members. Now Christ is the head of His body, the Church. His
        activity was therefore meritorious for His members.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Christ and the Church are in a sense one person. On the basis of that
        unity He speaks in the name of the Church in the words of the Psalm
        (21:1): “ God, my God, look upon me,” as the Gloss brings out.
        Consequently Christ could likewise by reason of that same unity merit in
        the name of others.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A human action informed by grace has value for obtaining eternal life in
        two ways that correspond to the two respects in which man falls short of
        winning glory.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The first respect is the lack of dignity of the person. One who does not
        have charity, for example, is neither suited nor worthy to have eternal
        life. In this respect a human action is of value for winning eternal
        life to the extent that by it a certain dignity and aptness for winning
        glory is acquired. As an act of sin leads to a certain deformity of the
        soul, a meritorious act leads to the soul’s adornment and dignity. From
        this there arises merit that is called condign.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The other respect in which man falls short of winning glory is the
        interposition of an obstacle, with the result that a man who otherwise
        is worthy does not win glory. This is the debt of some penalty. A man
        who is justified, for example, is indebted to pay some temporal penalty.
        In this respect a human action is related to glory much like the price
        paid to free a man from a penalty due. Under this aspect the human
        action has the character of atonement.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In both of these respects Christ’s actions were more efficacious than
        those of other men. By the actions of other men only the one acting is
        made suited for the reception of glory, because one man cannot exercise
        a spiritual influence upon another. As a consequence one cannot merit
        grace or eternal life for another condignly. But Christ in His humanity
        could exercise spiritual influence upon other men. His actions could
        accordingly cause in others suitableness for the winning of glory. He
        could therefore merit condignly for others, just as He could exercise
        influence upon others, inasmuch as His humanity was “the instrument of
        His divinity,” as Damascene teaches.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the second respect also we can discover greater efficacy in Christ
        than in other men. Although one man can atone for another provided that
        the former is in the state of grace, he cannot atone for the whole
        nature, because the act of one mere man is not equal in value to the
        good of the whole nature. But the action of Christ, being that of God
        and man, had a dignity that made it worth as much as the good of the
        whole nature, and so could atone for that nature.
      </p>

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As man Christ is of greater dignity than other men. It is accordingly
        not necessary to ascribe to other men whatever belonged to Christ as
        man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. An act of virtue is praiseworthy in its relation to the agent, and so
        one man cannot be praised for the act of another. But it gets its
        meritoriousness from its relation to the end, for which a person can be
        made suited by the influence of Christ. Christ could therefore merit for
        us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Christ holds the primacy in the Church by His own power, but other
        prelates hold it inasmuch as they represent the person and take the
        place of Christ. Christ could therefore merit for the faithful as for
        His own members, but other prelates cannot do so.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Christ’s merit bears the same relation to all men in point of
        sufficiency, not in point of efficacy. This happens partly from men’s
        free choice, partly from divine election, through which the effect of
        Christ’s merits is mercifully bestowed upon some but by a just judgment
        is withdrawn from others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. just as it belongs to a wayfarer to merit, so no one can merit except
        for a wayfarer, because the one for whom anyone merits must be lacking
        in some point that falls within the scope of merit. Now angels are not
        wayfarers with reference to the essential reward, and so Christ did no1,
        merit for them in this respect. But they are in some sense wayfarers
        with reference to the accidental reward in so far as they minister to
        us. In this respect, then, Christ’s merit is of value to them as well.
        It is accordingly said in the Epistle to the Ephesians (1:10) that
        through Him are re-established all things that are in heaven and on
        earth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Although every one of Christ’s acts was meritorious for us, yet to
        give satisfaction for the debt of human nature, which was made liable to
        death by the divine sentence, as is seen in Genesis (2:17), He had to
        undergo death in the place of all.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The grace which is given to someone personally is sufficient for the
        needs of that person himself but not for paying the debt of the whole
        nature. This is evident in the case of the ancient patriarchs, who,
        though having grace, were unable because of the debt of the nature to
        arrive at glory. The merit and satisfaction of Christ was accordingly
        needed to remove that debt. Furthermore, personal grace was never given
        to anyone after the sin of the first man except through faith, either
        explicit or implicit, in the Mediator.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The merit of Christ is operative with sufficient efficacy as a
        universal cause of the salvation of men, but this cause must be applied
        to each by means of the sacraments and of informed faith, which works
        through love. Thus something else. besides Christ’s merit is needed for
        our salvation, though the merit of Christ is the cause of that other
        factor as well.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. [The answer to this difficulty is missing.]
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. After the passion of Christ the condition of mankind has been much
        changed, because, with the debt of human nature paid, men can fly
        unrestrained to their heavenly home. Moreover, the eternal punishment
        due for personal sins is remitted by means of faith in the passion of
        Christ; and the temporal punishment is reduced by the power of the keys,
        in which the passi6n of Christ is operative. Furthermore, the demons are
        kept in check by the power of Christ’s passion so that they cannot tempt
        us so violently, and many helps are given to the faithful for resisting
        temptation. Finally, as a result of Christ’s passion grace with which to
        merit is given in the sacraments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Christ and His members are one mystical person. Consequently the
        works of the head are in some sense the works of the members. Thus, when
        something is given us on account of Christ’s works, that is not opposed
        to the statement of the Psalms (61:13): “Thou wilt render to every man
        according to his works.” And yet Christ’s merits are of profit to us in
        such a way that through the sacraments they cause in us grace by which
        we are bestirred to meritorious works.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Christ’s merit is related to our reward as a first and remote cause.
        Our reward is therefore not commensurate to Christ’s merit but to that
        merit which is its proximate cause, which derives from the act of the
        one given the reward.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. The very fact that any one of us obtains the benefit of Christ’s
        merit is itself gratuitously conferred upon us by God. Consequently
        grace is not thereby deprived of its essence.

        It seems that He could not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Deliberation is required for merit. But deliberation takes time.
        Therefore in the first instant of its creation the soul of Christ could
        not merit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Not only merit but also demerit depends upon an act of free choice.
        But the angels could not sin in the first instant of their creation,
        because they would in that case have been evil at the very instant of
        their creation. But that is false. Then neither could the soul of Christ
        merit at the first instant of its creation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Whenever there are two movements of which one is subordinated to the
        other, it is impossible for both to come to an end at the same instant.
        But the creation of Christ’s soul and the motion of free choice are
        subordinated movements, because the motion of free choice presupposes
        its creation. It is therefore impossible for the motion of free choice
        to come to an end at the very instant at which creation comes to an end,
        as soon as the soul is created.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The answer was given that Christ’s soul was helped by grace to merit
        at its first instant.—On the contrary, no grace conferred upon a
        creature carries it beyond the limits of creaturehood. But it attaches
        to the soul inasmuch as it is a creature to be unable to have the motion
        of its free choice at the first instant in which it is, as is evident
        from the argument given. It therefore cannot be helped by grace to merit
        at its first instant.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Grace perfects the soul after the manner of a habit. Now since a
        habit presupposes a power, it does not confer upon the soul an
        unqualified ability to act which it otherwise would not have; it confers
        rather the ability to act in a given way in which it could not act
        without the habit. If, then, Christ’s soul in its own nature could not
        have the use of free choice at the first instant of its creation, it
        seems that grace did not confer upon it the ability to merit at its
        first instant.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. An instant has the same relation to time as a point to a line. But
        according to the Philosopher, when a being in motion makes use of one
        point as two, that is, as the beginning of one line and the end of
        another, there necessarily intervenes a period of repose, as is shown in
        a reciprocating motion. Now, since the instant it which Christ’s soul
        was created is taken as the end of creation and as the beginning of the
        motion of free choice, and so we use one instant as two, it therefore
        seems that time intervenes. Thus Christ’s soul did not merit at the
        first instant of its creation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Grace stands to the act of grace as nature to the act of nature. By
        transposition, then, nature stands to the act of grace as grace to the
        act of nature. But nature is not capable of an act of grace. Then
        neither is grace capable of an act of nature. Consequently Christ’s soul
        at the first instant of its conception could not have had through grace
        an act which is within its competence by nature, namely, to choose.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. A form has three acts: it gives being, it distinguishes, and it
        orients to an end. Now these acts are related in the same way as being,
        the one, and the good; for being results from the first act, one from
        the second, and good from the third. A thing is accordingly a being
        before it is oriented to an end. Now Christ’s soul was oriented to its
        end by a meritorious act. It is therefore not possible for it to have
        merited at the first instant of its creation at which it had being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Merit depends upon an act of virtue, which is brought to completion
        particularly by choice, as the Philosopher teaches. But Christ’s soul
        could not have had an act of choice at the first instant of its
        creation; for choice presupposes deliberation, since it is appetency for
        what has been previously deliberated, as is pointed out in the
        <i>Ethics.</i> But deliberation takes time, since it is an
        investigation. Christ’s soul could therefore not have merited at the
        first instant of its creation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Feebleness of our organs prevents the use of free choice, as is seen
        in newly born infants. But Christ assumed this feebleness, just as He
        did the rest of our weaknesses. The soul of Christ therefore did not
        merit at the first instant of its creation.

        1. At the very instant of His creation Christ was most perfect in soul.
        But a perfection which is actual as well as habitual is greater than one
        which is habitual only. There were therefore virtues in Christ not only
        habitually but also actually at the first instant of His creation. But
        the acts of the virtues are meritorious. Christ therefore merited at the
        first instant of His creation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. At the first instant of His creation Christ had enjoyment as a true
        possessor. But enjoyment is had by means of an act of charity. He
        accordingly had an act of charity at the first instant of His creation.
        But this act of charity was meritorious in Christ. Therefore we must
        conclude as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. It was said in answer that the act of charity was not meritorious
        unless accompanied by deliberation.—On the contrary, deliberation or
        counsel is not concerned “with the last end, but with the means to it,”
        as is brought out in the <i>Ethics</i>. But the movement of charity is
        meritorious particularly inasmuch as it tends to the last end. For this
        act to be meritorious it therefore does not have to involve any
        comparison or deliberation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. It was said that the motion to the last end is meritorious only in so
        far as the person relates it to the end. It thus involves a comparison,
        and that cannot take place in an instant.—On the contrary, the
        intellectual part of the soul is more powerful in its operation than the
        sensitive. But as soon as anyone senses, he senses that he is sensing.
        Consequently, as soon as the will is directed toward God there can be a
        reference of this motion to God Himself; and so this need not take place
        successively.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Whoever understands anything understands at the same time whatever
        belongs to its notion; as in understanding man we understand at the same
        time animal. But of two relative terms each is in the notion of the
        other. Then whoever understands one relative term at the same time
        understands the other. It is therefore possible for the mind at one and
        the same instant to relate the motion of charity to God, referring one
        to the other. Thus no time is needed in that act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Anselm says that whatever we understand to belong to perfection we
        must attribute entirely to Christ. But to have a perfect operation at
        the first instant of one’s creation belongs to perfection. We must
        therefore attribute it to Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. As regards the merit of His soul Christ had no room to advance. He
        would have had, however, if He had not merited at the first instant of
        His creation. Therefore.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The rational power in Christ was no less perfect than the natural
        power of any other creature. But some of the powers of other creatures
        can have their operation at the first instant at which they begin to be.
        A candle, for instance, at the very instant at which it is lighted
        lights up the air. Consequently Christ’s soul at the first instant of
        its creation had the act of its rational power, and so it could merit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Gregory says: “The love of God is not inert. If it exists, it does
        great deeds. If it ceases to do deeds, it is not love.” But Christ had
        perfect charity at the first instant of His creation. Some act of love
        was therefore present; and so He had merit at that instant.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Something posterior by nature cannot be prior in time, though it may
        perhaps be simultaneous. Now merit is prior to reward by nature; but at
        the first instant of His conception Christ had the reward, because He
        was a true possessor. He therefore had merit at least at the same
        instant.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On this question there are two opinions. Some” say that Christ did not
        have merit at the first instant of His conception, but began to merit
        immediately after the first instant. Others say that He did merit at the
        very first instant. This latter opinion is the one which seems to be the
        more reasonable. For we believe that any spiritual perfection which any
        other creature can possibly have was conferred in its entirety upon the
        soul of Christ at the first instant of its creation. Now the
        impossibility of meriting at a given instant could come from either of
        two sources: (1) from the agent, or (2) from the act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This could come from the agent because of a lack of either of two
        capabilities. One is gratuitous. We might, for example, say that in the
        instant in which someone sins mortally, he cannot merit because he does
        not have grace. Again it could be because of the lack of a natural
        capability, as a child at the first instant at which it is conceived
        cannot merit because it does not have the use of free choice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now neither of these reasons is applicable in the matter at hand. For at
        His first instant Christ had the capability of grace, being full of
        grace, and also the capability of nature, having the full use of free
        choice; otherwise He could not have been a possessor. Consequently no
        impossibility of meriting at the first instant of His conception came
        from Christ, the agent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Similarly no such impossibility came from the meritorious act either.
        That a given act could not be performed at a given instant could come
        about in two ways: (1) Because that act involves successiveness and so
        cannot be completed in an instant. Thus local motion cannot take place
        in an instant. (2) Because the act presupposes certain conditions that
        cannot precede a definite instant. Thus, if a fire has been kindled out
        of its proper place, it is impossible for that fire to be in its proper
        place at the first instant at which it comes into existence, because
        motion is a prerequisite, and that motion cannot be before the first
        instant of its existence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now in neither of these two ways was Christ prevented from meriting at
        His first instant. Not in the first, because the motion of free choice
        upon which merit depends is not successive but simple and instantaneous.
        Not in the second, because nothing is prerequisite for the motion of the
        will except the act of the apprehensive power; and that motion is at the
        same instant as the act of the will, because the apprehended good moves
        the will; for the mover moves and the being in motion is moved at the
        same time and with the same motion. In Christ, moreover, the
        apprehension of the good does not need any previous inquiry in order to
        reach a certain judgment about the good, because Christ immediately had
        a true judgment about everything with certitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is evident, then, that there was nothing to keep Christ from meriting
        at the first instant. It must therefore be granted that at the first
        instant of His conception He merited.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The term deliberation can imply either of two meanings. The first is
        the perception by reason in a certain judgment of the matter about which
        the deliberation is being carried on. From this point of view it can
        take place in an instant in one devoid of any perplexity about what is
        to be done. In this sense deliberation found place in Christ. The term
        can also mean an inquiry or investigation. Then it implies a discourse
        and cannot take place in an instant. Christ needed no such deliberation,
        because He was not in doubt about what was to be done.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The will of a rational nature is naturally oriented to good, not to
        evil. It can accordingly at the first instant of its creation, unless
        prevented, be attracted to good, but not to evil; for it is attracted to
        evil only through an error which occurs in comparing and investigating.
        Time for comparing is accordingly needed for evil, but not for good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That argument is valid for successive but not for instantaneous
        movements. The reason for this is that, when two movements are in
        sequence, the same instant which is the end of the first movement can be
        the beginning of the second. Thus at the same instant at which the
        coming into existence of fire is completed outside its natural place,
        the local motion of the fire begins, unless there is some impediment,
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If the beginning of the second movement and the end of the same movement
        are the same, as happens in the instantaneous movements, then the end of
        the second movement occurs at the same instant as the end of the first.
        Illumination and vision, for example, terminate at the same instant. But
        if the end of the second movement Cannot be same instant with the
        beginning of that movement, as happens in all successive movements, then
        it will be impossible for the end of the second movement to be at the
        same instant as the end of the first movement. Now since the motion of
        fret choice is instantaneous, nothing prevents its end from being at the
        same instant as the end of the creation of Christ’s soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The answer to this is clear from what has just been said, for it is
        not beyond the capabilities of a creature that its instantaneous
        movement should be completed at the first instant.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Although the rational power can have its operation at the first
        instant of its creation as far as it is concerned, yet, if it is taken
        as coupled with an organ which is not yet suited to a perfection, it is
        prevented by the defect of the organ from being able to have its
        operation at that time. But that obstacle was removed from Christ’s soul
        by grace. On this score it enjoyed through grace the ability to act at
        its first instant.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. An instant in time and a point in space are not alike as regards the
        matter at hand. For a being in motion cannot use as two the same point
        in space except in the same species of motion; but a being in motion can
        use as two the same instant of time even as regards different species of
        motion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the same species of motion it is not possible to have continuity of
        motion if one movement actually ends and the other actually begins,
        because in this case repose intervenes, and consequently a time. In
        specifically different motions, however, it is possible for the end of
        one movement and the beginning of another to coincide, because between
        them no continuity or order is needed since both can exist together. For
        instance, while a thing is being moved it can at the same time be
        whitened, and at the instant at which it begins to become white the
        local motion ends. Between the parts of the same motion, however, there
        sometimes is an order, with the result that the two parts cannot exist
        together. In that case the end of one part does not coincide with the be
        inning of the other part if both are taken as actual. It is evident,
        then, that the use of one instant as two does not demand an intervening
        time, as does the use of one point as two in local motion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Since grace perfects nature it does not have the same relation to
        nature as nature to grace. When a proportion is transposed it does not
        hold good in all matters but only in continuous and discrete measures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. That argument holds for the order of nature, not for the order of
        time. This is clearly shown from the fact that at the very same instant
        the form gives being, orients, and distinguishes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Deliberation is required for choice when the person is not certain in
        regard to the things to be done. But that does not apply to Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Christ did not assume any defects that could result in the
        imperfection of grace and of knowledge. Such a defect is the
        unsuitability of one’s organs for the activity of the soul. Christ
        therefore did not assume this defect, but His organs were strengthened
        by grace so that they were suited for the operation of the soul, as
        would perhaps also have happened in the state of innocence.

        We concede these arguments because they arrive at true conclusions even
