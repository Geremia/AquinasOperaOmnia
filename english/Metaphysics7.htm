        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapters 1 & 2: 1028a 10-1028b 32
      </p>
      <p>
        560. The term being is used in many senses, as we have explained in our
        discussions on the different meanings of words (435). For in one sense
        it signifies the whatness of a thing and this particular thing; and in
        another sense it signifies of what sort a thing is or how much or any
        one of the other things which are predicated in this way. But of all the
        senses in which being is used, it is evident that the first of these is
        the whatness of a thing, which indicates substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        561. For when we state of what sort a thing is, we say that it is good
        or evil, and not that it is three cubits long or a man; but when we
        state what a thing is, we do not say that it is white or black or three
        cubits long, but that it is a man or a god. And other things are called
        beings because they belong to such a being; for some are qualities of
        it, others quantities, others affections, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        562. Hence one may even be puzzled whether each of the following terms,
        namely, to walk, to be healthy and to sit, is a being or a non-being.
        And it is similar in the case of other things such as these; for no one
        of them is fitted by nature to exist of itself or is capable of existing
        apart from substance. But if anything is a being, it is rather the thing
        that walks and sits and is healthy. Now these appear to be beings to a
        greater degree because there is some subject which underlies them; and
        this is substance and the individual, which appears in a definite
        category; for the term good or sitting is not used without this.
        Evidently then it is by reason of this that each of the other categories
        is a being. Hence the first kind of being, and not being of a special
        sort but being in an unqualified sense, will be substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        563. Now there are several senses in which a thing is said to be first;
        but substance is first in every respect: in definition, in the order of
        knowing, and in time; for none of the other categories can exist
        separately, but only substance. And it is first in definition, because
        in the definition of each thing it is necessary to include the
        definition of substance. And we think that we know each thing best when
        we know what it is (for example, what a man is or what fire is) rather
        than when we know of what sort it is or how much it is or where it is;
        for we know each of these things only when we know what the quality or
        quantity is.
      </p>
      <p>
        564. And the question which was raised formerly and is raised now and
        always, and which always causes difficulty, is what being is; and this
        is the question what substance is. For some say that it is one, and
        others more than one; and some say that it is limited, and others
        unlimited. And for this reason we must investigate chiefly and primarily
        and solely, as we might say, what this kind of being is.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">Chapter 2</p>
      <p>
        565. Now it seems that substance is found most evidently in bodies.
        Hence we say that animals and plants and their parts are substances, and
        also natural bodies, such as fire, water, earth and particular things of
        this kind, and all things which are either parts of these or composed of
        these, either of parts or of all, for example, the heaven and its parts,
        such as the stars, the moon and the sun. But whether these alone are
        substances, or other things also are, or none of these but certain other
        things, must be investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
        566. Again, it seems to some that the limits of a body, such as surface,
        line, point and unit, are substances to a greater degree than a body or
        solid. And some are of the opinion that there is nothing of this sort
        apart from sensible substances, while others think that there are
        eternal substances which are more numerous and possess being to a
        greater degree. Thus Plato claimed that there are two kinds of
        substances: the separate Forms and the objects of mathematics, and a
        third kind: the substances of sensible bodies. And Speusippus admitted
        still more kinds of substances, beginning with the unit; and he posited
        principles for each kind of substance: one for numbers, another for
        continuous quantities, and still another for the soul; and by proceeding
        in this way he increases the kinds of substance. And some say that the
        separate Forms and numbers have the same nature, and that other things,
        such as lines and surfaces, depend on these; and so on until one comes
        to the substance of the heavens and sensible bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        567. Regarding these matters, then, it is necessary to investigate which
        statements are true and which are not; and what things are substances;
        and whether there are or are not any ‘substances in addition to sensible
        ones; and how these exist; and whether there is any separable substance
        (and if so, why and how), or whether there is no such substance apart
        from sensible ones. This must be done after we have first described what
        substance is.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1245. Having dismissed both accidental being and being which signifies
        the true from the principal study of this science, here the Philosopher
        begins to establish the truth about essential being (<i>ens per se</i>),
        which exists outside the mind and constitutes the principal object of
        study in this science. This is divided into two parts; for this science
        discusses both being as being and the first principles of being, as has
        been stated in Book VI (532:C 1145). Thus in the first part (560:C 1245)
        he establishes the truth about being; and in the second (1023:C 2-416),
        about the first principles of being. He does this in Book XII (“The
        study”).
      </p>
      <p>
        But since being and unity accompany each other and come within the scope
        of the same study, as has been stated at the beginning of Book IV (301:C
        548), the first part is therefore divided into two sections. In the
        first he establishes the truth about being as being; and in the second
        (814:C 1920), about unity and those attributes which naturally accompany
        it. He does this in Book X (“It was pointed out”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now essential being, which exists outside the mind, is divided in two
        ways, as has been stated in Book V (437:C 889); for it is divided,
        first, into the ten categories, and second, into the potential and the
        actual. Accordingly, the first part is divided into two sections. In the
        first he establishes the truth about being as divided into the ten
        categories; and in the second (742:C 1768), about being as divided into
        the potential and the actual. He does this in Book IX (“We have dealt”).
      </p>
      <p>
        1246. The first part is divided again into two sections. In the first he
        shows that in order to establish the truth about being as divided into
        the ten categories, it is necessary to establish the truth about
        substance; and in the second (568:C 1270), he begins to do this (“The
        term substance”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First (560:C 1247), he shows
        that it is necessary to settle the issue about substance. Second (565:C
        1263), he indicates the things that have to be discussed about substance
        (“Now it seems”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. He shows that one who intends
        to treat being should investigate substances separately; and he does
        this, first, by giving an argument; and second (564:C 1260), by
        considering what others have been accustomed to do (“And the question”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence in the first part his aim is to give the following argument. That
        which is the first among the kinds of being, since it is being in an
        unqualified sense and not being with some qualification, clearly
        indicates the nature of being. But substance is being of this kind.
        Therefore to know the nature of being it suffices to establish the truth
        about substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows that
        substance is the first kind of being; and second (563:C 1257), he shows
        in what way it is said to be first (“Now there are several”). In regard
        to the first he does two things.
      </p>
      <p><i>Metaphysics is about substance</i></p>
      <p>
        1247. First, he explains his thesis. He says that the term being is used
        in many senses (as has been stated in Book V (885) where he
        distinguished the different senses in which terms of this kind are
        used); for (1) in one sense being signifies (a) the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">whatness</span> of a thing and (b)
        <span style="font-weight: bold">this particular</span> thing, i.e.,
        substance, inasmuch as by “the whatness of a thing” is meant the essence
        of a substance, and by “this particular thing,” an individual substance;
        and the different senses of substance are reduced to these two, as has
        been stated in Book V (440:C 898). And in another sense (2) it signifies
        quality or quantity or any one of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">other categories</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        And since being is used in many senses, it is evident that being in the
        primary sense is the whatness of a thing, i.e., the being which
        signifies <span style="font-weight: bold">substance</span>.
      </p>
      <p>1248. <b>For when we state</b> (561).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he proves his thesis by using the following
        <span style="font-weight: bold">argument</span>: in every class of
        things that which exists of itself and is a being in an unqualified
        sense is prior to that which exists by reason of something else and is a
        being in a qualified sense. But substance is a
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >being in an unqualified sense and exists of itself</span
        >, whereas all classes of beings other than substance are beings in a
        qualified sense and exist by reason of substance. Therefore substance is
        the primary kind of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        1249. He makes the minor premise clear in two ways. He does this, first,
        by considering the way in which we speak or make predications. He says
        that it is evident from this that substance is the primary kind of
        being, because when we state of what sort a thing is we say that it is
        either good or evil; for this signifies quality, which differs from
        substance and quantity. Now three cubits long signifies quantity and man
        signifies substance. Therefore when we state of what sort a thing is, we
        do not say that it is three cubits long or a man. And when we state what
        a thing is, we do not say that it is white or hot, which signify
        quality, or three cubits long, which signifies quantity, but we say that
        it is a man or a god, which signifies substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1250. From this it is clear that terms signifying substance express what
        a thing is in an unqualified sense, whereas those signifying quality do
        not express what a thing is in an unqualified sense, but what sort of
        thing it is. The same is true of quantity and the other genera.
      </p>
      <p>
        1251. From this it is clear that
        <span style="font-weight: bold">substance</span> itself is said to be
        <span style="font-weight: bold">a being of itself</span>, because terms
        which simply signify substance designate what this thing is.
      </p>
      <p>
        But other classes of things are said to be beings, not because they have
        a quiddity of themselves (as though they were beings of themselves,
        since they do not express what a thing is in an unqualified sense), but
        because “they belong to such a being,” i.e., because they have some
        connection with substance, which is a being of itself. For they do not
        signify quiddity, since some of them are clearly qualities of such a
        being, i.e., of substance, other quantities, other affections, or
        something of the sort signified by the other genera.
      </p>
      <p>1252. <b>Hence one may</b> (562).</p>
      <p>
        Second he proves the same point by means of an
        <span style="font-weight: bold">example</span>. The other kinds of
        beings are beings only inasmuch as they are related to substance.
        Therefore, since other beings when signified in the abstract do not
        designate any connection with substance, the question can arise whether
        they are beings or non-beings, for example, whether to walk, to be
        healthy, and to sit, and any one of these things which are signified in
        the abstract, is a being or a non-being. And it is similar in the case
        of other things such as these, which are signified in the abstract,
        whether they designate some activity, as the foregoing do, or whether
        they do not, as is the case with whiteness and blackness.
      </p>
      <p>
        1253. Now
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >accidents signified in the abstract</span
        >
        seem to be non-beings, because no one of them is fitted by nature to
        exist of itself. In fact the being of each of them consists in their
        existing in something else, and no one of them is capable of existing
        apart from substance. Therefore when they are signified in the abstract
        as though they were beings of themselves and separate from substance,
        they seem to be <span style="font-weight: bold">non-beings</span>. The
        reason is that words do not signify things directly according to the
        mode of being which they have in reality, but indirectly according to
        the mode in which we understand them; for concepts are the likenesses of
        things, and words the likenesses of concepts, as is stated in Book I of
        the <i>Peri hermenias</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        1254. Moreover, even though the mode of being which accidents have is
        not one whereby they may exist of themselves but only in something else,
        still
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >the intellect can understand them as though they existed of
          themselves</span
        >; for it is capable by nature of separating things which are united in
        reality. Hence abstract names of accidents signify beings which inhere
        in something else, although they do not signify them as inhering. And
        non-beings would be signified by names of this kind, granted that they
        would not inhere in something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        1255. Further, since these accidents signified in the abstract appear to
        be non-beings, it seems rather to be the concrete names of accidents
        that signify beings. And “if anything is a being,” it seems rather to be
        “the thing that walks and sits and is healthy,” because some subject is
        determined by them by reason of the very meaning of the term, inasmuch
        as they designate something connected with a subject. Now this subject
        is substance. Therefore every term of this kind which signifies an
        accident in the concrete “appears in a definite category,” i.e., it
        seems to involve the category of substance, not in such a way that the
        category of substance is a part of the meaning of such terms (for white
        in the categorical sense indicates quality alone), but so that terms of
        this sort signify accidents as inhering in a substance. And we do not
        use the terms “good or sitting without this,” i.e., without substance;
        for an accident signifies something connected with substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1256. Again, since accidents do not seem to be beings insofar as they
        are signified in themselves, but only insofar as they are signified in
        connection with substance, evidently it is by reason of this that each
        of the other beings is a being. And from this it also appears that
        substance is “the first kind of being and being in an unqualified sense
        and not being of a special sort,” i.e., with some qualification, as is
        the case with accidents; for to be white is not to be in an unqualified
        sense but with some qualification. This is clear from the fact that when
        a thing begins to be white we do not say that it begins to be in an
        unqualified sense, but that it begins to be white. For when Socrates
        begins to be a man, he is said to begin to be in an unqualified sense.
        Hence it is obvious that being a man signifies being in an unqualified
        sense, but that being white signifies being with some qualification.
      </p>
      <p>1257. <b>Now there are several</b> (563).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows in what respect substance is said to be first. He says
        that, since the term first is used in several senses, as has been
        explained in Book V (936), then <i>substance</i> is the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">first of all beings</span> in three
        respects: in the order of (1) knowing, in (2) definition, and in (3)
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) He proves that it is first in
        <span style="font-weight: bold">time</span> by this argument: none of
        the other categories is capable of existing apart from substance, but
        substance alone is capable of existing apart from the others; for no
        accident is found without a substance, but some substance is found
        without an accident. Thus it is clear that an accident does not exist
        whenever a substance does, but the reverse is true; and for this reason
        substance is prior in time.
      </p>
      <p>
        1258. (2) It is also evident that it is first in
        <span style="font-weight: bold">definition</span>, because in the
        definition of any accident it is necessary to include the definition of
        substance; for just as nose is given in the definition of snub, so too
        the proper subject of any accident is given in the definition of that
        accident. Hence just as animal is prior to man in definition, because
        the definition of animal is given in that of man, in a similar fashion
        substance is prior to accidents in definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        1259. (1) It is evident too that substance is first in the order of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">knowing</span>, for that is first in the
        order of knowing which is better known and explains a thing better. Now
        each thing is better known when its substance is known rather than when
        its quality or quantity is known; for we think we know each thing best
        when we know what man is or what fire is, rather than when we know of
        what sort it is or how much it is or where it is or when we know it
        according to any of the other categories. For this reason too we think
        that we know each of the things contained in the categories of accidents
        when we know what each is; for example, when we know what being this
        sort of thing is, we know quality; and when we know what being how much
        is, we know quantity. For just as the other categories have being only
        insofar as they inhere in a substance, in a similar way they can be
        known only insofar as they share to some extent in the mode according to
        which substance is known, and this is to know the whatness of a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        1260. <span style="font-weight: bold">And the question</span> (564).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he proves the same point, namely, that it is necessary to treat
        substance separately, by considering what other philosophers have been
        accustomed to do. He says that when one raises the question what being
        is (and this is a question which has always caused difficulty for
        philosophers both “formerly,” i.e., in the past, and “now,” i.e., in the
        present), this is nothing else than the question or problem what the
        substance of things is.
      </p>
      <p>
        1261. For some men, such as Parmenides (65:C 138) and Melissus (65:C
        140), said that “this being,” i.e., substance, is one and immobile,
        whereas others, such as the ancient philosophers of nature, who
        maintained (67:C 145) that there is only one material principle of
        things, said that it is mobile. And they thought that matter alone is
        being and substance. Hence when they claimed that there is one being
        because there is one material principle, they obviously understood by
        one being, one substance. Other men maintained that there are more
        beings than one, namely, those who posited (67:C 145) many material
        principles, and consequently, many substances of things. And some of
        this group held that these principles are limited in number, for
        example, Empedocles, who posited (68:C 148) four elements; and others
        held that they are unlimited in number, for example, Anaxagoras, who
        posited (44:C go) an unlimited number of like parts, and Democritus, who
        posited (55:C 113) an unlimited number of indivisible bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        1262. If, then, the other philosophers in treating of beings paid
        attention to substances alone, we too should investigate “what this kind
        of being is,” i.e., what substance itself is. And this we must do, I
        say, chiefly, because this is our principal aim; and primarily, because
        by means of it the other kinds of being are known; and solely, as we
        might say, because by establishing what is true about substance by
        itself, one acquires a knowledge of all the other kinds of being. Thus
        in one sense he deals with substance separately, and in another sense
        not. He indicates this when he says “as we might say” or inasmuch as we
        might speak in this way, as we are accustomed to say of things which are
        not true in every respect.
      </p>
      <p>1263. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now it seems</span> (565).</p>
      <p>
        Here he indicates the things that have to be discussed about substance;
        and in regard to this he does two things. First (565:C 1263), he gives
        the opinions that other men have held about substance. Second (567:C
        1268), he states that it is necessary to determine which of their
        opinions are true (“Regarding these matters”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First (565), he indicates the
        things that are evident about substance. He says that substantial being
        is found most obviously in bodies. Thus we say that animals and plants
        and their parts are substances, and also natural bodies such as fire,
        earth, water, “and particular things of this kind,” i.e., such elemental
        bodies as earth and fire, according to the opinion of Heraclitus (42:C
        87), and other intermediate entities, according to the opinions of
        others. We also say that all parts of the elements are substances, as
        well as the bodies composed of the elements, whether of some of the
        elements, as particular compounds, or “of all the elements,” i.e., the
        whole of the various elements, as this whole sphere of active and
        passive beings; and as we also say that “a heaven,” which is a natural
        body distinct from the elements, is a substance, and also its parts,
        such as the stars, the moon and the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        1264. But whether these sensible substances are the only substances, as
        the ancient philosophers of nature claimed, or whether there are also
        some substances which differ from these, as the Platonists claimed, or
        whether these too are not substances but only certain things which
        differ from these, must be investigated.
      </p>
      <p>1265. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, it seems</span> (566).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he describes the philosophers’ opinions about those substances
        which are not evident. He says that it seems to some philosophers that
        the limits of bodies are the substances of things, i.e., that surface,
        line, point and unit are substances to a greater degree than a body or
        solid. And those who held this opinion differed in their views; because
        some, the Pythagoreans, thought that no limits of this kind are separate
        from sensible bodies, while others thought that there are certain
        eternal beings which are separate from and more numerous than sensible
        things and have being to a greater degree. I say “have being to a
        greater degree,” because they are incorruptible and immobile, whereas
        sensible bodies are corruptible and mobile; and “more numerous,” because
        while sensible bodies belong only to one order, these separate beings
        belong to two, inasmuch as “Plato claimed that there are two kinds of
        separate substances,” or two orders of separate substances, namely, the
        separate Forms or Ideas and the objects of mathematics; and he also
        posited a third order—the substances of sensible bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        1266. But Speusippus, who was Plato’s nephew and his successor, posited
        many orders of substances, and in each order he also began with the
        unit, which he posited as the principle in each order of substance. But
        he posited one kind of unit as the principle of numbers, which he
        claimed to be the first substances after the Forms, and another as the
        principle of continuous quantities, which he claimed to be second
        substances; and finally he posited the substance of the soul. Hence by
        proceeding in this way he extended the order of substances right down to
        corruptible bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        1267. But some thinkers differed from Plato and Speusippus, because they
        did not distinguish between the Forms and the first order of
        mathematical objects, which is that of numbers. For they said that the
        Forms and numbers have the same nature, and that “all other things
        depend on these,” i.e., are related successively to numbers, namely,
        lines and surfaces, right down to the first substance of the heavens and
        the other sensible bodies which belong to this last order.
      </p>
      <p>
        1268.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Regarding these matters</span> (567).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he explains what should be said about the foregoing opinions. He
        says that it is necessary to determine which of the above opinions are
        true and which are not; and what things are substances; and whether the
        objects of mathematics and the separate Forms are substances in addition
        to sensible ones, or not; and if they are substances, what mode of being
        they have; and if they are not substances in addition to sensible ones,
        whether there is any other separate substance, and [if so], why and how;
        or whether there is no substance in addition to sensible substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        1269. For he will settle this issue below and in Book XII (1055:C 2488)
        of this work. Yet before this is done it is first necessary to posit and
        explain what it is that constitutes the substance of these sensible
        bodies in which substance is clearly found. He does this in the present
        book (568:C 1270) and in Book VIII (696:C 1687), which follows.<br /></p

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapters 3 & 4: 1028b 33-1029b 12
      </p>
      <p>
        568. The term substance is used chiefly of four things, if not of more;
        for the essence (or quiddity) and the universal and the genus seem to be
        the substance of each thing, and fourthly the subject. Now the subject
        is that of which the others are predicated, while it itself is not
        predicated of anything else. And for this reason it is first necessary
        to establish the truth about this, because this first subject seems in
        the truest sense to be substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        569. Now in one sense matter is said to be the subject, and in another,
        the form, and in still another, the thing composed of these. By matter I
        mean the bronze, and by form the specifying figure, and by the thing
        composed of these the whole statue.
      </p>
      <p>
        570. If, then, the specifying principle is prior to the matter and is
        being to a greater degree, for the same reason it will also be prior to
        the thing composed of these. We have now sketched what substance is,
        namely, that it is not what is predicated of a subject, but that of
        which all other things are predicated. However, it must not be
        considered merely in this way; for this is not enough, since this is
        evident.
      </p>
      <p>
        571. And from this point of view matter is substance; for if it is not,
        it eludes us to say what else is. For when everything else is taken
        away, nothing but matter appears to remain, because the other things are
        affections, activities and potencies of bodies. And length, width and
        depth are quantities and not substances; for quantity is not substance,
        but substance is rather the first thing to which these belong. But when
        length, width and depth are taken away, we see that nothing remains
        unless there is something which is limited by them. Hence to those who
        consider the situation in this way, matter alone must seem to be
        substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        572. And by matter I mean that which in itself is neither a quiddity nor
        a quantity nor anything expressed by any of the other categories by
        which being is made determinate. For there is something of which each of
        these is predicated, whose being is different from that of each of the
        other categories, because the others are predicated of substance, but
        this is predicated of matter. Therefore the ultimate subject is in
        itself neither a quiddity nor a quantity nor anything else. Nor again is
        it the negations of these, for they too will be accidental to it.
        Therefore for those who ponder the question it follows from these
        arguments that matter is substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        573. But this is impossible; for to exist separately and to be a
        particular thing scern to belong chiefly to substance; and for this
        reason it would seem that the specifying principle and the thing
        composed of both the specifying principle and matter are substancc to a
        greater dcgrec than matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        574. Yet that substance which is now composed of both (I mean of form
        and matter) must be dismissed; for it is subsequent and open to view.
        And matter too is in a sense evident. But it is necessary to investigate
        the third kind of substance, for this is the most perplexing.
      </p>
      <p>
        575. Now some admit that among sensible things there are substances, and
        therefore these must be investigated first.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">Chapter 4</p>
      <p>
        576. Since we have established at the very beginning (568) the different
        senses into which we have divided the term substance, and that one of
        these seems to be the essence of a thing, this must be investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
        577. For this is a preparatory task in order that one may pass to what
        is more knowable, because learning is acquired by all in this way, by
        proceeding from things which are less knowable by nature to those which
        are more knowable. And just as in practical matters one’s task is to
        proceed from things which are good for each individual to those which
        are totally good and good for each, in a similar fashion our task now is
        to proceed from things which are more knowable to us to those which are
        more knowable by nature. But what is knowable and first to individual
        men is often only slightly knowable and has little or nothing of being.
        Yet starting from what is only slightly knowable but knowable to
        oneself, we must try to acquire knowledge of things which are wholly
        knowable, by proceeding, as has been said, by way of the very things
        which are knowable to us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Different meanings of substance</i></p>
      <p>
        1270. Having shown that the chief aim of this science is to study
        substance, he now begins to establish the truth about substance. This
        part is divided into two members. In the first (1270) he explains the
        method and order to be followed in treating of substance. In the second
        (1306), he goes ahead with his treatment of substance (“And first let us
        make”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He explains the method and order to be followed in treating of substance
        by distinguishing its different senses; and by explaining which of these
        senses must be dealt with primarily and principally, which of them must
        be omitted, and which must be considered to be prior or subsequent.
        Hence the first part is divided into three members, according to the
        divisions and subdivisions of substance which he gives. This second part
        (1276) begins where he says, “Now in one sense.” The third (1297) begins
        where he says, “Now some.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly he says, first, that the term substance is used at least of
        four things, if not “of more,” i.e., in more senses. For there are
        several senses in which some speak of substance, as is clear in the case
        of those who said that the limits of bodies are substances, which sense
        he dismisses here.
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) Now the first of these senses is that in which a thing’s
        <span style="font-weight: bold">essence</span>, i.e., its quiddity,
        essential structure, or nature, is called its substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1271. (2) The second sense is that in which “the universal” is called
        the substance of a thing, according to the opinion of those who maintain
        that the Ideas are separate Forms, which are the universals predicated
        of particular things and the substances of these particular things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1272. (3) The third sense is that in which “the first genus seems to be
        the substance of each thing”; and in this sense they claim that unity
        and being are the substances of all things and their first genera.
      </p>
      <p>
        1273. (4) The fourth sense is that in which “the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">subject</span>,” i.e., a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">particular</span> substance, is called a
        substance. Now a subject means that of which other things are
        predicated, either as superiors are predicated of inferiors, for
        example, genera, species and differences; or as common and proper
        accidents are predicated of a subject, for example, as man, animal,
        rational, capable of laughter and white are predicated of Socrates.
        However, a subject is not itself predicated of anything else, and this
        must be understood essentially. For nothing prevents Socrates from being
        predicated accidentally of this white thing or of animal or of man,
        because Socrates is the thing of which white or animal or man is an
        accident. For it is evident that the subject which is spoken of here is
        what is called first substance in the <i>Categories</i>, for the
        definition of subject given here and that of first substance given there
        are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        1274. Hence he concludes that it is necessary to establish the truth
        “about this,” i.e., about this subject or
        <span style="font-weight: bold">first substance</span>, because such a
        subject seems in the truest sense to be substance. Therefore in the
        <i>Categories</i> it is said that such substance is said to be substance
        properly, principally and chiefly. For substances of this kind are by
        their very nature the subjects of all other things, namely, of species,
        genera and accidents; whereas
        <span style="font-weight: bold">second substance</span>, i.e., genera
        and species, are the subjects of accidents alone. And they also have
        this nature only by reason of these first substances; for man is white
        inasmuch as this man is white.
      </p>
      <p>
        1275. Hence it is evident that the division of substance given here is
        almost the same as that given in the <i>Categories</i>, for by subject
        here is understood first substance. And what he called the genus and the
        universal, which seem to pertain to genus and species, are contained
        under second substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the <span style="font-weight: bold">essence</span>, which is
        given here, is omitted in that work, because it belongs in the
        predicamental order only as a principle; for it is neither a (~) genus
        nor a (~) species nor (~) an individual thing, but is (+) the formal
        principle of all these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1276. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now in one sense</span> (569).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he subdivides the fourth sense of substance given in his original
        division, i.e., substance in the sense of a subject; and in regard to
        this he does three things. First, he gives this subdivision. Second
        (570:C 1278) he compares the parts of this subdivision with each other
        (“If, then”). Third (574:C 1294), he shows how the parts of this
        division must be treated (“Yet that substance”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly he says, first (569), that a subject in the sense of a first
        or particular substance is divided into three parts, i.e., into matter,
        form, and the thing composed of these. This division is not one of genus
        into species, but of an analogous predicate, which is predicated in a
        primary and in a derivative sense of those things which are contained
        under it. For both the composite and the matter and the form are called
        particular substances, but not in the same order; and therefore later on
        (573:C 1291) he inquires which of these has priority as substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1277. To clarify this part of his division he draws an example from the
        field of artifacts, saying that bronze is as matter, the figure as “the
        specifying form,” i.e., the principle which gives a thing its species,
        and the statue as the thing composed of these. This example must not be
        understood to express the situation as it really is but only according
        to a proportional likeness; for figure and other forms produced by art
        are not substances but accidents. But since figure is related to bronze
        in the realm of artifacts as substantial form is to matter in the realm
        of natural bodies, he uses this example insofar as it explains what is
        unknown by means of what is evident.
      </p>
      <p>1278. <span style="font-weight: bold">If, then</span> (570).</p>
      <p>
        Here he compares the parts of the foregoing division with each other;
        and in regard to this he does three things. First (570), he explains
        that the form is substance to a greater degree than the composite.
        Second (571:C 1281), he explains that some men were of the opinion that
        matter constitutes substance in the truest sense (“And from this”).
        Third (573:C 1291), he shows that the form and the composite are
        substance to a greater degree than matter (“But this is impossible”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (570), “that the specifying principle,” i.e.,
        the form, is prior to matter. For matter is a potential being, and the
        specifying principle is its actuality; and actuality is prior to
        potentiality in nature. And absolutely speaking it is prior in time,
        because the potential is brought to actuality only by means of something
        actual; although in one and the same subject which is at one time
        potential and at another actual, potentiality is prior to actuality in
        time. Hence it is clear that form is prior to matter, and that it is
        also a being to a greater degree than matter; because that by reason of
        which anything is such, is more so, But matter becomes an actual being
        only by means of form. Hence form must be being to a greater degree than
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1279. And from this it again follows for the same reason that form is
        prior to the thing composed of both, inasmuch as there is something
        having the nature of matter in the composite. Thus the composite shares
        in something which is secondary in nature, i.e., in matter. And it is
        also clear that matter and form are principles of the composite. Now the
        principles of a thing are prior to that thing. Therefore, if form is
        prior to matter, it will be prior to the composite.
      </p>
      <p>
        1280. And since it might seem to someone, from the fact that the
        Philosopher gives all the senses in which the term substance is used,
        that this suffices for a knowledge of what substance is, he therefore
        adds that “we have now merely sketched” what substance is; i.e., stated
        only in a universal way that substance is not what is predicated of a
        subject, but that of which other things are predicated. But one must not
        merely understand substance and other things in this way, namely, by
        means of a universal and logical definition; for this is not a
        sufficient basis for knowing the nature of a thing, because the very
        formula which is given for such a definition is evident. For the
        principles of a thing, on which the knowledge of a thing depends, are
        not mentioned in a definition of this kind, but only some common
        condition of a thing by means of which such acquaintance is imparted.
      </p>
      <p>
        1281. <span style="font-weight: bold">And from this point</span> (571).
      </p>
      <p>
        He examines the view that matter is in the truest sense substance; and
        in regard to this he does two things. First (571), he gives the argument
        by which the ancient philosophers maintained that matter most truly and
        solely is substance. Second (572:C 1285), he explains what matter is
        (“And by matter”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence he says, first, that not only the form and the composite are
        substance but so also is matter, according to the argument mentioned
        above, for if matter itself is not substance, it eludes us to say what
        other thing besides matter is substance. For if the other attributes,
        which clearly are not substance, are taken away from sensible bodies, in
        which substance is clearly apparent, it seems that the only thing which
        remains is matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1282. For in these sensible bodies, which all men admit to be
        substances, there are certain attributes such as the affections of
        bodies, for example, hot and cold and the like, which are evidently not
        substances. And in these bodies there are also “certain activities,”
        i.e., processes of generation and corruption and motions, which are
        clearly not substances. And in them there are also potencies, which are
        the principles of these activities and motions, i.e., potencies of
        acting and being acted upon, which are present in things; and it is also
        clear that these are not substances, but that they rather belong to the
        genus of quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        1283. And, after all of these, we find dimensions in sensible bodies,
        namely, length, width and depth, which are quantities and not
        substances. For it is evident that quantity is not substance, but that
        substance is that to which the foregoing dimensions belong as their
        first subject. But when these dimensions are taken away, nothing seems
        to remain except their subject, which is limited and differentiated by
        dimensions of this kind. And this subject is matter; for dimensive
        quantity seems to belong immediately to matter, since matter is divided
        in such a way as to receive different forms in its different parts only
        by means of this kind of quantity. Therefore, from a consideration of
        this kind it seems to follow not only that matter is substance, but that
        it alone is substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1284. Now it was their ignorance of substantial form that misled the
        ancient philosophers into giving this argument; for as yet they had not
        progressed in knowledge to the point where their mind might be elevated
        to something over and above sensible bodies. Hence they considered only
        those forms which are proper or common sensibles; and it is clear that
        such attributes as white and black, great and small, and the like, are
        accidents of this kind. But a substantial form is perceptible only
        indirectly, and therefore they did not acquire g knowledge of it so that
        they might know how to distinguish it from matter. In fact they said
        that the whole subject, which we maintain is composed of matter and
        form, is first matter, for example, air or water or something of the
        kind. And they called those things forms which we call accidents, for
        example, quantities and qualities, whose Proper subject is not first
        matter but the composite substance, which is an actual substance; for it
        is by reason of this that every accident is something inhering in a
        substance, as has been explained (562:C 1254-56).
      </p>
      <p>
        1285. <span style="font-weight: bold">And by matter I mean</span> (572).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now since the foregoing argument which shows that matter alone is
        substance seems to have come from their ignorance of matter, as has been
        pointed out, be therefore next states what matter really is, as is made
        clear in Book I of the <i>Physics</i>. For matter can be adequately
        known by itself only by means of motion, and the study of it seems to
        belong chiefly to the philosophy of nature. Hence the Philosopher also
        accepts here the characteristics of matter investigated in his physical
        treatises, saying that “by matter I mean that which in itself,” i.e.,
        considered essentially, “is neither a quiddity,” i.e., a substance, “nor
        a quantity nor any of the other categories into which being is divided
        or by which it is made determinate.”
      </p>
      <p>
        1286. This is especially evident in the case of motion; for, properly
        speaking, the subject of change and motion must differ from each of the
        limits of motion, as is proved in Book I of the <i>Physics</i>. Now
        matter is the first subject which underlies not only those motions which
        are qualitative and quantitative, and those which pertain to the other
        accidents, but also those which are substantial. Hence it must differ
        essentially from all substantial forms and their privations, which are
        the limits of generation and, corruption, and not just quantitatively or
        qualitatively or according to the other accidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        1287. Yet the Philosopher does not use motion to prove that matter
        differs from all forms (for this proof belongs to the philosophy of
        nature); but he uses the method of predication, which is proper to
        dialectics and is closely allied with this science, as he says in Book
        IV (311:C 574). Hence he says that there must be some subject of which
        all terms are predicated, yet in such a way that the being of that
        subject of which they are predicated differs from the being of each of
        the things which “are predicated of it”; i.e., they have a different
        quiddity or essence.
      </p>
      <p>
        1288. Now it must be noted that what has been said here cannot be
        understood to apply to univocal predication, according to which genera
        are predicated of the species in whose definitions they are given,
        because man and animal do not differ essentially; but this must be
        understood to apply to denominative predication, as when white is
        predicated of man, for the quiddity of white differs from that of man.
        Hence he adds that the other genera are predicated of substance in this
        way, i.e., denominatively, and that substance is predicated of matter
        denominatively.
      </p>
      <p>
        1289. It must not be understood, then, that actual substance (of which
        we are speaking here) is predicated of matter univocally or essentially;
        for he had already said above that matter is neither a quiddity nor any
        of the other categories. But it must be understood to be predicated
        denominatively, in the way in which accidents are predicated of
        substance. For just as the proposition “Man is white” is true, and the
        proposition “Man is whiteness” or “Humanity is whiteness” is not, in a
        similar way the proposition “This material thing is a man” is true, and
        the proposition “Matter is man” or “Matter is humanity” is not.
        Concretive or denominative predication, then, shows that, just as
        substance differs essentially from accidents, in a similar fashion
        matter differs essentially from substantial forms. Hence it follows that
        the ultimate subject, properly speaking, “is neither a quiddity,” i.e.,
        a substance, nor a quantity nor any of the other things contained in any
        genus of beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        1290. Neither can negations themselves be predicated essentially of
        matter. For just as forms are something distinct from the essence of
        matter, and thus in a certain measure are related to it accidentally, in
        a similar way the different negations of forms, which are themselves
        privations, also belong to matter accidentally. For if they should
        belong essentially to matter, forms could never be received in matter
        without destroying it. The Philosopher says this in order to reject the
        opinion of Plato, who did not distinguish between privation and matter,
        as is said in Book I of the Physics.’ Last, he concludes that for those
        who ponder the question according to the foregoing arguments it follows
        that matter alone is substance, as the preceding argument also
        concluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        1291. But this is impossible (573)He now proves the contrary of this
        conclusion, saying that matter alone cannot be substance or substance in
        the highest degree. For there are two characteristics which seem to
        belong most properly to substance. The first is that it is capable of
        separate existence, for an accident is not separated from a substance,
        but a substance can be separated from an accident. The second is that
        substance is a determinate particular thing, for the other genera do not
        signify a particular thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        1292. Now these two characteristics—being separable and being a
        particular thing—do not fit matter; for matter cannot exist by itself
        without a form by means of which it is an actual being, since of itself
        it is only potential. And it is a particular thing only by means of a
        form through which it becomes actual. Hence being a particular thing
        belongs chiefly to the composite.
      </p>
      <p>
        1293. It is clear, then, “that the specifying principle,” i.e., the
        form, and “the thing composed of both,” namely, of matter and form, seem
        to be substance to a greater degree than matter, because the composite
        is both separable and a particular thing. But even though form is not
        separable and a particular thing, it nevertheless becomes an actual
        being by means of the composite itself; and therefore in this way it can
        be both separable and a particular thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        1294. <span style="font-weight: bold">Yet that substance</span> (574).
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows how one must proceed to deal with the parts of this division of
        substance which has been followed, i.e., the division of substance into
        matter, form and composite. He says that even though both the form and
        the composite are substance to a greater degree than matter, still it is
        now necessary to dismiss the kind of substance which “is composed of
        both,” i.e., of matter and form; and there are two reasons for doing
        this.
      </p>
      <p>
        1295. One reason is that it is subsequent to both in nature, namely, to
        matter and form, just as the composite is subsequent to the simple
        elements of which it is composed. Hence a knowledge of matter and form
        precedes a knowledge of the composite substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1296. The other reason is that this kind of substance “is open to view,”
        i.e., evident, since it is the object of sensory perception; and
        therefore it is not necessary to dwell on the knowledge of it. And even
        though matter is not subsequent but is in a sense prior, still in a
        sense it is evident. Hence he says “in a sense,” because it does not of
        itself have any traits by which it may be known, since the principle of
        knowing is form. But it is known by means of an analogy; for just as
        sensible substances of this kind are related to artificial forms, as
        wood is related to the form of a bench, so also is first matter related
        to sensible forms. Hence it is said in the <i>Physics</i>, Book I, that
        first matter is known by an analogy. It follows, then, that we must
        investigate the third kind of substance, namely, form, because this is
        the most perplexing.
      </p>
      <p>1297. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now some admit</span> (575).</p>
      <p>
        Here he explains the method and order and way in which the parts of the
        third division of substance must be dealt with, in which substance is
        distinguished into those which are sensible and those which are not. In
        regard to this he does three things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1298. First, he shows what has to be done at the very beginning with
        regard to sensible substances, because sensible substances of this kind
        are admitted by all; for all admit that some sensible things are
        substances. But not all admit that there are substances which are not
        sensible. Hence it is first necessary to consider sensible substances as
        better known.
      </p>
      <p>
        1299.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Since we have established</span> (576).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he shows what has to be established about sensible substances.
        He says that since substance has been divided above according to the
        different senses in which the term is used, of which one is the essence
        of a thing, i.e., its quiddity or essential structure, it is therefore
        first necessary to investigate this by showing what it is that
        constitutes the quiddities of sensible substances.
      </p>
      <p>1300. <span style="font-weight: bold">For this is</span> (577).</p>
      <p>
        Third, he gives the reason for the order of treatment mentioned above.
        He says that we must speak first of the essences of sensible substances,
        because this is “a preparatory task,” i.e., a work preparatory to and
        necessary for our undertaking, inasmuch as we pass from sensible
        substances, which are more evident to us, to what “is more knowable in
        an unqualified sense and by nature,” i.e., to intelligible substances,
        in which we are chiefly interested. For knowledge is acquired in all
        matters, or by all men, by proceeding from those things which are less
        knowable by nature to those which are more knowable by nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        1301. For since all learning proceeds from those things which are more
        knowable to the learner, who must have some prior knowledge in order to
        learn, we must proceed to learn by passing from those things which are
        more knowable to us, which are often less knowable by nature, to those
        which are more knowable by nature but less knowable to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        1302. For with regard to the knowledge of those things which begins from
        the senses, it is those things which are closer to the senses that are
        more knowable. But those things are more knowable by nature which by
        reason of their own nature are capable of being known. Now these are the
        things which are more actual and are beings to a greater degree. And
        these lie outside the scope of sensation. But sensible forms are forms
        in matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1303. In matters of learning, then, it is necessary to proceed from
        things which are less knowable by nature to those which are more
        knowable. “And one’s task is” the same here, i.e., it is necessary to
        act in the same way here, “as in practical matters,” i.e., in the arts ‘
        and active potencies, in which we go “from things which are good for
        each individual,” i.e., from things which are good for this person and
        for that person, so as to reach those things which “are” totally good,
        or universally good, and therefore good for each individual. For the
        military art attains the victory of the whole army, which is a certain
        common good, from the victories of this and of that particular man. And
        similarly the art of building by combining particular stones succeeds in
        constructing a whole house. And so too in speculative matters we must
        proceed from those things which are more knowable to oneself, namely, to
        the one learning, in order to reach those which are knowable by nature,
        which also finally become known to the one learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        1304. Now this does not occur because the things which are more knowable
        to this person or to that person are more knowable in an unqualified
        sense; for those things which are “knowable to individual men,” i.e., to
        this or to that particular man, and are first in the process of knowing,
        are often only slightly knowable by nature. This happens because they
        have little or nothing of being; for a thing is knowable to the extent
        that it has being. For example, it is evident that accidents, motions
        and privations have little or nothing of being, yet they are more
        knowable to us than the substances of things; for they are closer to the
        senses, since of themselves they fall under sensory perception as proper
        or common sensibles. But substantial forms do so only accidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        1305. And he says “often” because sometimes the same things are more
        knowable both to us and by nature, for example, the objects of
        mathematics, which abstract from sensible matter. Hence in such cases
        one always proceeds from things which are more knowable by nature,
        because the same things are more knowable to us. And while those things
        which are more knowable to us are only slightly knowable by nature,
        still from things of the kind which are only slightly knowable by nature
        (although they are more knowable to the one learning), one must attempt
        to know the things which are “wholly,” i.e., universally and perfectly,
        knowable, by advancing to a knowledge of such things by way of those
        which are only slightly knowable by nature, as has already been
        explained.<br /></p

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 4: 102gb 12-1030a 17
      </p>
      <p>
        578. And first let us make some dialectical comments about the essence
        of a thing, because the essence of each thing is what each is said to be
        essentially (<i>per se</i>). For being you is not being musical, because
        you are not musical essentially. Therefore your essence is what you are
        said to be essentially.
      </p>
      <p>
        579. But not even all of this is the essence of a thing; for the essence
        of a thing is not what is predicated of it essentially in the way that
        white is predicated of surface, because being a surface is not being
        white. Nor is the essence of a thing the composite of the two, namely,
        being a white surface. Why? Because white inheres in surface. Therefore
        the concept (or formula) which expresses what each thing is but does not
        contain the thing itself is the concept of its essence. Hence, if being
        a white surface is always being a smooth surface, then being white and
        being smooth will be one and the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        580. Now since there are also composites in the case of the other
        categories, for there is some subject of each, for example, of quantity,
        quality, when, where and motion, it is therefore necessary to inquire
        whether there is a concept of the essence of each one of them, and
        whether this essence is found in them, for example, whether the essence
        of white man is found in white man. Now let the name of this composite
        be garment. What is the essence of garment?
      </p>
      <p>
        581. But neither is this one of those terms which are predicated
        essentially. Now there are two ways in which a term can be predicated in
        a non-essential way of a subject: one of these is by addition, and the
        other is not. For in one case the term is predicated of the thing
        defined because the term is added to something else. For example, if in
        defining white one might give the concept of white man. And in the other
        case it is so predicated because some other term is added to the
        subject; for example, if the word garment were to signify white man, and
        someone were to define a garment as white, then a white man would be
        something white, yet his essence does not consist in being white, but in
        being a garment. Therefore the essence is what a thing of a definite
        sort is, whether it expresses that thing wholly or not. Now a thing’s
        essence is what a thing is. But when something is predicated of another
        this is not some definite thing; for example, white man is not really a
        definite thing, i.e., if being a definite thing belongs to substances
        alone. Hence essence belongs to those things whose concept is a
        definition. Now there is not a definition if the name signifies the same
        thing as the concept; for then all concepts would be limiting terms,
        because the name of any concept would be the same. Hence even the
        <i>Iliad</i> will be a definition. But there is a definition if the
        concept is of some primary thing. And such things are those which are
        predicated without predicating something else of the subject. Thus
        essence will not be found in any of those things which are not species
        of a genus, but in these alone; for it seems that these things are not
        predicated according to participation and affection, or as an accident.
        But of each of the other things, if it has a name, there will be a
        concept of what it means, namely, that this accident inheres in this
        subject; or in place of a simple term one will be able to give a more
        definite one; but there will be no definition or essence.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1306. Having settled the issue about the order to be followed in
        treating of substances, the Philosopher now begins to settle the issue
        about sensible substances, as he had said he would; and this is divided
        into two parts. In the first part (578:C 1308) he settles the issue
        about the essence of sensible substances, by using dialectical and
        common arguments; and in the second (691:C 101), by considering the
        principles of sensible substances. He does this in Book VIII (“It is
        necessary, then”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two members. In the first he indicates
        the kind of essence which sensible substances have. In the second (682:C
        1648) he shows that this kind of essence has the role of a principle and
        cause (“But let us state”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two. In the first he settles the issue
        about the essences of sensible substances. In the second (650:C 1566) he
        shows that universals are not the substances of sensible things, as some
        said (“But since our investigation”).
      </p>
      <p>
        1307. The first part is divided into two. In the first he shows what
        kind of substances sensible things have. In the second (622:C 1460) he
        shows what parts constitute their substance (“But since the
        definition”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two. In the first he investigates the
        kind of essence which sensible substances have. In the second (598:C
        1381) he inquires into the causes of their generation (“Now of those
        things”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two. In the first he shows what
        constitutes the essence of sensible substances; and in the second (588:C
        1356) he shows how essence is related to sensible substances, i.e.,
        whether it is the same as these substances or different (“Moreover, it
        is necessary”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two. In the first he shows what essence
        is. In the second (580:C 1315) he indicates to what things it belongs
        (“Now since there are”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First (578), he dismisses
        from the essence of a thing any term that is predicated accidentally;
        and second (579:C 1311), any term that is predicated essentially (<i
          >per se</i
        >) in the way that properties are predicated of a subject (“But not even
        all”).
      </p>
      <p>
        1308. He says, first (578), then, that it is first necessary to speak of
        sensible substances and to show what their essence is. Therefore, let us
        first make some dialectical comments about the essence of a thing; for
        this science has a connection with dialectics, as was stated above
        (311:C 574), because both are universal. Hence the dialectical method is
        proper to this science, and it is fitting that it should begin with the
        dialectical method. But he says that he is going to treat of essence in
        a way that is chiefly dialectical inasmuch as [in so doing] he
        investigates what essence is from the manner of predicating terms of a
        subject; for this belongs properly to dialectics.
      </p>
      <p>
        1309. Regarding essence it should first of all be borne in mind that it
        must be predicated of a thing essentially; for those things which are
        predicated of a thing accidentally do not belong to its essence. For by
        the essence of a thing we mean the proper answer which can be given to
        the question asking what it is. And when we ask what a thing is we
        cannot give a proper answer by mentioning attributes which belong to it
        accidentally; for when someone asks what man is, one cannot answer that
        he is white or sitting or musical. Hence none of those attributes which
        are predicated of a thing accidentally belong to its essence; for being
        you is not being musical.
      </p>
      <p>
        1310. Now throughout the whole of the following discussion it must be
        noted that by the phrase to be this or being this he understands the
        essence of a thing; for example, by to be man or being man he
        understands what pertains to the essence of man. Now the whatness of
        “being musical,” i.e., the very essence of musical, has nothing to do
        with your whatness. For if one were to ask what you are, one could not
        answer that you are musical. Hence it follows that being you is not
        being musical, because those things which pertain to the quiddity of
        music are extrinsic to your quiddity, although musical may be predicated
        of you. And this is so because “you are not musical essentially,” since
        musical is not predicated of you essentially but accidentally. Therefore
        what you are “essentially” pertains to your whatness, because it is
        predicated of you essentially and not accidentally; for example, man,
        animal, substance, rational, sensible, and other attributes of this
        kind, all of which belong to your whatness, are predicated of you
        essentially.
      </p>
      <p>1311. <span style="font-weight: bold">But not even</span> (579).</p>
      <p>
        He excludes from the quiddity of a thing any attribute that is
        predicated essentially as properties are predicated of subjects. He says
        that not even everything that is predicated essentially of a thing
        belongs to its essence. For a property is predicated essentially of its
        proper subject as color is predicated of surface. Yet the essence of a
        thing is not something that is found in a thing essentially in the way
        that white is found in surface; because “being a surface” is not “being
        white”; i.e., the quiddity of surface is not that of whiteness; for the
        quiddity of surface differs from that of whiteness.
      </p>
      <p>
        1312. And not only is being white not the quiddity of surface, but
        neither is the combination of the two, namely, of surface and whiteness,
        i.e., to be a white surface, or being a white surface. For the quiddity
        or essence of white surface is not the quiddity or essence of surface.
        And if we were asked why, we could answer, “Because white inheres in
        surface,” i.e., because when I say “white surface” I mean something
        which adheres to surface as extrinsic to its essence and not as
        intrinsic to its essence. Hence this whole which is white surface is not
        identical with the essence of surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        1313. Now properties are predicated of their proper subjects in this way
        because their proper subjects are given in their definitions, as nose is
        given in the definition of snub and number in the definition of equal.
        And certain attributes are predicated essentially in such a way that
        subjects are not included in their definitions, as animal is predicated
        essentially of man, but man is not included in the definition of animal.
        Therefore since those attributes which are predicated accidentally do
        not belong to a thing’s quiddity, and neither do those which are
        predicated essentially in whose definitions subjects are given, it
        follows that those attributes belong to a thing’s quiddity in whose
        definitions subjects are not given. Hence he draws his conclusion,
        saying that the concept “which expresses what each thing is,” i.e.,
        which describes the predicate, “but does not contain the thing itself,”
        i.e., the subject, will be the concept of the essence in each particular
        thing. Hence animal belongs to the essence of man.
      </p>
      <p>
        1314. By a reduction to absurdity he proves that those things which are
        predicated essentially of a thing as a property is predicated of a
        subject, do not pertain to the whatness of a thing. For many different
        properties may be predicated essentially of the same subject, as the
        properties colored, rough and smooth, which are proper attributes of
        surface, are predicated essentially of a subject. And it is for the same
        reason that all predicates of this kind pertain to the quiddity of their
        subject. Therefore if whiteness pertains to the quiddity of surface, so
        also for a like reason will smoothness; for things identical with some
        third thing are identical with each other. “Hence, if being a white
        surface is always being a smooth surface,” i.e., if it is true always
        and universally that the quiddity of a property is the same as that of
        its proper subject, it follows that being white and being smooth will be
        “one and the same thing,” i.e., the quiddity of whiteness and that of
        smoothness will be one and the same. But this is obviously false.
        Therefore it follows that the essence of a property and that of its
        subject are not one and the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        1315. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now since there are</span> (580).
      </p>
      <p>
        He inquires to what things essence belongs. First, he raises the
        question; and second (581:C 1318) he answers it (“But neither”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (580), that there are certain composites in
        the case of the other categories and not merely in that of substance. He
        says this because he is investigating the quiddity of sensible
        substances, which are composite. For just as composite sensible
        substances have matter, which is the subject of substantial forms, so
        also do the other categories have their own subject. For there is some
        subject of each of them, namely, of quality, quantity, when, where, and
        also of motion, in which are included both action and being acted upon.
        Hence just as fire is a composite of matter and substantial form, in a
        similar way there is a kind of composition of substance and accidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        1316. Therefore, since there is a definition of substances which are
        composed of matters and forms, we must also inquire whether there is “a
        concept of the essence” of all those things which are composites of
        accidents and subjects, i.e., whether they have a definition which is a
        concept signifying their essence; and also whether “this essence,” which
        the definition signifies, is intrinsic to them, i.e., whether they have
        a quiddity or something that can answer the question “What?” For
        example, white man is a composite of subject and accident. The question,
        then, is whether there is an essence of white man as such.
      </p>
      <p>
        1317. And since someone might perhaps say that white man is two things
        and not one, he therefore adds that white man might have one name, say,
        garment. The question about this one thing, then, i.e., garment, will be
        whether it has any whatness, so that we can ask, “What is the essence of
        a garment?” For then just as this word man signifies some composite,
        namely, rational animal, in like manner the word garment signifies some
        composite, namely, white man. And thus just as man has a definition, in
        a similar way it seems that garment can have a definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        1318. <span style="font-weight: bold">But neither is this</span> (581).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he answers the preceding question; and this part is divided
        twofoldly inasmuch as he gives two solutions. The second part (582:C
        1331) begins where he says, “Or another solution.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first (581), then, that white man, or garment, which is
        supposed to stand for “white man,” is not one of those terms which are
        predicated essentially, but is rather one of those which are predicated
        accidentally; for the quiddity “white man” is one thing accidentally and
        not essentially, as was stated above (C 1313-14).
      </p>
      <p>
        1319. Now there are two ways in which a thing is said to be one
        accidentally or non-essentially: first, in the sense that we say “Man is
        white,” and second, in the sense that we say “This white thing is man”;
        because one of these is defined by addition, whereas the other is not.
        For in the definition of man it is not necessary to include the
        definition of white or the word white, but in the definition of white it
        is necessary to include man, or the word man, or his definition,
        provided that man is the proper subject of white, or whatever its proper
        subject happens to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        1320. Now in order to explain this he adds that when one thing is
        predicated of another in a non-essential way, it is added to the other,
        because an accident is added to the subject given in the definition of
        that accident when it is defined; for example, if someone were to define
        white thing, he would have to express the concept white man, because in
        the definition of an accident it is necessary to include its subject.
        And then the definition includes white man; and thus it will be, as it
        were, the concept of white man and not the concept of white alone. This
        must be understood to be the case, as has already been said, if man is
        the proper and essential subject of white. But the one is added to the
        other accidentally, not because it is added to the definition of the
        other, but because the other is added to it in its own definition, as
        white is added to man accidentally, not because it is placed in the
        definition of man, but because man is placed in the definition of white.
        Hence, if by supposition the word garment signifies white man, then
        anyone who defines garment must define it in the same way that white is
        defined; for just as man and white must be given in the definition of
        garment, so also must each be given in the definition of white.
      </p>
      <p>
        1321. It is clear, then, from what has been said, that white is
        predicated of man; for this proposition “A white man is white” is true,
        and vice versa. Yet the essence of white man is not that of white; and
        neither is the essence of garment, which signifies the composite white
        man, as has been stated. Thus it is evident that the essence of white
        and that of white man, or “garment,” cannot be the same, by reason of
        the fact that, if white is also predicated of white man, it is still not
        its whatness.
      </p>
      <p>
        1322. It is also evident that, if white has an essence and definition,
        it does not have a different one from that which belongs to white man;
        for since a subject is included in the definition of an accident, white
        must be defined in the same way that white man is, as has been stated.
        This is made clear as follows: white does not have a quiddity but only
        the thing of which it is predicated, man or white man. And this is what
        he means when he says: “Therefore the essence is what a thing of a
        definite sort is, whether it expresses that thing wholly or not”; i.e.,
        from what has already been said it follows that essence belongs only to
        some definite thing, whether it expresses “that thing wholly,” i.e., the
        composite, as white man, or not, as man. But white does not signify that
        it is sonic definite thing, but that it is of some sort.
      </p>
      <p>
        1323. The fact that essence belongs only to some definite thing is shown
        as follows: the essence of a thing is what that thing is; for to have an
        essence means to be some definite thing. Hence those things which do not
        signify some definite thing do not have an essence. But when something
        is predicated of another as an accident is predicated of a subject, this
        is not some definite thing. For example, when I say “Man is white” I do
        not signify that it is some definite thing, but that it is of some
        special sort. For to be some definite thing belongs to substances alone.
        Hence it is clear that whiteness and the like cannot have an essence.
      </p>
      <p>
        1324. But because someone might say that there are concepts of words
        signifying accidents as well as concepts of words signifying substance,
        he therefore concludes that essence does not belong to all things which
        have any kind of concept at all that explains their name, but only to
        those whose concept is a definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        1325. Now the concept of a thing is not definitive if it is merely a
        concept of the sort which signifies the same thing as a name, as
        <i>one bearing arms</i> signifies the same thing as <i>arms-bearer</i>,
        because it would then follow that all concepts are “limiting terms,”
        i.e., definitions. For a name can be given to any concept (for example,
        a name can be given to the concept <i>walking man</i> or
        <i>writing man</i>), yet it does not follow for this reason that these
        are definitions, because according to this it would follow that “even
        the <i>Iliad</i>,” i.e., the poem written about the Trojan war, would be
        one definition; for that whole poem is a single account depicting the
        Trojan war. It is clear, then, that not every concept signifying the
        same thing as a name is a definition of it, but only if the concept “is
        of some primary thing,” i.e., if it signifies something that is
        predicated essentially. For that which is predicated essentially is
        first in the order of predication.
      </p>
      <p>
        1326. But such things, i.e., primary ones, are all those which are
        predicated essentially, and such things do not involve predicating one
        thing of another; for example, white is not predicated essentially of
        man as though what white is and what man is are the same; but they are
        predicated of each other accidentally. For animal is predicated of man
        essentially, and in a similar way rational is predicated of animal.
        Hence the expression <i>rational animal</i> is the definition of man.
      </p>
      <p>
        1327. Thus it is clear that essence will not be found in any of those
        things which are not classed among the species of some genus, but “in
        these alone,” i.e., in the species alone. For species alone may be
        defined, since every definition is composed of genus and difference. But
        that which is contained under a genus and is constituted of differences
        is a species, and therefore definition pertains only to species. For
        species alone seem not to be predicated according to participation and
        affection or as an accident.
      </p>
      <p>
        1328. In this statement he rejects three things which seem to make it
        impossible for anything to be defined by a genus. For, in the first
        place, those things of which a genus is predicated by participation
        cannot be defined by means of that genus, unless it belongs to the
        essence of the thing defined; for example, a fiery iron, of which fire
        is predicated by participation, is not defined by fire as its genus,
        because iron by its very essence is not fire but only participates to
        some degree in fire. However, a genus is not predicated of its species
        by participation but essentially; for man is an animal essentially and
        not merely something participating in animal, because man is truly an
        animal. Moreover, subjects are predicated of their properties, as nose
        is predicated of snub, yet the essence of nose is not the essence of
        snub; for species are not related to a genus as a property of that
        genus, but as something essentially the same as that genus. And white
        can be predicated of man accidentally, but the essence of man is not the
        essence of white, as the essence of a genus is the essence of its
        species. Hence it seems that only the concept of the species, which is
        constituted of genus and difference, is a definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        1329. But if a name is given to other things, there can be a concept
        expressing what that name signifies, and this may occur in two ways.
        First, this occurs when a name that is less meaningful is explained by
        one that is more meaningful and is predicated of it, for example, when
        the name philosophy is explained by the name wisdom. And this is the
        meaning of his statement that “this accident inheres in this subject,”
        namely, that sometimes the concept explaining the name is taken from a
        more meaningful term which is predicated of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        1330. And, second, this occurs when a more meaningful phrase is used to
        explain a simple term; for example, a when the phrase lover of wisdom is
        taken to explain the term philosopher. And this is what he means when he
        says “or in place of a simple term,” as if in order to explain a simple
        term one might take “a more definite one.” Yet such a concept will not
        be a definition, nor will the thing signified by it be an essence.<br /></p

        582. Or another solution is that definition, like the whatness of a
        thing, is used in many senses. For in one sense whatness signifies the
        substance and this particular thing, and in another sense it signifies
        any of the categories, such as quantity, quality, and others such as
        these. For just as being is found in all things, although not in the
        same way, but in one thing primarily and in the others secondarily, so
        too whatness is found in an unqualified sense in substance, but in
        another sense in the other categories. For we might even speak of the
        whatness of quality, so that quality is also one of those things which
        have whatness; not in an unqualified sense, however, but just as some
        say, in a logical sense, that non-being is, not in an unqualified sense,
        but insofar as it is nonbeing; and this is also the case with quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        583. Therefore it is also necessary to consider how we must predicate it
        of each particular thing, yet not more than the condition of each
        warrants. Hence, too, since what is said is evident, essence (or
        whatness) will also be found in like manner primarily and unqualifiedly
        in substance, and then in the other categories, not as essence in an
        unqualified sense, but as the essence of quality and quantity. For these
        things must be said to be beings either equivocally or by adding or
        removing something, just as it is said that the unknowable is known. For
        the truth of the matter is that this word is used neither equivocally
        nor according to the same meaning, but just as the word medical is used
        in reference to one and the same thing, although not according to one
        and the same meaning or equivocally; for a body and an operation and an
        instrument are called medical neither equivocally nor according to one
        meaning, but in reference to one thing. It makes no difference, then, as
        to the way in which one wishes to express this.
      </p>
      <p>
        584. Now it is evident that definition and essence in the primary and
        unqualified sense belong to substances. And they belong not only to
        these but also to other things as well, although not in the primary
        sense. For if we maintain this, it is not necessary that there be a
        definition of any word which means the same thing as any concept, but it
        must mean the same thing as any determinate concept. And this will be
        the case if it is the concept of some one thing, not because it is
        continuous, like the Iliad, or one of the things which are one by being
        linked together, but if it is one according to one of the many meanings
        of that term. But the word one is used in the same number of senses as
        being is; and in one sense being signifies a particular thing, and in
        another, quantity, and in another (Itiality. And for this reason there
        will be a definition and concept of white man, but in a different sense
        from that of whiteness and of substance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">Chapter 5</p>
      <p>
        585. Now if one denies that a concept which involves the addition of
        something else is a definition, the problem arises how there can be a
        definition of things which are not simple but compound; for this must
        come about by way of addition. I mean, for example, that there is nose
        and concavity and snubness, which is a word compounded of the two,
        because the one is found in the other; and neither concavity nor
        snubness is an accidental attribute of nose, but an essential one. Nor
        do they belong to nose as white belongs to Callias or to man (because
        Callias, who happens to be a man, is white), but as male belongs to
        animal and equal to quantity, and as all those attributes which are said
        to belong to something else essentially. Now these attributes are those
        in which is found either the concept or name of the subject to which
        each one belongs, and which cannot be explained apart from it; for
        example, it is impossible to explain white apart from man, but not
        female apart from animal. Hence there is either no essence and
        definition of any of these things,,or if there is, it is in the way we
        have described (582-84).
      </p>
      <p>
        586. And there is also a second difficulty about them. For if snub nose
        and concave nose are the same, snub and concave will be the same; but if
        they are not, then, since it is impossible to use the word snub without
        the thing of which it is a proper attribute (because snub is concavity
        in a nose), either it is impossible to speak of a snub nose, or the same
        term is used twice-a concave nose nose. For a snub nose will be a
        concave nose nose. Hence it is absurd that such things should have an
        essence. And if they have, there will be an infinite regression; because
        some other nose will be found in the nose of snub-nose. It is clear,
        then, that there is definition of substance alone; for if the other
        categories also had a definition, this would have to be a result of
        adding something, just as there is no definition of equal and odd
        without number or of female without animal. And by “adding something” I
        mean those expressions in which the same thing happens to be said twice.
        And if this is true, there will not be any definition of those things
        which are compounded, for example, odd number.
      </p>
      <p>
        587. But this is hidden from us, because the concepts of these things
        are not expressed exactly. But if these things also have formulae,
        either they have such in a different way-or, as we have said (582-84),
        definition and essence must be used in many senses. Hence in one sense
        there will be no definition of anything, and definition and essence will
        be found only in substance; and in another sense the other things will
        have a definition and essence. It is evident, then, that a definition is
        a concept of the essence of a thing, and that essence belongs to
        substances either alone, or chiefly, primarily, and without
        qualification.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1331. Here he gives the second solution to the question which was
        raised; and in regard to this he does three things. First (582:C 1331),
        he gives the solution. Second (584:C 1339), he proves it (“Now it is
        evident”). Third (585:C 1342), he dispels certain difficulties which
        could arise from the previous discussion (“Now if one denies”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (582), that it is necessary to say, as was
        stated in the foregoing solution (581:C 1325) that there is no
        definition and whatness of accidents but only of substances; or
        according to another solution it is necessary to say that the terms
        definition and whatness are used in many senses. For in one sense
        whatness signifies substance and this particular thing, and in another
        sense it signifies each of the other categories, such as quantity,
        quality and the like. Moreover, just as being is said to belong to all
        the other categories, although not in the same way, but primarily to
        substance and secondarily to the others, similar fashion whatness
        belongs in an unqualified sense to substance, “but in another sense to
        the other categories,” i.e., in a qualified sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        1332. For the fact that it belongs to the others “in another sense,”
        i.e., in a qualified sense, is clear from the fact that in each of the
        other categories some reply may be made to the question “What is it?”
        For we ask of what sort a thing is, or what its quality is, as “What is
        whiteness?” And we answer, “Color.” Hence it is evident that quality is
        one of the many things in which whatness is found.
      </p>
      <p>
        1333. However, quality does not have whatness in an unqualified sense
        but the whatness of quality. For when I ask what man is, and one answers
        ‘ “Animal,” the term animal, since it belongs in the genus of substance,
        not only designates what man is, but also designates a what, i.e., a
        substance, in an unqualified sense. But when one asks what whiteness is,
        and someone answers, “Color,” this word, even though it signifies what
        whiteness is, (foes not signify what something is in an unqualified
        sense, but of what sort it is. Hence quality (foes not have whatness in
        an unqualified sense, but with some qualification. For this kind of
        whatness is found in quality, as when we say that color is the whatness
        of whiteness; and this kind of whatness is substantial rather than
        substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1334. For by reason of the fact that all the other categories get the
        notion of being from substance, the mode of being of substance, i.e.,
        being a what, is therefore participated in by all the other categories
        according to a certain proportional likeness; for example, we say that,
        just as animal is the whatness of man, in a similar fashion color is the
        whatness of whiteness, and number the whatness of double; and in this
        way we say that quality has whatness, not whatness in an unqualified
        sense, but a whatness of this particular kind; just as some say, for
        example, in speaking of non-being from a logical point of view, that
        non-being is, not because non-being is in an unqualified sense, but
        because non-being is non-being. And in a similar way quality does not
        have whatness in an unqualified sense, but the whatness of quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        1335. <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore it is also</span> (583).
      </p>
      <p>
        He now shows that whatness and definition are predicated of the nature
        found in substance and in accidents. He says that, since definition and
        whatness are found in some way both in substance and in accidents,
        therefore one must try to consider how we should “predicate it,” i.e.,
        predicate the definition, of each thing, yet no more than its condition
        warrants; so that, namely, we do not say that those predicates are
        applied univocally which do not have one essential character in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        1336. And for this reason the things which have been said about
        definition and whatness in regard to substance and accidents is clear,
        namely, that whatness will belong primarily and unqualifiedly to
        substance, and secondarily to the other categories, not, of course, so
        as to be whatness in an unqualified sense, but the whatness of this or
        that particular category, namely, of quantity or quality. For it is
        evident that definition and whatness must be predicated of substance and
        accidents either equivocally or by adding or removing something to a
        greater or lesser degree; or in a primary or secondary way, as being is
        predicated of substance and accident, and as we say that “the unknowable
        is known” in a qualified sense, i.e., secondarily, because so far as the
        unknowable is concerned we can know that it is not an object of
        knowledge; and thus we can also say of non-being that it is not.
      </p>
      <p>
        1337. For the truth is that whatness and definition are not predicated
        of substance and accidents either equivocally or unqualifiedly and
        according to the same meaning, i.e., univocally, but as the term medical
        is predicated of different particulars in reference to one and the same
        thing, although it does not signify one and the same thing in the case
        of all the things of which it is predicated; nor is it also predicated
        equivocally. For, a body is said to be medical because it is the subject
        of the art of medicine, and an activity is said to be medical because it
        is performed by the art of medicine, as purging; and an instrument, such
        as a syringe, is said to be medical because it is used by the art of
        medicine. Thus it is clear that the term medical is not used in a purely
        equivocal sense of these three things, since equivocal things have no
        relationship to some one thing. Nor again it is used univocally
        according to the same meaning, for the term medical is not predicated in
        the same sense of one who uses the art of medicine and of something that
        assists the art of medicine to produce its effect, but it is predicated
        analogically in reference to one thing, namely, to the art of medicine.
        And similarly whatness and definition are not predicated of substance
        and accident either equivocally or univocally, but in reference to one
        thing. For they are predicated of an accident in relation to substance,
        as has been explained.
      </p>
      <p>
        1338. And since he had given two solutions, he adds that it makes no
        difference as to the way in which one wishes to answer the above
        question, i.e., whether one says that accidents do not have a
        definition, or that they have one in a secondary and qualified sense.
        However, the statement made in the first solution, to the effect that
        accidents do not have a definition, is to be understood in a primary and
        unqualified sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        1339. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now it is evident</span> (584).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second he proves the solution which was given. He says that it is
        evident that definition and essence belong primarily and unqualifiedly
        to substances, yet not to substances alone since in a sense accidents
        also have a definition and essence, though not in the first way. This is
        made clear as follows: not every concept by which a word is explained is
        the same as a definition, nor is the word explained by each concept
        always something defined; but it is proper that there should be a
        definition of any determinate concept, namely, of one that signifies one
        thing. For if I say that Socrates is white and musical and curly-headed,
        this concept does not signify one thing, except perhaps accidentally,
        but signifies many; and therefore such a concept is not a definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        1340. However, it is not enough that the thing signified by a concept
        should be one thing from the viewpoint of continuity in order that there
        may be a definition of it; for then the “Iliad,” i.e., the poem about
        the Trojan war, would be a definition, because that war was waged over a
        continuous period of time. Nor again is it enough that the thing should
        be one by connection; for example, if I were to say that a house is
        stones and mortar and wood, this concept would not be a definition of a
        house. But a concept that signifies one thing will be a definition if it
        signifies in some one of those senses in which the term one is
        predicated essentially; for the term one is used in as many senses as
        being is. And in one sense being signifies this particular thing, and in
        another, quantity, and in another, quality, and so on for the other
        categories. Yet it is predicated primarily of substance and secondarily
        of the other categories. Therefore the term one in an unqualified sense
        will apply primarily to substance and secondarily to the other
        categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        1341. If, then, it is characteristic of the notion of definition that it
        should signify one thing, it follows that there will be a definition of
        white man, because white man is in a sense one thing. But the concept of
        white will be a definition in a different sense than the concept of
        substance, because the concept of substance will be a definition in a
        primary sense, and the concept of white will be a definition in a
        secondary sense, just as the term one is predicated of each in a primary
        and in a secondary sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        1342. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now if one denies</span> (585).
      </p>
      <p>
        He clears up some of the difficulties pertaining to the point
        established above; and this is divided into two parts corresponding to
        the two difficulties which he removes. The second (586:C 1347) begins
        where he says “And there is also.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Now there are two things which have to be noted first of all in order to
        make the first part of this division evident. The first is that some
        said that no definition comes about “by way of addition,” i.e., no
        definition contains anything extrinsic to the essence of the thing
        defined. And they seemed to have in mind the fact that the definition
        signifies the essence of a thing. Hence it would seem that whatever is
        extrinsic to the essence of a thing should not be given in its
        definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        1343. The second thing which has to be noted is that some accidents are
        simple and some compound. Those are said to be simple which have no
        determinate subject included in their definition, for example, curved
        and concave and other mathematical entities; and those are said to be
        compound which have a determinate subject without which they cannot be
        defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        1344. Hence a problem arises if someone wants to say that a concept
        which is formed by addition is not a definition of those accidents which
        are simple, but of those which are compound; for it seems that none of
        these can have a definition. It is clear, then, that if compound
        accidents are defined, their definition must be formed by addition,
        since they cannot be defined without their proper subject. For example,
        if we take the following three things: nose, concavity, and snubness,
        then concavity is an accident in an unqualified sense, especially in
        relation to nose, since nose is not contained in the concept of
        concavity. And snubness is a compound accident, since nose is a part of
        its concept. Thus snubness will be an expression of both inasmuch as it
        signifies that “the one is found in the other,” i.e., a definite
        accident in a definite subject, and neither concavity nor snubness is an
        attribute of nose in an accidental way, as white belongs accidentally to
        Callias and to man, inasmuch as Callias, who happens to be a man, is
        white. But snubness is an essential quality of nose, for it is proper to
        nose as such to be snub. Another translation has aquiline in place of
        concave, and its meaning is more evident, because nose is given in the
        definition of aquiline just as it is in the definition of snub.
        Concavity or snubness, then, belongs to nose essentially, just as male
        belongs to animal essentially, and equality to quantity, and all other
        things which are said to be present essentially in something else,
        because the concept of all is the same; and “these attributes are those
        in which,” i.e., in the concepts of which, there is found either the
        name of the thing “to which this attribute belongs,” namely, substance,
        or its concept. For in definitions the concept can always be given in
        place of the name; for example, when we say that man is a mortal
        rational animal, the definition can be given in place of the term
        animal, just as it may be said that man is a mortal rational sensory
        animated substance. And similarly if I say that a male is an animal
        capable of generating in another, I can also say that a male is a
        sensory animated substance capable of generating in another.
      </p>
      <p>
        1345. Thus it is clearly impossible “to explain” this, i.e., to convey
        knowledge of, one of the accidents mentioned above which we called
        compound, apart from its subject, as it is possible to convey knowledge
        of whiteness without giving man in its definition or concept. But it is
        not possible to convey knowledge of female without mentioning animal,
        because animal must be given in the definition of female just as it must
        be given in the definition of male. Hence it is evident that none of the
        compound accidents mentioned above have a whatness and real definition
        if there is no definition by way of addition, as happens in the
        definitions of substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        1346. Or if they have some kind of definition, since they can be defined
        only by way of addition, they will have a definition in a different way
        than substances do, as we said in the second solution. Hence in this
        conclusion he states the solution to the foregoing difficulty; for the
        statement which he made there, namely, that there is no definition by
        way of addition, is true of definition insofar as it applies to
        substances. Hence the accidents mentioned above do not have a definition
        in this way but differently, i.e., in a secondary sense.
      </p>
      <p>1347. <span style="font-weight: bold">And there is</span> (586).</p>
      <p>
        Here he states the second difficulty; and in regard to this he does two
        things. First, he raises the difficulty; and second (587:C 1350, he
        gives its solution (“But this is hidden”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (586), that there is another problem
        concerning the points discussed above. For to say “snub nose” and
        “concave nose” is either to say the same thing or not. If it is the
        same, it follows that snub and concave are the same; but this is clearly
        false since the definition of each is different.
      </p>
      <p>
        1348. But if to say snub nose and concave nose is not to say the same
        thing, because snub cannot be understood “without the thing of which it
        is a proper attribute,” i.e., without nose, since snubness is concavity
        in a nose (although concave can be spoken of without nose being
        involved), and if what I call snub involves more than concave, then it
        follows that this thing which I call nose either cannot be called a snub
        nose, or if it is called such, the word will be used twice, namely,
        inasmuch as we might say that a snub nose is “a concave nose nose”; for
        the definition of a word can always be given in place of that word.
        Hence when the word snub nose is used, the word snub can be removed and
        the definition of snub, which is a concave nose, can be added to the
        definition of nose. Thus it would seem that to speak of a snub nose is
        merely to speak of a concave nose nose, which is absurd. And for this
        reason it would seem absurd to say that such accidents have an essence.
      </p>
      <p>
        1349. For if it is not true that they do not have an essence, the same
        word may be repeated an infinite number of times when the definition of
        the word is put in place of that word. For it is obvious that, when I
        say “concave nose,” the word snub can be understood in place of concave,
        because snubness is merely concavity in a nose; and the term concave
        nose can also be understood in place of snub; and so on to infinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        1350. Hence it would seem to be evident that only substance has a
        definition; for if the other categories also had a definition, this
        would have to be a result of adding something to their subject, as the
        definition of equal and that of odd must be derived from the definition
        of their subjects. For there is no definition of odd without number, or
        of female, which signifies a certain quality of animal, without animal.
        Therefore if some things are defined by way of addition, it follows that
        the same words may be used twice, as was shown in the example given
        above. Hence if it is true that this absurd conclusion would result, it
        follows that compound accidents do not have a definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        1351. <span style="font-weight: bold">But this is hidden</span> (587).
      </p>
      <p>
        He solves the problem raised above. He says that anyone who raises the
        above question is ignorant of the fact that these concepts are not
        expressed exactly, i.e., with exactness, as those which are used
        univocally, but are employed in a primary and secondary way, as was
        stated above (582:C 1331). But if the compound accidents mentioned above
        have a formula, or conceptual expression, they must have such in a
        different way than definitions do, or definition and essence, which is
        signified by definition, must be used in different senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        1352. Hence “in one sense,” i.e., primarily and without qualification,
        only substance will have a definition, and only substance will have an
        essence. “And in another sense,” i.e., secondarily and with some
        qualification, the other categories will also have a definition,
      </p>
      <p>
        For substance, which has a quiddity in the absolute sense, does not
        depend on something else so far as its quiddity is concerned. An
        accident depends on its subject, however, although a subject does not
        belong to the essence of its accident (in much the same way as a
        creature depends on the creator, yet the creator does not belong to the
        essence of the creature), so that an extrinsic essence must be placed in
        its definition. In fact, accidents have being only by reason of the fact
        that they
      </p>
      <p>
        inhere in a subject, and therefore their quiddity depends on their
        subject. Hence a subject must be given in the definition of an accident
        at one time directly and at another, indirectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        1353. Now a subject is given directly in the definition of an accident
        when an accident is signified concretely as an accident fused with a
        subject, as when I say that snubness is a concave nose; for nose is
        given in the definition of snub as a genus in order to signify that
        accidents subsist only in a subject. But when an accident is signified
        in the abstract, after the manner of a substance, then the subject is
        given in its definition indirectly, as a difference, as it is said that
        snubness is the concavity of a nose.
      </p>
      <p>
        1354. Hence it is clear that when I say snub nose, it is not necessary
        to understand concave nose in place of nose; because nose is not
        included in the definition of snub as though it were part of its
        essence, but as something added to its essence. Hence snub and concave
        are essentially the same. But snub adds over and above concave a
        relation to a determinate subject; and thus in this determinate subject,
        nose, snub differs in no way from concave, nor is it necessary that any
        word should be put in place of snub except the word concave. Thus it
        will not be necessary to use concave nose in place of snub, but only
        concave.
      </p>
      <p>
        1355. In bringing his discussion to a close he draws the conclusion
        which follows as obvious, namely, that a definition, which is the
        concept of a thing’s essence and the essence itself, belongs to
        substances alone, just as the first solution maintained. Or substances
        are defined in a primary and unqualified sense, and accidents in a
        secondary and qualified sense, as has been stated in the second
        solution.<br /></p

      <p>
        588. Moreover, it is necessary to inquire whether each thing and its
        essence are the same or different; for this is a kind of preamble to the
        inquiry about substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        589. For each thing seems not to be different from its own substance,
        and the essence is said to be the substance of each thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        590. Now in the case of accidental predications each thing would seem to
        be different from its essence, as a white man would seem to be different
        from the being of a white man. For if it were the same, then the being
        of a man and that of a white man would be the same; for a man and a
        white man are the same, as they say, and therefore the being of a white
        man is the same as that of a man. Or [perhaps] it is not necessary that
        all those things which are predicated accidentally should be the same.
        For the extreme terms of a syllogism do not become the same in an
        absolute sense. But perhaps it might seem to follow that extreme terms
        which are accidental become the same, as the being of white and the
        being of musical. However, this does not seem to be the case.
      </p>
      <p>
        591. But in the case of essential predications a thing and its essence
        must always be the same. And this must be the case if there are
        substances which have no other substances or natures prior to them, such
        as some affirm the Ideas to be. For if the being of the good differs
        from the good-itself, and the being of animal from animal-itself, and
        the being of being from being-itself, there will be certain substances
        and natures and Ideas in addition to those mentioned, and these will be
        prior to substance, if essence belongs to substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        592. And if they are separated from each other, there will be no
        understanding of them, and they will not be beings. Now by
        <i>separated</i> is meant, if the being of the good is not present in
        the good-itself, and being good does not belong to this. For there is
        understanding of each thing by reason of the fact that its being is
        known; and the same thing applies to the good and to other things. Hence
        if the being of the good is not good, neither is the being of being
        being, nor the being of the one one. Now all essences are alike or none
        of them are. Hence if the essence of being is not being, neither will
        this be so in the case of other things. Furthermore, anything in which
        the being of the good is not found is not good.
      </p>
      <p>
        593. It is necessary, then, that the good be one with the being of the
        good, and that the amicable be one with the being of the amicable, and
        the same is true of all those things which are not predicated of
        something else, but are predicated primarily and essentially. For it is
        enough if this is so, even if they are not separate Forms; and perhaps
        even more if they are. It is also evident at the same time that, if the
        Ideas are such as some claim their subject will not be substance; for
        the Ideas must be substances but not be predicable of a subject; for if
        they were, they would exist only by participation in it. It is clear
        from these arguments, then, that each thing is one and the same as its
        essence, but not in an accidental way; and that to know each of these
        things is to know its essence. Hence according to this exposition both
        must be one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        594. But it is not true to say that a term which is predicated
        accidentally, as musical or white, is the same as its essence, in view
        of its twofold meaning; for both the subject to which the accident
        belongs and the accident itself are white. Hence in a sense an accident
        and its essence are the same, and in a sense they are not; for the
        essence of white is not the same as the essence of white man, but it is
        the same as the attribute white.
      </p>
      <p>
        595. Now the absurdity will become apparent if a name is given to the
        essence of each one of these; for there will also be another essence
        besides the original essence; for example, besides the essence of horse
        there will be another essence of horse. And what will prevent some
        things from already being the same as their essence, if the essence of a
        thing is its substance? Indeed, they are not only one, but their
        intelligible structure is also the same, as is clear from what has been
        said; for the unity of the essence of the one and the one is not
        accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
        596. Again, if they are different, there will be an infinite regress;
        for the one will be the essence of the being of the one, but the other
        will be the one itself. Hence the same reasoning will apply in the case
        of other things. It is clear, then, that in the case of those
        predications which are primary and essential, each thing and its being
        are identical.
      </p>
      <p>
        597. Moreover, it is evident that the sophistical arguments raised
        against this position, and the question whether Socrates and the being
        of Socrates are the same, are answered in the same way; for there is no
        difference either in the things from which one asks the question, or in
        those from which one solves it. Hence it has now been stated how the
        essence of each thing is the same as that thing, and how it is not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1356. Having established what essence is, and to what things it belongs,
        the Philosopher next inquires how essence is related to the thing of
        which it is the essence, i.e., whether it is the same as that thing or
        different; and in regard to this he does three things. First (588:C
        1356), he presents the problem. Second (589:C 1357), he gives its
        solution (“For each thing”). Third (597:C 1377,), he shows that the
        sophistical arguments which arise with regard to these matters can be
        met by using the above solution (“Moreover, it is evident”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (588), that it is necessary to inquire
        whether the essence of each thing and the thing of which it is the
        essence are the same or different, for example, whether the essence of a
        man and a man are the same or different; and it is the same in the case
        of other things. For to investigate this and make it evident is a
        “preamble to,” i.e., a basic requirement for, “the inquiry about
        substance,” which we intend to make in the following discussions. For it
        is his aim to investigate below whether universals are the substances of
        things, and whether the parts of things defined enter into their
        definition; and this inquiry which he now proposes to make is useful in
        solving that problem.
      </p>
      <p>1357. <span style="font-weight: bold">For each thing</span> (589).</p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the solution to the problem which has been raised; and in
        regard to this he does three things. First (589), he gives the solution
        to this problem. Second (591:C 1362), he proves it (“But in the case”).
        Third (595:C 1373), he shows that the opposite of the solution given
        above is absurd and impossible (“Now the absurdity”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First (589:C 1357), he
        indicates what seems to be true at first glance with regard to the
        proposed problem. Second (590:C 1358), he shows what follows from the
        contrary of this problem (“Now in the case”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (589), that it seems necessary at first
        glance, i.e., at once, to say that there is no case in which a
        particular thing differs from its own substance; and the reason is that
        the essence of a thing is the substance of the very thing of which it is
        the essence. Hence according to this argument it seems at first glance
        that the essence of a thing is the same as the thing itself and that one
        does not differ from the other.
      </p>
      <p>1358. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now in the case</span> (590).</p>
      <p>
        Then he indicates the things to which the above premise does not apply.
        He says that insofar as the essence of a thing does not seem to differ
        from the thing of which it is the essence, since it is its substance,
        then in the case of accidental predications, which do not express the
        substance of their subject, the essence of the predicate seems to differ
        from the subject. For “the being of a white man,” i.e., the essence of a
        white man, differs from a white man.
      </p>
      <p>
        1359. This seems to be the case because, when someone says “white man,”
        man is presupposed, for a man and a white man are the same, as they say.
        For if white had a different being than its subject, something might be
        predicated of the composite by means of the concept white, or it could
        be predicated of the composite because it was not opposed to the concept
        white. For whatever is predicated of a white man is so predicated only
        because it is predicated of a man; for an accident is a subject only by
        reason of a substance. Hence, insofar as man is understood in what is
        white, man and white are the same; and insofar as they are the same,
        then whatever constitutes the being of a white man will also constitute
        the being of a man. Hence if the essence of a white man is the same as a
        white man, it will also be the same as a man. But it is not the same as
        a man; and thus the essence of a white man is not the same as a white
        man. Therefore in the case of those things which are accidental, the
        essence of a thing and the thing itself are not the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        1360. Now it is evident that the essence of a white man is not the same
        as a man, because not everything that is predicated accidentally of a
        subject is necessarily the same as that subject. For a subject is in a
        sense a mean between two accidents which are predicated of it, inasmuch
        as these two accidents are one only because their subject is one; for
        example, white and musical are one because the man of whom they are
        predicated is one. Therefore man is a mean, and white and musical are
        extremes. Now if white were essentially the same as man, then by the
        same argument musical would also be the same as man. Thus the two
        extremes, white and musical, would be essentially the same, because two
        things that are identical with some other thing are themselves
        identical. But it is false that these two extreme terms are essentially
        the same, although perhaps it might seem to be true that they are
        accidentally the same. Now it is certain that white and musical are
        accidentally the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        1361. But according to this someone might think that, just as the white
        and the musical are accidentally the same, in a similar fashion “the
        being of white” and “the being of musical,” i.e., the essences of both,
        are accidentally the same. However, this does not seem to be true; for
        the white and the musical are accidentally the same because each is
        accidentally the same as a man. Now the being of white and the being of
        musical are not the same as the being of man. Hence the being of white
        and the being of musical are not accidentally the same, but only the
        white and the musical.
      </p>
      <p>1362. <span style="font-weight: bold">But in the case</span> (590).</p>
      <p>
        Then he explains the proposed solution; and in regard to this he does
        two things. First (590, he explains the solution with reference to
        essential predications; and second (594:C 1372), with reference to
        accidental predications (“But it is not true”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he explains the
        proposed solution with reference to essential predications; and second
        (593:C 1367), he draws the conclusion at which he aims (“It is
        necessary”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows that in the
        case of essential predications the essence of a thing does not differ
        from the thing of which it is the essence; and second (592:C 1363), that
        it is not separated from it (“And if”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (591), that in the case of essential
        predications the essence of a thing and the thing itself must always be
        the same. This becomes clear if one holds that there are substances
        which are separate from these sensible substances and have no other
        separated substances or natures prior to them; for the Platonists say
        that abstract ideas are substances of this kind. For if the essence of a
        thing differs from the thing itself, this will have to be true of all
        things which have an essence. Now every substance has an essence.
        Therefore the essence of every substance will differ from that
        substance. Hence the essence of an ideal substance will also differ from
        that substance. Thus “if the good itself,” i.e., the Idea of good,
        differs from “the being of the good,” i.e., from the essence of this
        Idea, and if animal-itself also differs from the being of an animal and
        if being-itself differs from the being of being, and so on in the case
        of the other Ideas, it follows that, just as there are held to be Ideas
        apart from sensible substances, in a similar fashion there will also be
        other substances and natures and Ideas apart from those mentioned by the
        Platonists. And these other substances will constitute the essence of
        these Ideas and will be prior to them. Now I say that this follows “if
        essence belongs to substance,” i.e., if each substance has an essence,
        as has been stated; or [in other words] if this essence belongs to the
        substance of the thing; for that on which a substance depends is prior
        to it.
      </p>
      <p>1363. <span style="font-weight: bold">And if</span> (592).</p>
      <p>
        He shows that the essence of a thing is not separated from the thing of
        which it is the essence. He says, “And if they are separated from each
        other,” i.e., if the essence of a thing and the thing itself are not
        only different but also separated from each other, two absurdities
        follow. The first is that there will be no understanding of those things
        whose essence is separated from them; and the second is that these same
        things will not be beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        1364. He also explains what he means by “separated,” namely, that “the
        being of the good,” i.e., the essence of the good, which the Platonists
        posit, “is not present in the good-itself,” i.e., in the Idea of good;
        and again that “being good,” i.e., the quiddity of good, is not present
        in this good; as if to say that the foregoing separation must be
        understood to mean the separation of the quiddity of the good both from
        the Idea of good and from a particular good, which is called such
        through participation in the Idea of good. Or according to another text,
        “And being good does not belong to this,” i.e., this essence is not
        proper to the being of the good in such a way that the essence of the
        good may be separated from the good, and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        1365. It is evident that the untenable conclusions mentioned above
        follow from the position described, because the understanding of each
        thing consists in a knowledge of its essence; and this applies in like
        manner both to the good and to all other things. Hence it follows that,
        if good is not present in “the being of the good,” i.e., its essence,
        neither is being present in “the being of being,” i.e., the essence of
        being, nor similarly is unity present in the being of the one, because
        either all of them alike or none of them are the same as their
        quiddities. If, however, by reason of the above-mentioned separation
        good is not present in the being of the good, then in an opposite way
        neither is the being of the good present in the good. Hence, too,
        neither will the essence of being be the same as being, nor will any
        other things have within themselves a single whatness. Thus if each
        thing is understood by means of its whatness, it follows that nothing
        can be known. This was the first absurdity mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        1366. It is also evident that “the second absurdity follows”—that
        nothing will be a being or a good or an animal or anything of this kind;
        because that cannot be good in which “the being of the good,” i.e., the
        whatness of the good, is not present. Hence if the whatness of the good
        is separated from the good, and the whatness of being is separated from
        being, it follows that the things which are said to be good and to be
        beings are neither good nor beings. This was the second absurdity
        mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>1367. <span style="font-weight: bold">It is necessary</span> (593).</p>
      <p>
        The Philosopher now draws the conclusion in which he is chiefly
        interested. He says that, since it follows, as a result of the
        difference and separation of essence from things, that things are not
        understood and are not beings, and this is absurd, “it is necessary that
        the amicable be one with the being of the amicable,” or the whatness of
        the amicable, “and that the good be one with the being of the good,”
        i.e., the quiddity of the good. He gives these two examples: the
        amicable, pertaining to particular goods, which the Platonists said were
        good by participation; and the good, pertaining to the Idea of good. And
        it is similar in the case of all other predications which are essential
        and primary and which do not involve one thing being predicated of
        something else, i.e., accidental predications; for the latter type of
        predication is of a different nature, as has been stated (579:C 1313).
        For in order that things may both be understood and be beings, it is
        enough “if this is so,” i.e., if this is true, namely, that the quiddity
        of a thing is the same as the thing itself, even though the Ideal Forms
        which the Platonists posited do not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        1368. Now the Platonists claimed that there are separate Forms only for
        this reason, that certain knowledge of sensible things might be had by
        means of these Forms, inasmuch as sensible things would exist by
        participating in them. But perhaps it is sufficient for the foregoing
        position that the whatness of a thing should be the same as the thing
        itself rather than the Form, even if it is true that there are Forms,
        because the Forms exist apart from things. Moreover, a thing is
        understood and has being by means of something which is connected with
        it and is the same as itself, rather than by means of something which is
        separated from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        1369. And from this consideration the Philosopher wants us to understand
        that separate Forms are destroyed. For if the Forms are held merely to
        account for our understanding of things and their being, and another
        position sufficiently accounts for this when it is held and the Platonic
        position is not, it follows that it is pointless to posit separate
        Forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        1370. Similarly, the same point of the non-existence of separate Forms
        is evident from another consideration. If there are Ideas, it follows
        that the thing which is their subject, namely, this particular sensible
        thing, is not a substance. For the Platonists adopted the position that
        Ideas must be substances and so not belong to any subject; for it is
        proper for a substance not to inhere in a subject. But if the subjects
        hereabout, i.e., the sensible things about us, are substances, they must
        be such by participating in these separate Forms. Hence these Forms will
        inhere in a subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        1371. From these arguments, then, it is evident that each thing and its
        whatness are one and the same in no accidental way; and similarly that
        in the act of understanding to know a particular thing is the same as to
        know its essence. “Hence according to this exposition” inasmuch as those
        things are said to be one which are one both from the viewpoint of being
        and that of being understood, it is necessary that both of these, i.e.,
        a thing and its essence, should be one.
      </p>
      <p>
        1372. <span style="font-weight: bold">But it is not true</span> (594).
      </p>
      <p>
        He explains the foregoing solution with reference to accidental
        predications. He says that in the case of accidental predications it is
        not true to say that the essence of a thing and the thing of which it is
        the essence are the same. This is so because of the twofold meaning of
        the term; for when a man is said to be white, something can be
        attributed to the subject either by reason of the subject or by reason
        of the accident. Hence if we were to say that the whatness of a white
        man is the same as a white man, two things could be meant: that it is
        either the same as a man or the same as white; for it can designate both
        the subject “to which the accident white belongs and the accident
        itself.” Hence it is clear that in one sense the whatness of a white man
        is the same as a white man, and in another it is not. For it is not the
        same as a man or even the same as white man as regards the subject, but
        it is the same as “the attribute,” i.e., white; for the essence of white
        and white itself are the same. However, it cannot be said that it is the
        same as a white man, lest it should be understood to be the same as the
        subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        1373. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now the absurdity</span> (595).
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows that the opposite of the solution mentioned is absurd; and it
        was necessary to do this because he had proved that the solution given
        above is true when separate Forms are posited; which is a position that
        he afterwards destroyed. Hence he had to repeat his proof, showing that
        what he had proved about the Forms also applies to a thing’s essence. In
        regard to this he gives two arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
        1374. In the first of these arguments he says that to affirm that the
        essence of a thing and the thing itself are different will appear absurd
        if anyone gives a name to the essence of each of these; for by the same
        argument both the thing and its essence will then be different from its
        essence; for example, a horse is something having the essence of a
        horse. Now if this differs from a horse, this will have a different
        name, and let us call it A. Therefore, since A is a thing, it will have
        an essence different from itself, just as horse does. Thus this thing
        which constitutes the being of a horse will have a different essence.
        But this is clearly false. Now this argument proceeds in the same way
        with regard to the quiddity as the first argument did with regard to the
        Ideas. And if someone were to say that the essence of a horse is the
        substance itself, which is the quidditv of a horse, what will prevent us
        from saying right now at the very start that some things are their own
        essence? By this he implies the answer, “Nothing.”
      </p>
      <p>
        1375. But it must be understood that a thing and its essence are one in
        every respect, even in their intelligible structure, as can be made
        clear from what has been said. For the one and the essence of the one
        are one not in an accidental way but essentially; and thus they are one
        in their intelligible structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        1376. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, if they are</span> (596).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second argument, which runs as follows: if the essence
        of a thing and the thing itself are different, there will be an infinite
        regress; for we must say that there are two things, one of which is the
        one, and the other the essence of the one; and by the same argument
        there will be a third thing, which would be the essence of the essence
        of the one, and so on to infinity. Now since an infinite regress is
        impossible, it is evident that, in the case of predications which are
        primary and essential and not accidental, each thing and its being are
        one and the same.
      </p>
      <p>1377. Moreover, it is evident (597).</p>
      <p>
        He says that the sophistical arguments which are raised against this
        position in order to show that the essence of a thing and the thing
        itself are not the same, are clearly met by means of the same solution
        which was given to the first problem. For example, the Sophists ask if
        Socrates and the being of Socrates are the same, and they show that they
        are not by saying that, if Socrates and the being of Socrates are the
        same, and Socrates is white, it follows that white and the being of
        Socrates, and so on, are the same. Now the solution is clear from what
        has been said above. “For there is no difference either in the things
        from which one asks the question, or in those from which one solves it,”
        i.e., it makes no difference from what things one proceeds to argue, or
        to what questions one adapts the answer, inasmuch as the solution is
        basically the same. Hence from what has been said it is evident when the
        essence of each thing is the same as each thing and when it is not; for
        it is the same in the case of essential predications, but not in that of
        accidental ones.
      </p>
      <p><i>Distinction between abstract and concrete essence</i></p>
      <p>
        1378. In support of the statements which he has made it must also be
        noted that the <span style="font-weight: bold">whatness</span> of a
        thing is what its definition signifies. Hence when a definition is
        predicated of the thing defined, the whatness of that thing must also be
        predicated of it. Therefore, (~)
        <span style="font-weight: bold">humanity</span>, which is not predicated
        of man, is not the whatness of man, but (+)
        <span style="font-weight: bold">mortal rational animal</span> is; for
        the word humanity does not answer the question, “What is man?” But
        mortal rational animal does.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet humanity is taken as the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">formal principle</span> of the essence,
        just as animality is taken as (+) the principle of the genus and not as
        (~) the genus, and as rationality is taken as the (+) principle of the
        difference and not as (~) the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        1379. Now to this extent
        <span style="font-weight: bold">humanity</span> is not absolutely the
        same as man, because it implies only the essential principles of man and
        excludes all accidents. For humanity is that by which man is man. But
        none of the accidents of a man is that whereby he is a man. Hence all
        accidents of man are excluded from the meaning of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now it is the particular thing itself, namely, a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">man</span>, which contains the essential
        principles and is that in which accidents can inhere. Hence although a
        man’s accidents are not contained in his intelligible expression, still
        man does not signify something apart from his accidents.
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >Therefore man signifies as a
          <span style="font-weight: bold">whole</span> and humanity as a
          <span style="font-weight: bold">part</span></span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        1380. Moreover, if there is some thing in which no accident is present,
        then this thing the abstract must differ in no way from the concrete.
        This is most evident in the case of God.

      <p>
        598. Now of those things which come to be, some come to be by nature,
        some by art, and some spontaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        599. And everything which comes to be comes to be by something and from
        something and becomes something. And this something which I say it comes
        to be may be in any category; for it may come to be either a this or so
        much or of such a sort or at some time.
      </p>
      <p>600. Now natural generations are those which come about by nature.</p>
      <p>
        601. And that from which a thing comes to be is what we call matter; and
        that by which it comes to be is one of those things which exist by
        nature. And this something which it comes to be is a man or a plant or
        some other one of those things which we chiefly claim to be substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        602. Now all things which come to be either by nature or by art have
        matter; for it is possible for each one of them to be and not to be, and
        this possibility is the matter of each.
      </p>
      <p>
        603. And in general both that from which they come to be and that
        according to which they come to be is nature; for the thing generated,
        such as a plant or an animal, has a nature. And that by which they are
        generated, i.e., the so-called specific nature, which is specifically
        the same, is also nature (although this is found in something else); for
        man begets man. The things which come to be by nature, then, are
        produced in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        604. But the other kinds of generation are called “productions”; and all
        productions are a result either of art, of power, or of mind. And some
        of these are a result of chance and fortune in the same way as things
        which come to be by nature; for some of these same things are generated
        both from seed and without seed. Therefore we shall have to investigate
        these later on (619).
      </p>
      <p>
        605. Now those things are produced by art whose form exists in the mind;
        and by form I mean the essence of each thing and its first substance.
        For even contraries have in a sense the same form; for the substance of
        a privation is the same as the substance of its opposite, as health is
        the substance of sickness, for sickness is made apparent by the absence
        of health; and the health which exists in the mind is the concept in
        scientific knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        606. Health comes about, then, as a result of thinking in this manner:
        since health is such and such, if health is to exist, such and such a
        condition must exist, for example, regularity; and if this is to exist
        there must be heat; and the physician continues to think in this way
        until he eventually comes to some final tiling which he is capable of
        doing. Hence, the motion which begins from this, which is ordained to
        the acquisition of health, is called production. Hence it turns out that
        in a sense health comes from health, and a house from a house, and what
        has matter from what is without matter; for the medical art and the
        building art are the form of health and the form of a house. And by
        substance without matter I mean the essence.
      </p>
      <p>
        607. Now of generations and motions one part is called thinking and the
        other producing; for that which proceeds from the principle and the form
        is thinking, and that which proceeds from the terminus of thinking is
        producing. And each of the other, intermediate, things is produced in
        the same way. I mean that if health is to be restored a balance must be
        achieved. What, then, does a balance involve? Some particular thing. And
        this will occur if the body is heated. And what does this involve?
        Something else. And this exists potentially; and it is present already
        in the physician himself. The thing which produces the effect, then, and
        that from which the restoration of health begins if it comes to be by
        art, is the form in the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        608. But if it comes to be by chance, the thing which produces it is the
        starting point of production for the one who acts by art. For instance,
        in the restoration of health the starting point may perhaps be the
        production of heat, which the physician causes by rubbing. The heat in
        the body, then, is either a part of health, or it is followed by some
        such thing as is a part of health, or it comes about through several
        intermediaries. Now this last thing is the one producing health, and
        what is such is a part of health, as stones are parts of a house and
        other materials are parts of other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        609. Hence, as is said, it is impossible for anything to be produced if
        nothing pre-exists. Therefore that some part will necessarily pre-exist
        is evident; for the matter is a part, since it exists in the product and
        becomes something. Hence it is also one of those things which are
        contained in the intelligible expression of a thing. And we describe
        what brazen circles are in both ways, saying about the matter that it is
        bronze, and about the specifying principle that it is such and such a
        figure. And this is the genus in which circle is first placed. Hence a
        brazen circle has matter in its intelligible expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        610. Now as for that from which as matter a thing, is produced, some
        things when they are produced are hot said to be that but of that kind;
        for instance, a statue is not stone but of stone. And a man who is
        recovering his health is not said to be that from which he has come. The
        reason is that, although a thing comes both from its privation and from
        its subject, which we call matter (for example, what becomes healthy is
        both a man and one who is sick), we say that it comes rather from its
        privation (for example, a healthy person comes from a sick one rather
        than from a man). And for this reason a healthy person is not said to be
        a sick one, but to be a man, and the man is said to be healthy. However,
        as regards those things of which the privation is not evident and is
        nameless (for example, the privation of some particular figure in bronze
        or in the bricks and timbers of a house), the thing produced seems to
        come from these just as a healthy person comes from a sick one. Hence,
        just as in the former case a thing is not said to be that from which it
        comes to be, so too in this case the statue is not said to be wood but
        wooden, not bronze but brazen, not stone but of stone; and a house is
        not said to be bricks but of bricks. For if someone were to examine the
        question carefully, he would not say without qualification either that
        the statue comes from wood or the house from bricks, because there must
        be change in that from which something comes to be without remaining. It
        is for this reason, then, that we speak in this way.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1381. Having shown what essence is and to what things it belongs, and
        that it does not differ from the thing to which it belongs, the
        Philosopher now aims to show that the essences and forms present in
        these sensible things are not generated by any forms existing apart from
        matter, but by forms present in matter. And this will be one of the ways
        in which the position of Plato is destroyed; for Plato claimed that
        there are separate Forms, and that these are necessary both in order
        that an understanding of sensible things may be had, and that sensible
        things may exist by participating in them, and and that these Forms may
        be responsible for the generation of sensible things. Now he has already
        shown, in the preceding chapter (593:C 1368), that separate Forms are
        not necessary either to account for our understanding of sensible things
        or their being, since these can be adequately explained on the grounds
        that the whatness of a sensible thing is both present in that thing and
        identical with it. Hence it remains to show that separate Forms are not
        required for the generation of sensible things; and he proves this in
        this chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        This undertaking is accordingly divided into two parts. In the first
        (598:C 1381) he prefaces his discussion with certain points required for
        the proof of his thesis. In the second (611:C IV7), he proves his thesis
        (“Now since”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he proposes certain
        divisions regarding the processes of generation which take place in the
        natural world. Second (600:C 1385), he explains these (“Now natural
        generations”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives two divisions. The first his to do with things that are
        generated and with their mode of generation; and the second (599:C
        1383), with the conditions necessary for generation (“And everything”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (598), that of things which come to be, some
        come to be by nature, some by art, and some by chance, or
        “spontaneously,” i.e., by itself without purpose. The reason for this
        division is that the cause of generation is either a proper cause or an
        accidental one. For if it is a proper cause, it is either the principle
        of motion intrinsic to a thing, and then it is nature, or it is
        extrinsic to the thing, and then it is art; for nature is a principle of
        motion in that in which it exists, but art does not exist in the thing
        produced by art but in something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        1382. But if it is an accidental cause, then it is chance or fortune. It
        is fortune in reference to those things which act by mind, but chance
        occurs in other things also; and both of these come under “the
        spontaneous,” i.e., what is of itself without purpose; for that is
        without purpose which is directed to a goal and does not reach it. And
        both chance and fortune are found among those things which are done for
        the sake of some goal, when some effect results besides the one intended
        by some definite proper cause. Hence an effect is said to be proper
        inasmuch as it has a definite cause, and to be without purpose inasmuch
        as it occurs apart from the intention of the agent.
      </p>
      <p>1383. <span style="font-weight: bold">And everything</span> (599).</p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second division, which involves the conditions of
        generation; for everything which comes to be is brought about by some
        agent, and is produced from something as its matter, and also becomes
        something, which is the terminus of generation. And since he had said
        above that this something belongs in the class of substances) he
        therefore now informs us that this must be understood in a more general
        way, inasmuch as by something is meant any category in which generation
        can occur, in an unqualified or qualified sense, essentially or
        accidentally. For the something of which he spoke is either “a this,”
        i.e., a substance, or a quantity or quality or time or some other
        category.
      </p>
      <p>
        1384. And the reason for this division is that in every generation
        something which was formerly potential becomes actual. Now a thing can
        be said to go from potency to actuality only by reason of some actual
        being, which is the agent by which the process of generation is brought
        about. Now potency pertains to. the matter from which something is
        generated: and actuality pertains to the thing generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        1385.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Now natural generations</span> (600).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he explains that these three conditions required for generation are
        found in the three types mentioned; and in regard to this he does two
        things. First (600:C 1385), he explains his thesis. Second (609:C 1412),
        he introduces the conclusion which he chiefly intends to draw (“Hence,
        as is said”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he makes this clear
        in the case of natural generations; and second (604:C 1394), in the case
        of generations resulting from art (“But the other”); and third (608:C
        1410, in the case of those generations which come about by chance (“But
        if it comes).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does four things. First (600), he indicates
        what generations are natural. He says that those generations are natural
        whose principle is nature and not art or any mind, for example, when
        fire or a plant or an animal is generated as a result of the natural
        power inherent in things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1386. <span style="font-weight: bold">And that from which</span> (601).
      </p>
      <p>
        Having posited these three conditions he now gives examples of natural
        generations. He says that in natural generation there is something from
        which any natural thing is generated, and this is called matter; and
        something by which it is generated, and this is called the agent; and
        there is this particular thing, namely, the thing generated, such as a
        man or a plant or something of this sort, which “we chiefly claim to be
        substances,” i.e., particular composite substances, which are more
        evidently substances, as was stated above. But matter and the form,
        which is the principle of action in the agent, are substances only
        insofar as they are principles of composite substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        1387. Now of these three conditions, two have the nature of principles
        of generation, namely, matter and the agent, and the third has the
        nature of a terminus of generation, i.e., the composite which is
        generated. And since nature is a principle of generation, both the
        matter as well as the form, which is the principle of generation in the
        agent, are called nature, as is evident in Book II of the
        <i>Physics</i>. And the composite which is generated is said to be by
        nature or according to nature.
      </p>
      <p>1388. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now all things</span> (602).</p>
      <p>
        Here he proves that one of these three conditions—the principle from
        which a thing comes to be—is found in every kind of generation, not only
        in natural generations but also in artificial ones (for the nature of
        the other two conditions is evident). He says that all the things which
        come to be by nature or by art have a matter from which they come to be;
        for everything that is generated by nature or by art is capable both of
        being and of not being. For since generation is a change from non-being
        to being, the thing generated must at one time be and at another not be,
        and this would be true only if it were possible for it both to be and
        not to be. Now the potential element which each thing has both for being
        and not being is matter; for it is in potentiality to the forms by which
        things have being, and to the privations by which they have non-being,
        as is clear from what was said above. Therefore it follows that there
        must be matter in every kind of generation.
      </p>
      <p>1389. <span style="font-weight: bold">And in general</span> (603).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows how the three conditions mentioned above are related to
        nature. He says that in general each of the three conditions mentioned
        above is in a sense nature. For the principle from which natural
        generation proceeds, namely, matter, is called nature; and for this
        reason the generations of simple bodies are said to be natural ones,
        even though the active principle of their generation is extrinsic to
        them. This seems to be contrary to the very notion of nature, because
        nature is an intrinsic principle having a natural aptitude for such a
        form; and processes of generation which proceed from this principle are
        said to be natural.
      </p>
      <p>
        1390. Again, the principle according to which generation comes about,
        namely, the form of the thing generated, is said to be its nature, as a
        plant or an animal; for a natural generation is one which is directed
        towards nature just as the act of whitening is one which is directed
        towards whiteness.
      </p>
      <p>
        1391. Again, the principle by which generation comes about, as by an
        agent, is the specific nature, which is specifically the same as the
        nature of the thing generated, although it exists in something else; for
        man begets man. However, the thing generated and the one generating it
        are not numerically the same but only specifically the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        1392. And for this reason it is said in Book II of the
        <i>Physics</i> that the form and the goal of the process of generation
        coincide in one and the same individual. Now the agent coincides with
        these insofar as it is specifically the same but not insofar as it is
        numerically the same. But the matter is neither specifically the same
        nor numerically the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        1393. Another text states that the principle by which a thing comes to
        be is the so-called specific nature or one conforming to it; for the
        thing generated and the one generating it are not always specifically
        the same, although they do have some conformity, as when a horse begets
        a mule. Finally, he concludes that the things generated by nature are
        generated in the manner described.
      </p>
      <p>
        1394. <span style="font-weight: bold">But the other kinds</span> (604).
      </p>
      <p>
        He now settles the issue about the things generated by art; and in
        regard to this he does two things. First (604), he distinguishes
        processes of generation arising from art from other processes of
        generation, namely, natural ones. Second (605:C 1404), he shows how
        generation comes about by art (“Now those things”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first, that those processes of generation which
        differ from natural ones are called productions. For even though in the
        case of natural things we can use the word production, which is
        equivalent to praxis in Greek (as when we say that what is actually hot
        produces something which is actually hot), still we use the word
        properly in reference to those things which come about as a result of
        mind, in which the mind of the agent has dominion over the thing which
        he makes inasmuch as he can make it in this way or in that. But this
        does not occur in the case of natural things, for they rather act with a
        view to some effect in the definite manner provided for them by a
        superior agent. Moreover, productions of this kind are a result of art,
        of power, or of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        1395. Now the tern, power used here seems to be taken in the sense of
        violence; for certain of those things which do not come about by nature
        are produced by virtue of the agent’s power alone, in which a minimum of
        art is required and a minimum of activity directed by mind. This occurs
        especially in pulling or throwing or casting out bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        1396. Moreover, when the direction of mind is required, at one time this
        comes about by art, and at another by mind alone, as when one does not
        yet have an artistic habit perfectly. For just as one person may argue
        by art, and another without art, as an unlearned person, so too in
        reference to those things which are made by art one can produce an
        artistic work by art, and someone else without art.
      </p>
      <p>
        1397. Furthermore, of those processes of generation which are a result
        either of art, of power, or of mind, some are a result of chance and
        fortune, for example, when an agent by use of intelligence aims at some
        goal to be attained by his own activity, and ‘a goal is reached which
        the agent did not intend. For example, someone intends to rub himself
        vigorously and health comes of it, as is said later (C 1403).
      </p>
      <p>
        1398. And the same thing occurs in the case of things produced by art as
        in those produced by nature; for the power contained in the seed, as is
        said below (619:C 1451), is similar to art, because just as art through
        certain definite intermediates attains the form at which it aims, so
        also does the formative power in the seed. And just as an effect
        produced by art may also occur apart from the intention of art or of
        mind, and then it is said to happen by chance, so too in the case of
        these things, i.e., natural ones, some things are generated both from
        seed and without seed. And when they are generated from seed, they are
        generated by nature; but when they are generated without seed, they are
        generated by chance. These things must also be investigated in this same
        chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1399. Now the words used here give rise to two problems. The first is
        that, since every natural thing has a definite mode of generation, those
        things which are generated from seed and those which are generated from
        decay do not seem to be the same. This is what Averroes seems to feel in
        his commentary on Book VIII of the <i>Physics</i>, for he says that an
        animal which is generated from seed and one which is generated from
        decay cannot be specifically the same. Avicenna, however, feels that all
        things which are generated from seed can be generated in the same
        species without seed from decay, or by some method of blending
        terrestrial matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        1400. Aristotle’s view seems to be a mean between these two opinions,
        namely, that some things can be generated both from seed and without
        seed, but not all things, as he says below (610:C 1454); just as in the
        case of things produced by art not all things can be produced by art and
        without art, but some are produced by art alone, as a house. For perfect
        animals seem to be capable of being generated from seed, whereas
        imperfect animals, which are akin to plants, seem to be capable of being
        generated both from seed and without seed. For instance, plants are
        sometimes produced without seed by the action of the sun on the earth
        when it is rightly disposed for this effect; yet plants generated in
        this way produce seed from which plants of a similar kind are generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        1401. And this is reasonable, because the more perfect a thing is the
        more numerous are the things required for its completeness. And, for
        this reason, in the generation of plants and imperfect animals it is
        sufficient that the power of the heavens alone should act. But in the
        case of perfect animals the power of the seed is also needed along with
        the power of the heavens. Hence it is said in Book II of the
        <i>Physics</i> that man and the sun beget man.
      </p>
      <p>
        1402. The second problem is that animals which are generated without
        seed from decay do not seem to be produced by chance but by some
        definite agent, namely, by the power of the heavens, which supplies in
        the generation of such animals the energy of the generative power found
        in the seed. The Commentator is also of this opinion in his commentary
        on Book IX of this work.
      </p>
      <p>
        1403. But it must be noted that nothing prevents a process of generation
        from being a proper process when referred to one cause, and yet be an
        accidental or chance affair when referred to another cause, as is
        evident in the Philosopher’s example. For when health results from a
        vigorous rubbing quite apart from the aim of the one doing the rubbing,
        the process of restoring health, if it is referred to nature, which
        governs the body, is not accidentally but properly aimed at. However, if
        it is referred to the aim of the one doing the rubbing, it will be
        accidental and a matter of chance. Similarly, if the process of
        generation of an animal generated from decay is referred to the
        particular causes acting here below, it will also be found to be
        accidental and a matter of chance; for heat, which causes decay, is not
        inclined by nature to have as its goal the generation of this or that
        particular animal which results from decay, as the power in the seed has
        as its goal the generation of something of a particular type. But if it
        is referred to the power of the heavens, which is the universal power
        regulating generation and corruption in these lower bodies, it is not
        accidental but is directly aimed at, because its goal is that all forms
        existing potentially in matter should be brought to actuality. Thus
        Aristotle has correctly compared here the things which come to be by art
        with those which come to be by nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        1404. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now those things</span> (605).
      </p>
      <p>
        He now explains the way in which things are generated by art; and he
        does this chiefly with reference to the efficient principle, for the
        material principle has already been discussed where he spoke about
        natural generation. In regard to this he does two things. First, he
        shows what the active principle is in a process of generation resulting
        from art. Second (606:C 1406), he shows how the process of generation
        proceeds from this principle (“Health comes about”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (605), that those things which come to be by
        art are those of which the productive form exists in the mind. And by
        form he means the essence of anything made by art, for example, the
        essence of a house, when it is a house that is made. He also calls this
        the “first substance,” i.e., the first form; and he does this because
        the form present in the matter of things made by art proceeds from the
        form present in the mind. In the case of natural things, however, the
        opposite is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        1405. Now the form present in the mind differs from the one present in
        matter; for in matter the forms of contraries are different and opposed,
        but in the mind contraries have in a sense the same form. And this is
        true because forms present in matter exist for the sake of the being of
        the things informed, but forms present in the mind exist according to
        the mode of what is knowable or intelligible. Now while the being of one
        contrary is destroyed by that of another, the knowledge of one contrary
        is not destroyed by that of another but is rather supported by it. Hence
        the forms of contraries in the mind are not opposed, but rather “the
        substance,” i.e., the whatness, “of a privation,” is the same as the
        substance of its contrary, as the concepts of health and of sickness in
        the mind are the same; for sickness is known by the absence of health.
        Further, the health which exists in the mind is the concept by which
        health and sickness are known; and it is found “in the scientific
        knowledge” of both, i.e., in knowing both.
      </p>
      <p>
        1406. <span style="font-weight: bold">Health comes about</span> (606).
      </p>
      <p>
        He now shows how health is produced by this principle; and in regard to
        this he does two things. First, he shows how the health which exists in
        the mind is the principle (or starting point) for the restoring of
        health; and second (607:C 1408), how the term <i>principle</i> is taken
        in different ways in regard to the activity of art (“Now of
        generations”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says (606) that, since the health present in the mind is
        the principle of the health produced by art, health is brought about in
        a subject as a result of someone thinking in this manner: since health
        is such and such, i.e., either regularity or the balance of heat, cold,
        moisture and dryness, if health is to exist, it is necessary that this
        exist, i.e., regular or the balance of humors; and if regularity or
        balance must exist, there must be heat, by which the humors are
        balanced; and thus by always going from what is subsequent to what is
        prior he thinks of the thing which is productive of heat, and then of
        the thing which is productive of this, until he reaches some final thing
        which he himself is immediately capable of doing, for example, the
        dispensing of some particular medicine; and finally the motion beginning
        from the thing which he can do immediately is said to be the activity
        directed to the production of health.
      </p>
      <p>
        1407. Hence it is evident that, just as in the case of natural things
        man is generated from man, so too in the case of artificial things it
        turns out that health comes to be in a sense from health, and a house
        from a house; i.e., from what exists in the mind without matter there is
        produced something which has matter. For the medical art, which is the
        principle of health, is nothing else than the form of health existing in
        the mind; and this form or substance which exists without matter is the
        one which he speaks of above as the essence of the thing produced by
        art.
      </p>
      <p>
        1408. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now of generations</span> (607).
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows how the word principle is taken in different ways in regard to
        the activities of art. He says that in artificial generations and
        motions there is one activity which is called thinking and another which
        is called producing. For the artist’s planning, which begins from the
        principle which is the form of the thing to be made by his art, is
        itself called thinking; and this activity extends, as was said above,
        right down to what is last in the order of intention and first in the
        order of execution. Therefore the activity which begins from this last
        thing in which the activity of thinking terminates, is called producing,
        and this is then a motion affecting matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1409. And what we have said about the activity of art in reference to
        the form, which is the ultimate goal of artificial generation, also
        applies in the case of all other intermediate things; for example in
        order that one may be healed the humors of the body must be balanced.
        Hence this process of balancing is one of the intermediate things which
        is nearest to health. And just as the physician when he aims to cause
        health must begin by considering what health is, so too when he intends
        to produce a balance he must know what a balance is, namely, that it is
        “some particular thing,” i.e., the proportion of humors appropriate to
        human nature. “And this will occur if the body is heated”—supposing that
        someone is sick because of a lack of heat. And again he must know what
        this is, i.e., what being heated is, as if one might say that being
        heated consists in being changed by a hot medicine. And “this, namely,
        the administering of a hot medicine, is immediately within the
        physician’s power; and “this is already present in the physician
        himself,” i.e., it is within his power to administer such a medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        1410. Hence it is evident that the principle causing health, from which
        the process of restoring health begins, is the form existing in the
        mind, either of health itself, or of other intermediate things by means
        of which health is produced. And I say that this is the case if the
        process of restoring health comes about by art. But if it comes about in
        some other way, the principle of health will not be a form existing in
        the mind; for this is proper to artificial operations.
      </p>
      <p>1411. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if it</span> (608).</p>
      <p>
        He shows how chance generations take place. He says that, when the
        restoring of health comes about by chance, the principle of health is
        the same as the one from which health comes about for him who causes
        health by art. But this must be understood of the principle of
        production, which is last in the order of intention and first in the
        order of execution, just as in the process of restoring health the
        principle of health may at times begin with the patient’s being heated.
        And the process of restoring health also begins here when someone is
        healed by chance, because someone may produce heat by rubbing but not
        intend this as the goal of the rubbing. Thus the heat produced in the
        body by rubbing or by a medication either is a part of health, inasmuch
        as it is something entering into the substance of health, as when by
        itself the alteration of being heated is sufficient to promote health;
        or something which is a part of health may result from heat, as when
        health is produced as a result of the heat dissolving certain congested
        humors, the dissolution of which thereupon constitutes health. Or it can
        also be produced by several intermediates, as when heat consumes certain
        superfluous humors blocking some passage in the body, so that when these
        have been removed the proper movement of spirits to some parts of the
        body then begins; and this final step is the one then causing health.
        “And what is such,” namely, the proximate cause of health, “is a part of
        health,” i.e., something entering into the make-up of health. And it is
        the same with other things produced by art; for the parts of a house are
        the stones whose bonding in the course of construction goes to
        constitute a house.
      </p>
      <p>
        1412. <span style="font-weight: bold">Hence, as is said</span> (609).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he draws the conclusion at which he chiefly aims; and in regard to
        this he does two things. First, he introduces this conclusion; and
        second (610:C 1414), he dispels a difficulty (“Now as for that”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first (609), that, since everything which comes to be is
        generated from matter and is also generated by something like itself, it
        is impossible for anything to be generated unless something pre-exists,
        as is commonly said; for the common opinion of the philosophers of
        nature was that nothing comes to be from nothing. Further, it is evident
        that the thing which preexists must be part of the thing generated, and
        this can be shown from the fact that matter is present in the thing
        generated and becomes the thing generated when it is brought to
        actuality. And not only the. material part of a thing pre-exists, as is
        clear from the explanation given, but so also does the part which exists
        in the mind, namely, the form; for these two principles, matter and
        form, are parts of the thing generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        1413. For we can describe what brazen circles are in both ways, or,
        according to another text, what many circles are, i.e., particular and
        distinct circles, by stating the matter, which is bronze, and “by
        stating the specifying principle,” i.e., the form, which is such and
        such a figure. And he is right in saying many particular circles; for a
        circle is one thing specifically and formally, but it becomes many and
        is individuated by matter. And this, the figure, is the genus in which
        brazen circle is first placed. Hence it is evident, from what has been
        said, that brazen circle has matter in its definition. And the fact that
        the form of the thing generated pre-exists has been made clear above
        both in reference to natural generations and to artificial productions.
      </p>
      <p>1414. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now as for that</span> (610).</p>
      <p>
        Here he dispels. a certain difficulty; for that from which a thing comes
        to be as its matter is sometimes predicated of it not abstractly but
        denominatively; for some things are not said to be “that,” i.e., the
        matter, “but of that kind”; for instance, a statue is not said to be
        stone but of stone. And a man who is recovering his health “is not said
        to be that f rom which ' “ i.e., one does not predicate of him the thing
        from which, he is said to come to be; for a person who is recovering his
        health comes from a sick person. But we do not say that a person who is
        recovering his health is a sick one.
      </p>
      <p>
        1415. Now the reason for this kind of difficulty is that one thing is
        said to come from something else in two ways, namely, from a privation
        and from a subject, which is matter, for example, when it is said that a
        man recovers his health, and that a sick person recovers his health. But
        a thing is said to come from a privation rather than from a subject; for
        example, a healthy person is said to come from a sick one rather than
        from a man. But when one thing becomes another we say this in reference
        to the subject rather than to the privation; for properly speaking we
        say that a man rather than a sick person becomes healthy. Therefore a
        healthy person is not said to be a sick one, but rather a man; and in
        the opposite way it is a man that is said to be healthy. Hence the thing
        that comes to be is predicated of the subject, not of the privation.
      </p>
      <p>
        1416. But in some cases the privation is not evident and is nameless;
        for example, the privation of any particular figure in bronze does not
        have a name, and neither does the privation of house in the stones and
        timbers. Therefore we use the term matter simultaneously to designate
        both the matter and the privation. Hence just as we say in the one case
        that a healthy person comes from a sick one, so too we say in the other
        case that a statue comes from bronze, and a house from stones and
        timbers. And for this reason, too, just as in the one case the thing
        that comes to be from something taken as a privation is not predicated
        of the subject, because we do not say that a healthy person is a sick
        one, neither do we say in the other case that a statue is wood; but the
        abstract term is predicated concretely by saying that it is not wood but
        wooden, not bronze but brazen, not stone but of stone. And similarly a
        house is not bricks but of bricks. For if someone were to examine the
        question carefully, he would not say in an unqualified sense either that
        the statue conics froin wood or the house from bricks, litit that it
        conics to be as a result of some change. For the former comes from the
        latter taken as something which is changed and not as something which
        remains, because bronze does not stay formless while it is being made
        into a statue, nor do bricks stay unbonded while a house is being built.
        And for this reason “we speak in this way,” i.e., Predication is made in
        this way, in the cases mentioned above.<br /></p

      <p>
        611. Now since that which comes to be comes to be by something (and by
        this I mean the principle of generation), and from something (and by
        this let us understand not the privation but the matter; for this has
        already been defined [601] in our discussion about these things), and
        becomes something (i.e., a sphere or a circle or whatever else it may
        be), just as the agent does not produce the underlying subject, i.e.,
        the bronze, neither does he produce a sphere, except accidentally,
        because a brazen sphere is a sphere and he produces the former. For to
        make this particular thing is to make it out of the subject totally. I
        mean that to make the bronze round is not to make round or sphere but
        something else, i.e., to cause this form in something else. For if he
        makes a form he makes it out of something else (this was assumed above);
        for example, he makes a brazen sphere. And he makes this in the sense
        that he makes this thing which is a sphere out of this thing which is
        bronze. Hence if he also produces the underlying subject itself,
        evidently he will produce it in the same way, and processes of
        generation will then proceed to infinity. Hence it is evident that
        neither the form nor anything else which we term the form in a sensible
        thing comes to be; i.e., the form or essence is not generated, for this
        is what comes to be in some thing else either by art, by nature or by
        power.
      </p>
      <p>
        612. But he does make a brazen sphere to be. For he makes it from bronze
        and and a sphere, because he causes this form in this matter, and this
        constitutes a brazen sphere; and this is the being of a sphere. But if
        the being of sphere in general is to be produced, something will be
        produced from nothing; for that which comes to be must be divisible, and
        this is this and that is that. And by this I mean the matter, and by
        that the form. Therefore, if a sphere is a figure everywhere equidistant
        from a center, one part of this will be that in which the thing produced
        exists, and the other will be what exists in this. But this is all that
        has been produced, as in the case of a brazen sphere. It is evident from
        what has been said, then, that it is not the thing which is called the
        form or substance that is generated, but the concrete whole which gets
        its name from this; and there is matter in everything which is
        generated; and that this is this and that is that.
      </p>
      <p>
        613. The problem, then, is as follows: is there a. sphere apart from
        these particular spheres, or a house apart from bricks, or one that has
        never been produced? Now if this were true, no particular thing would
        exist. But since house means what is such and such, it is not a definite
        thing, yet the agent makes and generates something that is such and such
        from this. And when this has been generated it is such and such a
        particular thing; and this whole particular thing, such as Callias or
        Socrates, is like a brazen sphere, but man and animal are like brazen
        sphere in general. It is evident, then, that the cause which consists of
        the Forms, in the sense in which some are accustomed to speak of them,
        i.e., supposing that they do exist apart from singular things, is
        useless so far as processes of generation and substances are concerned.
        Nor will the Forms be, for this reason, substances existing by
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        614. And in some cases it is evident that the thing which generates is
        of the same kind as the thing which is generated, although they are not
        the same numerically but specifically, for example, in the case of
        natural generations (for man begets man), unless something contrary to
        nature is generated, as when a horse begets a mule. And even these cases
        are alike; for what is common both to horse and ass as their proximate
        genus has no name, but perhaps both might be something like mule. Hence
        there is evidently no need to furnish a Form as an exemplar; for men
        would have searched for Forms especially in sensible things, since these
        are substances in the highest degree. But the thing which generates is
        adequate for producing the thing and for causing the form in the matter.
        And when the whole is such and such a form in this flesh and these
        bones, this is Callias or Socrates; and they differ in their matter (for
        the matter of each is different) but are the same in form, because form
        is indivisible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1417. The Philosopher posited above certain points about processes of
        generation in the world as prerequisites for proving his thesis, namely,
        to show that the causes of the generation of things must not be held to
        be separate Forms. And since two of these have already been made clear
        in the foregoing discussion, i.e., that every process of generation is
        from matter, and that everything which is generated is generated by
        something similar to itself, he now aims to prove his thesis from the
        questions which were investigated above.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is divided into two parts. In the first (611:C 1417) he shows what
        things are generated. In the second (613:C 1427) he shows that the cause
        of generation is not a separate Form (“The problem, then”). In the third
        (615:C 1436) he clears up certain things which could be considered as
        problems pertaining to the points already established (“However,
        someone”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First (611), he shows that a
        form is generated only accidentally; and second (612:C 1424), that it is
        a composite thing which is generated (“But he does make”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (611), that the points explained above are
        true. The first of these is that everything which comes to be, comes to
        be by something, and this is the agent or generator, which is the
        principle of generation; and the second is that everything which comes
        to be, comes to be from something, and by this something from which
        generation takes place we mean the matter and not the privation. For it
        was said above that something comes to be from matter in a different way
        than it does from a privation. The third point is that in every process
        of generation there must be something which comes to be; and this is
        either a sphere or a circle or something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        1418. From the things which have been posited it ought to be evident
        that, just as an agent does not produce the matter or subject of
        generation, for example, the bronze, when he generates something, so too
        “neither does he produce the form,” namely, the thing itself which is a
        sphere, except perhaps accidentally; for he makes a brazen sphere, which
        is a composite. And since a brazen sphere is also a sphere, he therefore
        accidentally produces a sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        1419. Now the fact that the agent does not produce the matter is evident
        of itself, because matter is prior to the act of making. Hence it was
        not necessary for Aristotle to prove that matter is not generated.
        However, regarding forms there could be a difficulty, because a form is
        found only at the termination of an activity; and therefore it was
        necessary for him to prove that a form is produced only accidentally.
        And the reason is that forms do not have being, properly speaking, but
        are rather the principles by which things have being. Hence if the,
        process of coming to be is the way to being, only those things properly
        come to be which have being by their forms; and forms begin to be in the
        sense that they exist in the things generated, which have being by these
        forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        1420. The proof that forms are not generated is as follows. To make this
        particular thing is to make it from a subject, and this is “totally,”
        i.e., universally, true of every generation. For to make what is bronze
        round is not to make “round” itself, i.e., roundness, or “sphere”
        itself, namely, the form of a sphere, but to make “something else,”
        namely, a form, not in any way whatever, “but in something else,”
        namely, in matter; and this is to make the composite. This is made
        evident as follows. If an agent makes something, he must make it from
        something else as its matter. And “this was assumed above,” namely, that
        every process of generation is from matter, because of the proof adduced
        above; as an agent, for example, is said to make a brazen sphere. And
        this is true because he makes the thing which is a brazen sphere from
        bronze. Hence, if he also makes the form itself, it is clear that he
        will make it in the same way, namely, from some matter. And thus just as
        a brazen sphere will be composed of matter and form, so also will the
        form of brazen sphere be composed of matter and form; and the same
        question will be raised in turn about the form of this form, and so on
        to infinity; and in this way processes of generation will proceed to
        infinity, because everything generated has matter and form. It is
        evident, then, that the form of the thing generated does not come to be;
        and neither does any other thing, whatever it may be, which must be
        called a form in sensible things, for example, order, combination and
        shape, which has the character of a form in some things, especially in
        those made by art.
      </p>
      <p>
        1421. And since generation pertains to the thing generated, it is
        evident that it is not the form that is generated but the composite. And
        so too the essence of the thing generated is not itself generated,
        except accidentally; for the form or essence “is what comes to be in
        something else,” i.e., in matter, but not of itself. And I say that it
        comes to be either by art, by nature “or by power,” i.e., by anything
        that acts by violence (C 841).
      </p>
      <p>
        1422. Now he says that the essence of a thing is not generated, even
        though it is the same as the thing generated; for it was shown above
        (591:C 1362) that each thing is the same as its own essence. But the
        essence of a thing refers properly to its form. Hence individual
        conditions, which pertain to a form accidentally, are excluded from it.
        And species and other universals are generated only accidentally when
        singular things are generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        1423. Yet it must be noted that even though it is said in the text that
        form comes to be in matter, this is not a proper way of speaking; for it
        is not a form that comes to be, but a composite. For a form is said to
        exist in matter, although a form does not [properly] exist, but a
        composite exists by its form. Thus the proper way of speaking is to say
        that a composite is generated from matter according to such and such a
        form. For forms are not generated, properly speaking, but are brought
        from the potency of matter, inasmuch as matter, which is in potentiality
        to form, becomes actual under some form; and this is to produce a
        composite.
      </p>
      <p>
        1424. <span style="font-weight: bold">But he does make</span> (612).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that it is composite things which are generated. He says
        that an agent does make a sphere to be; for he makes it from bronze,
        which is the matter, as the principle of generation, and from sphere,
        which is the form and terminus of generation. For he causes “this form,”
        i.e., the figure of a sphere, “in this,” i.e., in the matter, in the
        sense that he changes this bronze into a sphere, and this is a brazen
        sphere, or the form of a sphere in bronze.
      </p>
      <p>
        1425. “But this,” namely, the figure of a sphere, “is the being of a
        sphere,” i.e., the whatness of a sphere. “But of the being of sphere in
        general,” i.e., of the whatness of the form, there is no generation
        whatever, because if it were generated it would have to be generated
        from something as its matter. For everything which comes to be must be
        divisible, so that “this is this,” i.e., one part of it is this, “and
        that is that,” i.e., another part is that. He explains this by saying
        that one part of it is matter and the other, form. Hence, if the
        whatness of a sphere in reference to the form itself is “that it is a
        figure everywhere equidistant from a center,” i.e., that it is a certain
        solid figure of which all lines drawn from the center to the
        circumference are equal, then “one part,” i.e., the matter “of this,”
        namely, of a brazen sphere, must be that in which “the thing produced
        will exist,” namely, the matter, and the other will be what exists in
        this, namely, the form, which is the figure everywhere equidistant from
        a center, and “this is all,” i.e., the whole, “that has been produced,”
        namely, a brazen sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        1426. Hence it is evident from our remarks that, if everything which
        comes to be must be divisible, the part which is called the form or
        “substance,” i.e., the essence, does not come to be; but it is “the
        concrete whole,” or the composite, which is spoken of and gets its name
        from such a form or quiddity or whatness which comes to be. Again, it is
        evident that matter is found in everything which is generated, and that
        of everything which is generated “this is this and that is that,” i.e.,
        one part is matter and the other is form.
      </p>
      <p>
        1427. <span style="font-weight: bold">The problem, then</span> (613).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since it is not forms which are generated but composite things, he shows
        that it is not necessary to posit separate Forms as the causes of
        generation in these lower bodies. And it must be understood that the
        Platonists claimed that separate Forms cause generation in two ways:
        first, after the manner of a generator, and, second, after the manner of
        an exemplar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence he shows, first (613), that separate Forms are not causes of
        generation after the manner of a generator; and second (614:C 1432),
        that they are not causes after the manner of an exemplar (“And in some
        cases”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (613), that it is necessary to consider
        whether there is a form “which is universal’ and exists apart from
        singular forms of this kind,” i.e., whether there is a sphere without
        matter apart from these spheres found in matter; or again whether there
        is a universal house without matter apart from the bricks of which these
        particular houses are made. Now he raises the question with reference to
        artificial things in order to throw light on natural ones, whose forms
        the Platonists claimed to be separate from matter; so that the question
        is understood to be whether there is a universal man apart from the
        flesh and bones of which individual men are composed.
      </p>
      <p>
        1428. And for the purpose of answering this question he posits here
        that, if any substance is produced in this way, it will not be a
        particular thing in any sense, but will only signify such and such a
        thing, which is not a definite individual. For Socrates signifies this
        particular thing and a definite individual, but man signifies such and
        such a thing, because it signifies a common and indefinite form, since
        it signifies without the definiteness of a this or a that. Hence, if
        there should be a man separate from Socrates and Plato and other
        individuals of this kind, it will still be a particular or definite
        thing. But in processes of generation we see that the thing which makes
        and generates something “from this,” i.e., from some particular matter,
        is “such and such a particular thing,” i.e., this definite thing having
        a definite form; for just as the thing generated must be a particular
        thing, so also must the thing which generates it be a particular thing,
        since the thing generated is similar to the thing which generates it, as
        was proved above (603:C 1390. Now that the thing generated is a
        particular thing is clear from the fact that it is a composite. “And
        this being,” i.e., the composite, when it is “such and such a thing,”
        i.e., a definite thing, is like Callias or Socrates, just as when we
        speak of this brazen sphere. But man and animal do not signify this
        matter from which generation proceeds, and neither does brazen sphere,
        taken universally. Therefore, if the composite is generated, and it is
        generated only from this matter whereby it is this particular thing,
        then what is generated must be a particular thing. And since the thing
        generated is similar to the one generating it, the latter must also be a
        particular thing. Hence there is no universal form without matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1429. It is therefore evident from what has been said that, if there are
        any forms separate from singular things, they are of no use for the
        generations and substances of things, just as some are accustomed to
        speak of “the cause which consists of the Forms,” intending thus to
        posit such forms. For one reason why the Platonists posited separate
        Forms was that they might be the cause of processes of generation in the
        world. Hence, if separate Forms cannot be the cause of generation, it is
        evident that forms will not be certain substances existing by
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        1430. And it must be noted that all those who have failed to consider
        what the Philosopher proved above-that forms do not come to be-face the
        same difficulty with regard to the production of forms, because it was
        for this reason that some men were compelled to say that all forms are
        created; for while they held that forms come to be, they could not hold
        that they come from matter since matter is not a part of form; and
        therefore they concluded that forms come from nothing, and,
        consequently, that they are created. But because of this difficulty, on
        the other hand, some men claimed that forms actually pre-exist in
        matter, and this is to suppose that forms are hidden, as Anaxagoras
        maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
        1431. Now the view of Aristotle, who claimed that forms are not
        generated but only composite things, excludes both of these other
        opinions. For it is not necessary to say that forms are caused by some
        external agent, or that they will always be present in matter actually,
        but only potentially, and that in the generation of the composite they
        are brought from potentiality to actuality.
      </p>
      <p>
        1432. <span style="font-weight: bold">And in some cases</span> (614).
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows that separate Forms cannot be the cause of the generation of
        things after the manner of an exemplar. He says that even though in some
        cases one may encounter the problem whether the generator is similar to
        the thing generated, still in the case of some things it is evident that
        the generator is of the same kind as the thing generated: not
        numerically the same but specifically, as is clear in the case of
        natural beings; for man begets man, and similarly a horse begets a
        horse, and each natural thing produces something similar to itself in
        species, unless something beyond nature happens to result, as when a
        horse begets a mule. And this generation is beyond nature, because it is
        outside of the aim of a particular nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        1433. For the formative power, which is in the sperm of the male, is
        designed by nature to produce something completely the same as that from
        which the sperm has been separated; but its secondary aim, when it
        cannot induce a perfect likeness, is to induce any kind of likeness that
        it can. And since in the generation of a mule the sperm of a horse
        cannot induce the form of a horse in the matter, because it is not
        adapted to receive the form of a horse, it therefore induces a related
        form. Hence in the generation of a mule the generator is similar in a
        way to the thing generated; for there is a proximate genus, which lacks
        a name, common to horse and to ass; and mule is also contained under
        that genus. Hence in reference to that genus it can be said that like
        generates like; for example, if we might say that that proximate genus
        is beast of burden, we could say that, even though a horse does not
        generate a horse but a mule, still a beast of burden generates a beast
        of burden.
      </p>
      <p>
        1434. Hence it is evident that everything which is generated receives
        the likeness of its form from the power of the thing generating it. And
        for this reason it is obviously not necessary to posit some separate
        Form, as the exemplar of the things which are generated, from whose
        image the things generated receive a similar form, as the Platonists
        claimed. For exemplars of this kind are especially necessary in the case
        of the natural substances mentioned above, which are substances to a
        greater degree when compared with artificial things. Now in the case of
        the foregoing substances the generator is sufficient to cause a likeness
        of form; and it is enough to maintain that the generator causes the form
        in the matter, i.e., that the thing which causes the thing generated to
        receive such a form is not some form outside of matter but a form in
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1435. “And every form” which is in the matter, namely, “in this flesh
        and these bones,” is some singular thing, such as Callias or Socrates.
        And this form which causes a likeness in species in the process of
        generation, also differs numerically from the form of the thing
        generated because of difference in matter; for material diversity is the
        principle of diversity among individuals in the same species; for the
        matter containing the form of the man who begets and that of the man who
        is begotten are different. But both forms are the same in species; for
        the form itself is “indivisible,” i.e., it does not differ in the one
        who generates and in the one who is generated. Hence it follows that it
        is not necessary to posit a form apart from singular things, which
        causes the form in the things generated, as the Platonists claimed.<br /></p

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 9: 1034a 9-1034b 19
      </p>
      <p>
        615. However, someone might raise the question why some things come to
        be both by art and by chance, as health, while others do not, as a
        house.
      </p>
      <p>
        616. And the reason is that in some of these the matter, which is the
        principle of generation in the making and producing of everything which
        comes to be by art, and in which some part of the thing made is present,
        the matter of these, I say, is such that it can set itself in motion,
        whereas the matters of others cannot. And of the former kind some can
        set itself is motion in a special way, and some cannot; for many things
        can move themselves but not in some special way, as in dancing. Those
        things, then, whose matter is of such a kind, for instance, stones, can
        only be moved by something else. Yet in another way they can move
        themselves, as in the case of fire. And for this reason some things will
        not exist apart from one who possesses an art, while others will; for
        they will be moved either by those things which do not have art or by
        those which have it in part.
      </p>
      <p>
        617. And it is evident from what has been said that in a sense all
        things come from something which is univocal (as natural things), or
        from something which is univocal in part (as a house comes from a house,
        or by means of mind; for art is a form), or from a part or from
        something having a part, unless it comes to be accidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        618. For the first and pioper cause of the production of anything is a
        part of the thing produced; for the heat in the motion produces heat in
        the body; and this is either health or a part of health, or some part of
        health or health itself follows from it. Hence it is said to cause
        health, because it causes that from which health follows, and of which
        health is an accident. Hence, just as in syllogisms the basis of
        everything is substance (for a syllogism proceeds from the whatness of a
        thing), so too in this case processes of generation proceed from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        619. And those things which are constituted by nature are similar to
        these; for the seed produces something in the same way as things which
        operate by art; for it contains the form potentially, and that from
        which the seed comes [and the thing which it generates] are in a sense
        univocal, for it is not necessary to inquire about all things in the
        same way as we do when we say that a man comes from a man; for a woman
        also comes from a man. Hence a mule does not come from a mule, unless
        there should be some defect. And whatever things arise by chance, as
        some artificial things do, are those whose matter can be moved by itself
        by the very motion by which the seed moves. But those things whose
        matter does not possess this capacity cannot be generated in any other
        way than by the agents themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        620. Now it is not only with reference to substance that our argument
        proves that the spccifying principle does not come to be, but the common
        reasoning also applies in a similar way to all the primary genera, such
        as quantity, quality and the other categories. For a brazen sphere as
        such comes to be, but not the sphere or the bronze, but if it does come
        to be, it comes to be in the bronze (because it is always necessary that
        the form and the matter pre-exist). This must also be the case with the
        quiddity, with quality, with quantity, and also with the other
        categories; for quality does not come to be, but wood of such a quality;
        and quantity does not come to be, but so much wood or so large an
        animal.
      </p>
      <p>
        621. But from these remarks it is possible to learn a property of
        substance, namely, that there must always pre-exist another actual
        substance which produces it; for example, an animal must pre-exist if an
        animal is generated. But quantity and quality must pre-exist only
        potentially.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1436. Having shown that separate forms are not the cause of generation
        in these lower bodies, the Philosopher now clears up certain things
        which could be regarded as problems relating to the points already
        established. This is divided into three parts insofar as there are three
        problems which he intends to clear up. The second part (617:C 1443)
        begins where he says “And it is evident”; and the third (620:C 1458), at
        the words, “Now it is not only.” In regard to the first he does two
        things. First (615:C 1436), he states the problem. Second (616:C 1437),
        he solves it (“And the reason”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the first problem stems from a statement which he had made above
        (609:C 1412) to the effect that, when the principle of health is the
        form in the mind, health is then a result of art; but when health is not
        a result of this principle but only of the act of heating, health then
        comes about by chance, for example, when health happens to result from a
        vigorous rubbing. But this cannot be true of everything that comes to be
        by art; for a house is never produced by any principle except the form
        of a house in the mind, and thus it will always come to be by art and
        never by chance. Hence the problem is why some things, for instance,
        health, sometimes come to be by art and sometimes by chance, while
        others, for instance, a house, come to be only by art and never by
        chance.
      </p>
      <p>1437. <span style="font-weight: bold">And the reason</span> (616).</p>
      <p>
        He then solves the problem. He says that the reason for the
        above-mentioned difference in the case of artificial things lies in the
        fact that the matter from which generation begins, inasmuch as it is the
        basis of the making and producing any of the things which come about by
        art, is such as to contain some part of the thing generated. For the
        matter must have some aptitude for form, because not any artifact can be
        produced from any matter, but each from some definite matter; for
        example, a saw is not produced from wool but from iron. Hence the
        aptitude itself of the artifact for a form, which is in the matter, is
        already some part of the artifact which is in the matter; because
        without this aptitude the artifact cannot exist; for instance, there
        cannot be a saw without hardness, by which the iron is disposed for the
        form of a saw.
      </p>
      <p>
        1438. But this part is found in matter in two ways: sometimes in such a
        way that the matter can move itself by this part, i.e., by the part of
        the form existing within it, and sometimes not. For example, in the case
        of the human body, which is the matter of health, there is an active
        power by which the body can heal itself, but in the case of stones and
        timbers there is no active power by which the matter can be moved to
        receive the form of a house.
      </p>
      <p>
        1439. And if the matter can be so moved to receive a form by a part of
        the form which exists in it, this can occur in two ways. For sometimes
        it can be moved by an intrinsic principle, which is the part mentioned
        above, in the same way in which it is moved by art, as occurs in the
        restoration of health; for the nature of the human body acts in the same
        way with regard to health as art does. But sometimes the matter cannot
        be moved by an intrinsic principle in the same way in which it is moved
        by art, although it can be moved by itself in some way. For there are
        many things which can be moved by themselves, but not in the same way in
        which they are moved by art, as is clear in the case of dancing. For men
        who do not have the art of dancing can move about tut not in the way in
        which those men do who have this art.
      </p>
      <p>
        1440. Therefore those artificial things which have this kind of nature,
        such as a house made of bricks, cannot set themselves in motion; for
        they cannot be moved unless they are moved by something else. This is
        true not only of artificial things but also of natural ones; for in this
        way too the matter of fire cannot be moved to receive the form of fire
        unless it is moved by something else. And it is for this reason that the
        form of fire is generated only by something else. Hence it follows that
        some artificial things cannot come to be unless there is something which
        possesses art, i.e., those which do not have in their matter any
        principle which can move their matter to receive a form, or which cannot
        cause motion in the way in which art does.
      </p>
      <p>
        1441. And those things which can be moved by some extrinsic principle
        which is not possessed of art, can both be and come to be without the
        intervention of art; for the matters of these are moved by things which
        do not possess art. He makes this clear in two ways: first, by pointing
        out that this can happen insofar as they can be moved by certain other
        extrinsic principles which do not possess art; and second, when “the
        matter is moved by a part” [i.e., of the composite] namely, by some
        intrinsic principle, which is some part of the form, for example, when
        health is restored to the human body by some intrinsic principle which
        is a part of the form.
      </p>
      <p>
        1442a. Now it must be noted that some persons, because of the words
        which are used here, claim that in every natural generation the matter
        contains some active principle, which is the form pre-existing
        potentially in the matter and a kind of beginning of form; and thus it
        is called a part of the form. And they try to establish this, first,
        from the statements made here; for Aristotle seems to say here that
        those things whose matter contains no active principle are produced by
        art alone; and therefore they think that some active principle must be
        present in the matter of things which are generated by nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        1442b. Second, they try to establish this from the fact that every
        motion whose principle is not intrinsic to the thing moved but extrinsic
        to it is a violent motion and not a natural one. For if there were no
        active principle in the matter of those things which are generated by
        nature, the process of generation of these things would not be natural
        but violent; or, in other words, there would be no difference between
        artificial generations and natural ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        1442c. And when one argues against them that, if the generation of those
        things which come about by nature is from an intrinsic principle, such
        things do not therefore stand in need of any extrinsic generator, their
        answer is: just as an intrinsic principle is not a perfect form but a
        kind of beginning of form, neither is it a perfect active principle in
        the sense that it can act of itself so as to bring about generation; but
        it bears some likeness to an active power inasmuch as it cooperates with
        an extrinsic agent. For if the mobile object contributes nothing to the
        motion produced by an external agent, the motion is violent; because
        violence exists when the thing undergoing the change is moved by an
        extrinsic principle and does not itself contribute anything to the
        change, as is stated in Book III of the <i>Ethics</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        1442d. Now this opinion seems to resemble the one expressed by those who
        claim that forms lie hidden; for since a thing acts only insofar as it
        is actual, if the parts or beginnings of the forms which exist in matter
        have some active power, it follows that they are actual to some degree;
        and this is to maintain that forms lie hidden. Furthermore, since being
        is prior to action, a form cannot be understood to act before it
        actually exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        1442e. Therefore it must be said that, just as living things alone are
        found to move themselves locally, whereas other things are moved by an
        extrinsic principle, i.e., either by one which generates or which
        removes some obstacle, as is stated in Book VIII of the <i>Physics</i>,
        so too only living things are found to move themselves with the other
        motions. This is because they are found to have different parts, one of
        which can be a mover and the other something moved; and this must be
        true of everything that moves itself, as is proved in Book VIII of the
        <i>Physics</i>. Hence in the generation of living things we find an
        intrinsic efficient principle, which is the formative power in the seed.
        And just as living things have a power of growth, which is responsible
        for the motion of increase and decrease, in a similar fashion they have
        an intrinsic motive principle responsible for the qualitative change of
        being healed. For since the heart is not subject to disease, the natural
        power which is present in it, as in something healthy, changes the whole
        body to a state of health.
      </p>
      <p>
        1442f. Hence the Philosopher is speaking here of such matter as has an
        efficient principle within itself, and not of inanimate things. This is
        clear from the fact that he compares the matter of fire with the matter
        of a house in this respect, that both are moved to receive their form by
        an extrinsic principle. It does not follow, however, that the process
        whereby inanimate bodies are generated is not natural; for in order to
        have natural motion it is not necessary that the principle of motion
        present in the thing moved should always be an active and formal
        principle; but sometimes it is passive and material. Hence in Book II of
        the <i>Physics</i> nature is distinguished into matter and form. And the
        natural generation of simple bodies is said to proceed from this
        principle, as the Commentator says in his commentary on Book II of the
        <i>Physics</i>. Yet there is a difference between the matter of natural
        things and that of things made by art, because in the matter of natural
        things there is a natural aptitude for form, and this can be brought to
        actuality by a natural agent; but this does not occur in the matter of
        things made by art.
      </p>
      <p>
        1443. <span style="font-weight: bold">And it is evident</span> (617).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he clears up the second problem which could arise from the
        foregoing discussion; for he had said above (614:C 1432) that everything
        which is generated is generated by something having a similar form. Now
        this does not apply in the same way to all things, and therefore he
        intends here to clarify how this applies in a different way to different
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to this he does two things. First, he distinguishes the
        different ways in which the thing generated is like the thing which
        generates it. Second (618:C 1448), he explains these ways (“For the
        first”).
      </p>
      <p>
        With regard to the first (617) it must be noted that everything which is
        generated by something is generated by it either properly or
        accidentally. Now whatever is generated by something accidentally is not
        generated by it according as it is a thing of some special kind. Hence
        in the generator there does not have to be any likeness of the thing
        generated; for example, the discovery of a treasure has no likeness in
        him who, when he digs in order to plant something, discovers the
        treasure accidentally. But a generator in the proper sense generates
        something of the same kind as itself. Hence in a proper generator the
        likeness of the thing generated must exist in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
        1444. But this comes about in three ways: First, when the form of the
        thing generated pre-exists in the generator according to the same mode
        of being, and in a similar matter, as when fire generates fire or man
        begets man. This type of generation is wholly univocal.
      </p>
      <p>
        1445. Second, when the form of the thing generated pre-exists in the
        generator, neither according to the same mode of being, nor in a
        substance of the same kind; for example, the form of a house pre-exists
        in the builder, not with the material being which it has in the stones
        and timbers, but with the immaterial being which it has in the mind of
        the builder. This type of generation is partly univocal, from the
        standpoint of form, and partly equivocal, from the standpoint of the
        being of the form in the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        1446. Third, when the whole form of the thing generated does not
        preexist in the generator, but only some part of it or a part of a part;
        as in the medicine which has been heated there pre-exists the heat which
        is a part of health, or something leading to a part of health. This type
        of generation is not univocal in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
        1447. Hence he says, “It is evident from what has been said that in a
        sense all things come from something which is totally univocal, as
        natural things,” for example, fire comes from fire, and a man from a
        man; or it comes from something which is univocal “in part,” in
        reference to the form, and equivocal in part, in reference to the being
        which the form has in the subject; for example, a house comes from the
        house which is the art in the builder, “or by means of mind,” or by a
        habit of art; for the building art is the form of the house. Or in a
        third way some things come from the form pre-existing in the generator,
        or from the generator himself who possesses a part of the
        above-mentioned form. For the process of generation can be said to be a
        result either of the form or of a part of the form, or of something
        having the form or a part of the form; but it comes from something
        having the form as from a generator, and from the form or a part of the
        form as from something by which the generator generates; for it is not
        the form that generates or acts, but the thing having the form generates
        and acts by means of it. By this I mean that a thing is generated by
        something like itself in the ways mentioned above, unless it comes about
        in an accidental way; for then it is not necessary that any likeness of
        this kind should be observed, as has been explained (C 1443).
      </p>
      <p>1448. <span style="font-weight: bold">For the first</span> (618).</p>
      <p>
        Here he explains the ways mentioned above in which one thing comes from
        something else. He does this first in the case of artificial things; and
        second (619:C 1451), in the case of natural ones (“And those things
        which”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (618), that the thing produced must come from
        some part, because the first and proper cause of the production of
        anything produced is the part of it which preexists in the one producing
        it, and which is either the form itself of the producer or a part of the
        form. For when heat is caused by motion, heat is present in a sense in
        the motion itself as in an active power; for the power of causing heat
        which is in the motion is itself something belonging to the genus of
        heat; and the heat which is present virtually in the motion causes the
        heat in the body, not by a univocal generation but by an equivocal one;
        for the heat in the motion and that in the heated body are not of
        exactly the same nature. But heat is either health itself or some part
        of health, or it is accompanied by some part of health or health itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        1449. Now by these four alternatives which he gives he wants us to
        understand the four modes in which the form of the thing causing
        generation can be referred to the form of the thing generated. The first
        of these is found when the form of the thing generated is totally in the
        thing which causes generation; as the form of a house is in the mind of
        the master builder, and the form of the fire which is generated is in
        the fire which generates it. The second mode is found when a part of the
        form of the thing generated is in the thing causing generation, as when
        a hot medicine restores health by heating; for the heat produced in the
        one who is being healed is a part of health. The third mode is found
        when part of the form is in the thing causing generation, not actually
        but virtually, as when motion restores health by heating; for heat is
        present in the motion virtually but not actually. The fourth mode is
        found when the whole form itself is present virtually but not actually
        in the thing which causes generation; for example, the form of numbness
        is in the eel which makes the hand numb. And it is similar in the case
        of other things which act by means of the whole form. Therefore he
        refers to the first mode by the words “Either health”; to the second
        mode, by the words “or a part”; to the third, by the words “or some part
        of health follows from it”; and to the fourth, by the words “or health
        itself.” And since motion causes the heat from which health follows, for
        this reason too motion is said to cause health, because that causes
        health from which health follows or ensues. Or better “that which
        follows from and happens as a result of motion,” namely, heat, causes
        health.
      </p>
      <p>
        1450. Hence it is evident that, just as in syllogisms the basis of all
        demonstrations “is substance,” i.e., the whatness (for demonstrative
        syllogisms proceed from the whatness of a thing, since the middle term
        in demonstrations is a definition), “so too in this case,” namely, in
        matters of operation, processes of generation proceed from the quiddity.
        In this statement the likeness of the speculative intellect to the
        practical intellect is shown; for just as the speculative intellect
        proceeds to demonstrate the properties of subjects from a study of their
        quiddity, in a similar fashion the intellect proceeds from the form of
        the work, which is its quiddity, as was stated above.
      </p>
      <p>
        1451. <span style="font-weight: bold">And those things</span> (619).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he explains his statement about artificial things in their
        application to natural things. He says that those things which are
        constituted by nature are similar to those which come to be by art; for
        the seed acts for the purpose of generating, and this is what happens in
        the case of things which come to be by art; for just as a master builder
        is not a house actually and does not possess the form which constitutes
        a house actually but only potentially, so too the seed is not an animal
        actually, nor does it possess a soul actually, which is the form of an
        animal, but only potentially. For in the seed there is a formative power
        which is related to the matter of the thing conceived in the same way in
        which the form of the house in the mind of the builder is related to the
        stones and timbers; but there is this difference: the form of an art is
        wholly extrinsic to the stones and timbers, whereas the power of the
        seed is present in the seed itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        1452. Now although the generation of an animal from seed does not
        proceed from the seed as from something univocal, since the seed is not
        an animal, still that from which the seed comes is in some measure
        univocal with the thing which comes from it; for the seed comes from an
        animal. And in this respect natural generation bears no likeness to
        artificial generation; because it is not necessary for the form of the
        house in the mind of the master builder to come from a house, although
        this sometimes happens, as when someone makes a plan of one house from
        that of another. But it is always necessary for seed to come from an
        animal.
      </p>
      <p>
        1453. Moreover, he explains what he meant by the phrase “in a sense
        univocal,” because in natural generations it is not necessary that there
        should always be univocity in every respect, as there is when a man is
        said to come from a man, “for a woman comes from a man” as an agent; and
        a mule does not come from a mule, but from a horse or an ass, and in
        this case there is some likeness, as he said above (614:C 1433)Further,
        since he had said that there must be univocity to some degree because of
        that from which the seed comes, he adds that this must be understood
        “unless there should be some defect,” i.e., unless there is some
        shortcoming of natural power in the seed; for then the generator
        produces something which is not similar to itself, as is evident in the
        birth of monsters.
      </p>
      <p>
        1454. And “just as in those,” ‘ i.e., in artificial things, some come to
        be not only by art but also by chance, when the matter can be moved by
        itself by the same motion according to which it is moved by art (but
        when it cannot be moved in this way, then that which comes to be by art
        cannot be produced by anything else than art), so too in this case some
        things can come to be by chance and without seed, whose matter can be
        moved by itself in this way “by the motion by which the seed moves,”
        i.e., with the aim of generating an animal. This is evident in the case
        of those things which are generated from decay, and which are said in
        one sense to be a result of chance, and in another not, as was explained
        above (C 1403). But those things whose matter cannot be moved by itself
        by that very motion by which the seed is moved, are incapable of being
        generated in another way than from their own seed; and this is evident
        in the case of man and horse and other perfect animals. Now it is clear
        from what is said here that not all animals can be generated both from
        seed and without seed, as Avicenna claims, and that none can be
        generated in both ways, as Averroes claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        1455. Now it must be observed that from what has been said here it is
        possible to solve the problems facing those who claim that the forms
        generated in these lower bodies do not derive their being from natural
        generators but from forms which exist apart from matter. For they seem
        to maintain this position chiefly because of those living things which
        are generated from decay, whose forms do not seem to come from anything
        that is similar to them in form. And again since even in animals which
        are generated from seed the active power of generation, which is in the
        seed, is not a soul, they said that the soul of the animal which is
        generated cannot come from the seed. And they proceed to argue thus
        because they think that no active principle of generation is found in
        these lower bodies except heat and cold, which are accidental forms, and
        it does not seem that substantial forms can be generated by means of
        these. Nor does it seem that the argument which the Philosopher used
        against those who posited separate exemplars, holds in all cases, so
        that the forms in things causing generation are sufficient to account
        for the likeness of form in the things which are generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        1456. But all these difficulties are solved by the text of Aristotle if
        it is examined carefully. For it is said in the text that the active
        power in the seed, even though it is not an animal actually, is
        nevertheless an animal virtually. Hence just as the form of a house in
        matter can come from the form of house in the mind, so too a complete
        soul can come from the power in the seed, exclusive of the intellect,
        which is from an extrinsic principle, as is said in Book XVI of
        <i>Animals</i>. And this is true inasmuch as the power in the seed comes
        from a complete soul by whose power it acts; for intermediate principles
        act by virtue of primary principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        1457. Now in the matter of those things which are generated from decay
        there also exists a principle which is similar to the active power in
        the seed, by which the soul of such animals is caused. And just as the
        power in the seed comes from the complete soul of the animal and from
        the power of a celestial body, in a similar fashion the power of
        generating an animal which exists in decayed matter is from a celestial
        body alone, in which all forms of things which are generated are present
        virtually as in their active principle. And even though active qualities
        are operative, they do not act by their own power but by virtue of their
        substantial forms to which they are related as instruments; as it is
        said in Book II of <i>The Soul</i> that the heat of fire is like an
        instrument of the nutritive soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        1458. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now it is not only</span> (620).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he clears up the third problem that could arise from his remarks;
        for he had proved above that it is not forms which are generated but
        composite things, and someone could be puzzled whether this is true only
        of substantia I forms or also of accidental forms. So his aim here is to
        meet this problem, and therefore he does two things. First, he shows
        that this is true of both types of forms. He says that the argument
        given above “with reference to substance,” i.e., the category of
        substance, not only shows that the “specifying principle,” or form, does
        not come to be, but is common in a similar way “to all genera,” i.e., to
        the categories, such as quantity and quality and so on. “For a brazen
        sphere as such comes to be,” i.e., a composite such as a brazen sphere,
        “but not the sphere,” i.e., what has the character of a form, “or the
        bronze,” i.e., what has the character of matter. And if a sphere does
        come to be in some manner of speaking, it does not come to be in itself,
        but comes to be in bronze; because, in order for generation to take
        place the matter and the form must pre-exist, as was shown above
        (599-602:C 1383-88). Thus it is “a brazen sphere as such,” namely, the
        composite, which comes to be, “and this must also be the case with the
        quiddity,” i.e., the category of substance, and with quality and
        quantity, and also with the other categories. For “quality” does not
        come to be, i.e., quality itself, but this whole which is “wood of such
        a quality”nor does “quantity” come to be, i.e.: quantity itself, but so
        much wood or so large an animal.
      </p>
      <p>
        1459.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But from these remarks</span> (621).
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows what the difference is between substance and accidents. He says
        that we must take this characteristic to be a property of substance as
        compared with accidents, namely, that when a substance is generated
        there must always exist another substance which causes its generation;
        for example, in the case of animals generated from seed, if an animal is
        generated, another animal which generates it must pre-exist. But in the
        case of quantity and quality and the other accidents it is not necessary
        that these pre-exist actually but only potentially, and this is the
        material principle and subject of motion. For the active principle of a
        substance can only be a substance; but the active principle of accidents
        can be something which is not an accident, namely, a substance.<br /></p

        and every intelligible expression has parts, and just as the
        intelligible expression is related to the thing, so is a part of the
        intelligible expression to a part of the thing, the problem now arises
        whether the intelligible expression of the parts must be present in the
        intelligible expression of the whole or not; for in some cases they seem
        to be and in others they do not, for the intelligible expression of a
        circle does not include that of its segments [but the intelligible
        expression of a syllable includes that of its letters], yet a circle is
        divided into segments as a syllable is into elements.

        623. Further, if parts are prior to a whole, and an acute angle is a
        part of a right angle, and a finger a part of a man, an acute angle will
        be prior to a right angle, and a finger prior to a man. However, the
        latter seem to be prior; for in the intelligible expression the parts
        are explained from them; and wholes are prior because they can exist
        without a part.
      </p>
      <p>
        624. Or perhaps it happens that the term part is used in many senses,
        one of which is what measures a thing quantitatively. But let us dismiss
        this sense of the term and inquire about those things which constitute
        the parts of which substance is composed. Now if matter is one of these,
        and form another, and the thing composed of these a third, then there is
        one sense in which even matter is called a part of a thing, and there is
        another in which it is not, but only those things of which the
        intelligible expression or specifying principle consists. For example,
        flesh is not a part of concavity, because flesh is the matter in which
        concavity is produced; but it is a part of snubness. And bronze is a
        part of the whole statue, but it is not a part of the statue in the
        sense of form; for predications must be made according to a thing’s form
        and insofar as each thing has a form, but the material principle should
        never be predicated of a thing essentially. And this is why the
        intelligible expression of a circle does not contain that of its
        segments, whereas the intelligible expression of a syllable does contain
        that of its letters; for the letters are parts of the intelligible
        expression of the form, and are not matter. But segments of this kind
        are parts of the matter in which the form is produced, yet they are more
        akin to the form than bronze is when roundness is produced in bronze.
        However, not all the elements of a syllable will be contained in its
        intelligible expression; for example, the letters inscribed in wax or
        produced in the air; for these are already parts of the syllable as its
        sensible matter. For even if a line when divided is dissolved into
        halves, or a man into bones and sinews and flesh, it does not follow for
        this reason that they are composed of these as parts of their substance,
        but as their matter; and these are parts of the concrete whole, but not
        of the specifying principle, or of that to which the intelligible
        expression belongs. Hence they are not included in the intelligible
        expression of these things. Therefore in some cases the intelligible
        expression of a thing will include that of such parts as those
        mentioned, but in other cases it need not include them unless taken
        together they constitute the intelligible expression of the thing. For
        it is by reason of this that some things are composed of these as the
        principles into which they are dissolved, while others are not. Hence
        all things which are matter and form taken together, as snub and brazen
        circle, are dissolved into these parts, and matter is one of them. But
        all things which are not conceived with matter but without it, as the
        intelligible expression of form alone, are not corrupted either in an
        unqualified sense or in such a way as this. Hence these material parts
        are the principles and parts which come under these, but they are
        neither parts nor principles of the form. Therefore a statue made of
        clay is dissolved into clay, and a sphere into bronze, and Callias into
        flesh and bones; and again a circle is dissolved into its segments,
        because it is something conceived with matter. For the term circle is
        used equivocally both of that which is called such without qualification
        and of an individual circle, because there is no proper name for
        individual circles.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1460. Having shown what the quiddity (or essence) of a thing is, and to
        what things it belongs, and how it is related to the things to which it
        belongs, and that it is not necessary to posit separate quiddities in
        order to account for the generation of things, here the Philosopher’s
        aim is to expose the principles of which a thing’s quiddity is composed.
        This is divided into two parts. In the first (622:C 1460) he describes
        the principles of which a thing’s quiddity is composed; and in the
        second (640:C 1537) he explains how the thing which comes into being
        from these principles is one (“And now”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two. In the first he raises a difficulty.
        In the second (624:C 1467) he solves it (“Or perhaps”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two insofar as he raises two difficulties
        about the same point. The second (623:C 1464) is treated where he says,
        “Further, if parts.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (622), that every “definition is the
        intelligible expression of a thing,” i.e., a certain combination of
        words arranged by reason. For one word cannot constitute a definition,
        because a definition must convey a distinct knowledge of the real
        principles which come together to constitute a thing’s essence;
        otherwise a definition would not adequately expose a thing’s essence.
        And for this reason it is said in Book I of the <i>Physics</i> that a
        definition divides “the thing defined into its separate elements,” i.e.,
        it expresses distinctly each of the principles of the thing defined, and
        this can be done only by means of several words. Hence one word cannot
        be a definition, but it can give us information about something in the
        same way that a word which is better known can give us information about
        a word which is less well known. Now every intelligible expression has
        parts, because it is a composite utterance and not a simple word.
        Therefore it seems that, just as the intelligible expression of a thing
        is related to the thing, so also are the parts of the intelligible
        expression related to the parts of the thing. And for this reason the
        problem arises whether the intelligible expression of the parts must be
        given in that of the whole or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        1461. This difficulty is confirmed by the fact that in some intelligible
        expressions of wholes the intelligible expressions of the parts seem to
        be present, and in some not; for in the definition of a circle the
        definition “of the segments of a circle” is not present, i.e., the
        definition of the parts which are separated from the circle, as the
        semicircle and quarter circle; but in the definition of a syllable the
        definition “of its elements,” i.e., its letters, is present. For if a
        syllable is defined it is necessary to say that it is a sound composed
        of letters; and so we give in the definition of a syllable the letter
        and, consequently, its definition, because we can always substitute the
        definition for the word. Yet a circle is divided into segments as its
        parts, just as a syllable is divided “into its elements,” or letters.
      </p>
      <p>
        1462. Now his statement here that a part of the definition of a thing is
        related to a part of the thing as the definition is related to the
        thing, seems to involve a difficulty; for the definition is the same as
        the thing. Hence it seems to follow that the parts of the definition are
        the same as the parts of the thing; and this seems to be false. For the
        parts of the definition are predicated of the thing defined, as animal
        and rational are predicated of man, but no integral part is predicated
        of a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        1463. But it must be remarked that the parts of a definition signify the
        parts of a thing inasmuch as the parts of a definition are derived from
        the parts of a thing, yet not so that the parts of a definition are the
        parts of a thing. For neither animal nor rational are parts of man, but
        animal is taken from one part and rational from another; for an animal
        is a thing having a sentient nature, and a rational being is one having
        reason. Now sentient nature has the character of matter in relation to
        reason. And this is why genus is taken from matter and difference from
        form, and species from both matter and form together; for man is a thing
        having reason in a sentient nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        1464. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, if parts</span> (623).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second difficulty; and this has to do with the
        priority of parts. For all parts seem to be prior to a whole as simple
        things are prior to what is composite, because an acute angle is prior
        to a right angle, since a right angle is divided into two or more acute
        angles, and in the same way a finger is prior to a man. Hence it seems
        that an acute angle is naturally prior to a right angle, and a finger
        prior to a man.
      </p>
      <p>
        1465. But, on the other hand, the latter seem to be prior; namely, a
        right angle seems to be prior to an acute angle, and a man to a finger,
        and this seems to be so for two reasons. First, they are prior in
        meaning; for in this way those things which are given in the
        intelligible expression of other things are said to be prior to them,
        and not the other way around; “For in their intelligible expression an
        acute angle and a finger are explained from these,” i.e., they are
        defined in reference to these, namely, to man and to right angle, as we
        have stated. Hence it seems that a man and a right angle are prior to a
        finger and to an acute angle.
      </p>
      <p>
        1466. Second, some things are said to he prior because they can exist
        without others, for those things which can exist without others, and not
        the reverse, are said to be prior, as is stated in Book V (465:C 950);
        for example, the number one can exist without the number two. Now a man
        can exist without a finger, but not a finger without a man, because a
        finger which has been severed from the body is not a finger, as is
        stated below (626:C 1488). Hence it seems that a man is prior to a
        finger; and the same reasoning applies to a right angle and to an acute
        angle.
      </p>
      <p>1467. <span style="font-weight: bold">Or perhaps</span> (624).</p>
      <p>
        Then he solves the difficulties which were raised; and this is divided
        into two parts. In the first he gives the solution. In the second (625:C
        1482) he explains it (“The truth, then”). In the third (629:C 1501), he
        settles a problem that could arise from the foregoing solution (“Now the
        problem”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In support of what has been said in this chapter it should be noted that
        there are two opinions about the definitions of things and their
        essences. Some say that the whole essence of a species is the form; for
        example, the whole essence of man is his soul. And for this reason they
        say thaf in reality the form of the whole, which is signified by the
        word humanity, is the same as the form of the part, which is signified
        by the word soul, but that they differ only in definition; for the form
        of the part is so designated inasmuch as it perfects the matter and
        makes it to be actual, but the form of the whole is so designated
        inasmuch as the whole which is constituted by it is placed in its
        species. And for this reason they think that no material parts are given
        in the definition which designates the species, but only the formal
        principles of the species. This appears to be the opinion of Averroes
        and of certain of his followers.
      </p>
      <p>
        1468. But this seems to be opposed to the opinion of Aristotle; for he
        says above, in Book VI (535:C 1158), that natural things have sensible
        matter in their definition, and in this respect they differ from the
        objects of mathematics. Now it cannot be said that natural substances
        are defined by something that does not pertain to their being; for
        substances are not defined by addition but only accidents, as was stated
        above (587:C 1352). Hence it follows that sensible matter is a part of
        the essence of natural substances, and not only of individuals but also
        of species themselves; for it is not individuals that are defined but
        species.
      </p>
      <p>
        1469. And from this arises the other opinion, which Avicenna entertains.
        According to this opinion the form of the whole, which is the quiddity
        of the species, differs from the form of the part as a whole differs
        from a part; for the quiddity of a species is composed of matter and
        form, although not of this individual matter and this individual form;
        for it is an individual, such as Socrates or Callias, that is composed
        of these. This is the view which Aristotle introduces in this chapter in
        order to reject Plato’s opinion about the Ideas; for Plato said that the
        forms of natural things have being of themselves without sensible
        matter, as though sensible matter were in no way a part of their
        species. Therefore, having shown that sensible matter is a part of the
        species of natural things, he now shows that there cannot be species of
        natural things without sensible matter; for example, the species man
        cannot exist without flesh and bones; and the same is true in other
        cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        1470. Now this will constitute the third method by which the Ideas are
        rejected; for Aristotle rejected them, first, on the grounds that the
        essence of a thing does not exist apart from the thing to which it
        belongs; second, on the grounds that forms existing apart from matter
        are not causes of generation either in the manner of a generator or in
        that of an exemplar. And now in this third way he rejects Plato’s thesis
        on the grounds that the intelligible expression of a species includes
        common sensible matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1471. Hence in solving this difficulty (624) he says that the word part
        is used in several senses, as was explained in Book V (515:C 1093); for
        example, in one sense it means a quantitative part, i.e., one which
        measures a whole quantitatively, as half a cubit is part of a cubit, and
        the number two is part of the number six. But this type of part is at
        present omitted, because it is not his aim here to investigate the parts
        of quantity, but those of a definition, which signifies a thing’s
        substance. Hence it is necessary to investigate the parts of which a
        thing’s substance is composed.
      </p>
      <p>
        1472. Now the parts of substance are matter and form and the composite
        of these; and any one of these three—matter, form and the composite—is
        substance, as was stated above (569:C 1276). Therefore in one sense
        matter is part of a thing, and in another sense it is not, but this is
        true “of those things of which the intelligible expression or specifying
        principle consists,” i.e., the form; for we understand concavity as form
        and nose as matter, and snub as the composite. And according to this,
        flesh, which is the matter or a part of the matter, is not a part of
        concavity, which is the form or specifying principle; for flesh is the
        matter in which the form is produced. Yet flesh is some part of snub,
        provided that snub is understood to be a composite and not merely a
        form. Similarly, bronze is a part of the whole statue, which is composed
        of matter and form; but it is not a part of’ the statue insofar as
        statue is taken here in the sense of the specifying principle, or form.
      </p>
      <p>
        1473. And to insure an understanding of what the specifying principle is
        and what the matter is, it is necessary to point out that anything which
        belongs to a thing inasmuch as it has a specific form belongs to its
        specific form; for example, inasmuch as a thing has the form of a
        statue, it is proper for it to have a shape or some such quality. But
        what is related to a form as its matter must never be predicated
        essentially of a form. Yet it must be noted that no kind of matter, be
        it common or individual, is related essentially to a species insofar as
        species is taken in the sense of a form, but insofar as it is taken in
        the sense of a universal; for example, when we say that man is a
        species, common matter then pertains essentially to the species, but not
        individual matter, in which the nature of the form is included.
      </p>
      <p>
        1474. Hence it must be said that the definition of a circle is not
        included in “the definition of its segments,” i.e., the parts divided
        from a circle, whether they be semicircles or quarter circles. But the
        definition of a syllable includes that “of its elements,” or letters;
        and the reason is that “the elements,” or letters, are parts of a
        syllable with reference to its form, but not to its matter; for the form
        of a syllable consists in being composed of letters. The divisions of a
        circle, however, are not parts of a circle taken formally, but of this
        part of a circle, or of these circles, as the matter in which the form
        of a circle is produced.
      </p>
      <p>
        1475. This can be understood from the rule laid down above; for he had
        said that what belongs essentially to each thing having a form pertains
        to the form, and that what belongs to the matter is accidental to the
        specific form; but it belongs essentially to a syllable, which is
        composed of letters. Now the fact that a circle may be actually divided
        into semicircles is accidental to a circle, not as a circle, but as this
        circle, of which this line, which is a material part of it, is a
        division. Hence it is clear that a semicircle is part of a circle in
        reference to individual matter. Therefore this matter, i.e., this line,
        is more akin to the form than bronze is, which is sensible matter, when
        roundness, which is the form of a circle, is produced in bronze; because
        the form of a circle never exists apart from a line, but it does exist
        apart from bronze. And just as the parts of a circle, which are
        accidents in reference to individual matter, are not given in its
        definition, in a similar fashion not all letters are given in the
        definition of a syllable, i.e., those which are parts along with matter,
        for example, those inscribed in wax or produced in the air, since these
        are already parts of a syllable as sensible matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1476. For not all the parts into which a thing is corrupted, when it is
        dissolved must be parts of its substance; because even if a line when
        divided is dissolved into two parts, or a man into bones, sinews, and
        flesh, it does not therefore follow, if a line is thus composed of
        halves, or a man of flesh and bones, that these are parts of their
        substance; but these things are constituted of these parts as their
        matter. Hence these are parts of “the concrete whole,” or composite,
        “but not of the specifying principle,” i.e., the form, or “of that to
        which the intelligible expression belongs,” i.e., of the thing defined.
        Therefore no such parts are properly given in the intelligible
        expressions of these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1477. Still it must be noted that in the definitions of some things the
        intelligible expressions of such parts are included, i.e., in the
        definitions of composite things, of which they are the parts. But in the
        definitions of other things this is not necessary, i.e., in the
        definitions of forms, unless such forms are taken along with matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        For even though matter is not part of a form, it must be given in the
        definition of a form, since the mind cannot conceive of a form without
        conceiving matter; for example, organic body is included in the
        definition of soul. For just as accidents have complete being only
        insofar as they belong to a subject, in a similar fashion forms have
        complete being only insofar as they belong to their proper matters. And
        for this reason, just as accidents are defined by adding their subjects,
        so too a form is defined by adding its proper matter. Hence when matter
        is included in the definition of a form, there is definition by
        addition, but not when it is included in the definition of a composite.
      </p>
      <p>
        1478. Or his statement “unless taken together they constitute the
        intelligible expression of the thing” exemplifies his remark that “in
        other cases it need not include them.” For in such cases it is not
        necessary that the material parts should be included in the definition,
        i.e., in the case of those things which are not taken together with
        matter, or which do not signify something composed of matter and form.
        This is evident; for since matter is not included in the intelligible
        expression of some things but is included in that of others, there can
        be some things which “are composed of these as the principles into which
        they are dissolved,” i.e., the parts into which things are dissolved by
        corruption. And these are the things whose definitions include matter.
        But there are some things which are not composed of the foregoing
        material parts as principles, as those in whose definitions matter is
        not included.
      </p>
      <p>
        1479. And since matter is included in the definitions of those things
        which are taken together with matter but not in those of others, “hence
        all things which are matter and form taken together.” i.e., all things
        which signify something composed of matter and form, such as snub or
        brazen circle, such things are corrupted into material parts, and one of
        these is matter. But those things which are not conceived by the mind
        with matter but lack matter altogether, as those which belong to the
        notion of the species or form alone, these are not corrupted “in such a
        way as this,” i.e., by being dissolved into certain material parts. For
        some forms are corrupted in no way, as the intellectual substances,
        which exist of themselves, whereas others which do not exist of
        themselves are corrupted accidentally when their subject is corrupted.

        1480. Hence it is evident that material parts of this kind are the
        principles and parts of those things “which come under these,” i.e.,
        which depend on these, as a whole depends on its component parts; yet
        they are neither parts nor principles of the form. And for this reason
        when a composite, such as a statue made of clay, is corrupted, “it is
        dissolved into its matter,” i.e., into clay, as a brazen sphere is
        dissolved into bronze, and as Callias, who is a particular man, is
        dissolved into flesh and bones. Similarly a particular circle depending
        on these divided lines is corrupted into its segments; for just as
        Callias is a man conceived with individual matter, so too a circle whose
        parts are these particular segments is a particular circle conceived
        with individual matter. Yet there is this difference, that singular men
        have a proper name, and therefore the name of the species is not applied
        equivocally to the individual, but the term circle is applied
        equivocally to the circle “which is called such in an unqualified
        sense,” i.e., in a universal sense, and to singular particular circles.
        And the reason is that names are not given to several particular circles
        but they are given to particular men.
      </p>
      <p>
        1481. Moreover it must be noted that the name of the species is not
        predicated of the individual in the sense that it refers the common
        nature of the species to it, but it is predicated of it equivocally, if
        it is predicated in such a way that it signifies this individual as
        such; for if I say “Socrates is a man,” the word man is not used
        equivocally. But if this word man is imposed as a proper name on some
        individual man, it will signify both the species and this individual
        equivocally. It is similar in the case of the word circle, which
        signifies the species and this particular circle equivocally.<br /></p

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 10: 1035b 3-1036a 25
      </p>
      <p>
        625. The truth, then, has now been stated; but let us state it even more
        clearly by repeating the same discussion. For all things which are parts
        of a thing’s inintelligible expression and that into which its
        intelligible expression is divided, are prior to it, either all or some
        of them. But the intelligible expression of a right angle is not divided
        into that of an acute angle, but the intelligible expression of an acute
        angle is divided into that of a right angle; and one who defines an
        acute angle uses a right angle, for an acute angle is less than a right
        angle. And the same thing is true of a circle and a semicircle; for a
        semicircle is defined by means of a circle, and a finger is defined by
        means of the whole man, because a finger is such and such a part of man.
        Hence all parts which have the nature of matter and are that into which
        the whole is divided as matter are subsequent [to the whole]. But all
        things which are parts of the intelligible expression and of the
        substance according to its intelligible expression are prior, either all
        or some of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        626. And since the soul of animals (for this is the substance of living
        things) is their form according to the intelligible expression, and is
        the substance, species, or essence of such a body (for if a part of each
        animal is properly defined, it will not be defined without its function,
        and this will not be possible without sensation), therefore parts of
        this kind, either all or some of them, are prior to the concrete whole,
        the animal; and this is likewise true of every individual thing. But the
        body and parts of this kind are subsequent to this substance; and it is
        not substance but the concrete whole which is divided into these as its
        matter. Therefore in a sense these are prior to the concrete whole and
        in a sense they are not; for they cannot exist apart, because a finger
        is not a part of an animal when it is disposed in just any way at all;
        for a dead finger is called a finger equivocally. But some parts are
        simultaneous with the whole, and these are the principal parts in which
        the intelligible expression and substance are present, for example, the
        heart or the brain, because it makes no difference which of them is
        such. But man and horse and those terms which are applied in this way to
        singular things, but are taken universally, are not substance, but a
        certain concrete whole composed of this matter and this intelligible
        expression taken universally. Socrates, however, is already a singular
        thing by reason of ultimate matter; and it is similar in other cases.
        Hence a part is a part of the species (which means the essence of a
        thing) and of the concrete whole which is composed of species and matter
        itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        627. But only the parts of the species ire parts of the intelligible
        expression, and the intelligible expression is of the universal; for the
        being of a circle is the same as a circle, and the being of a soul the
        same as a soul. But in the case of a concrete whole, for example,
        <i>this</i> circle, or any singular thing, either sensible or
        intelligible (by <i>sensible</i> circles I mean those made of bronze and
        wood, and by <i>intelligible</i>, such as are the objects of
        mathematics), of these there is no definition; but they are known by
        intellect or by sense, i.e., when they are actually seen. And when they
        are removed from a state of actuality, it is not clear whether they
        exist or not; but they are always known and expressed by a universal
        formula. Now matter is unknowable in itself. And in one respect matter
        is sensible, and in another it is intelligible; sensible matter being
        such as brass and wood and anything mobile, and intelligible matter
        being what is present in sensible things but not as sensible, such as
        the objects of mathematics. How this applies to whole and part and to
        the prior and subsequent has therefore been stated.
      </p>
      <p>
        628. But when anyone asks whether a right angle and a circle and an
        animal are prior to the parts into which they are divided and of which
        they are composed, the answer must be that these are not parts without
        qualification. For if the soul is the same as an animal or a living
        thing, or the soul of each individual is the same as each individual,
        and if a circle is the same as the being of a circle, and a right angle
        is the same as the being of a right angle, the thing must be said to be
        subsequent to that by which it is, for example, to those parts which are
        included in its intelligible expression and to those in the universal
        right angle. For both the right angle which is found in matter, which is
        a bronze right angle, and that found in these particular lines, are
        subsequent to their parts; but the right angle which is immaterial is
        subsequent to the parts found in the intelligible expression, but is
        prior to those found in a particular thing. But to this question an
        unqualified answer must not be given. However, if the soul is something
        different and is not the same as an animal, even if this is so, in one
        sense it must be said that the parts are prior, and in another sense it
        must not, as has been stated.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1482. Since the foregoing solution was not always clear, for he had not
        yet shown how parts are prior, and subsequent or even distinguished the
        universal composite from the particular or the species from the form, he
        therefore now explains the foregoing solution. This is divided into two
        parts. In the first (625:C 1482) he explains the foregoing solution. In
        the second (628:C 1498) he tells us how the solution should be applied
        to this question (“But when anyone”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two sections. First, he answers the
        question about the priority of parts; and second (627:C 1492), the
        question whether the parts of the thing defined enter into its
        definition (“But only”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is again divided into two sections. First, he shows how
        parts are prior to wholes. Second (626:C 1484), he clarifies this by an
        example (“And since the soul”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (625), that while the explanation given above
        in the solution advanced is true in itself, it is still necessary to go
        over it again so that it may become more evident in reference to the
        present discussion. For all parts of a thing’s intelligible expression,
        i.e., those into which the intelligible expression is divided, must be
        prior to the thing defined, either all or some of them. This is said
        because sometimes the parts of the form are not necessarily parts of the
        species, but relate to the perfection of a thing; for example, sight and
        hearing, which are parts of the sentient soul, are not integral or
        necessary parts of an animal, inasmuch as there can exist an animal
        which does not have these senses. They nevertheless belong to the
        perfection of animal, because perfect animals do have these senses. Thus
        it is universally true that those parts which are given in the
        definition of anything are universally prior to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        1483. But even though an acute angle is part of a right angle, it is
        still not given in its definition; but the opposite is true, for the
        intelligible expression of a right angle is not dissolved into the
        definition of an acute angle, but the reverse. For he who defines an
        acute angle uses right angle in its definition, because an acute angle
        is less than a right angle. The same is true of a circle and a
        semicircle, which is defined by means of a circle, because it is a half
        of a circle. And the same thing holds true of a finger and a man, who is
        given in the definition of a finger; for a finger is defined as such and
        such a part of man. For it was stated above that the parts of the form
        are parts of the intelligible expression but not those of the matter.
        Therefore, if only the parts of the intelligible expression are prior
        and not those of the matter, it follows that all things which are
        material parts of the thing defined, into which it is dissolved in the
        same way that a composite is dissolved into its material principles, are
        subsequent. “But all things which are parts of the intelligible
        expression and of the substance according to its intelligible
        expression,” i.e., the parts of the form according to which the
        intelligible expression of the thing is understood, are prior to the
        whole, either all or some of them, according to the argument given
        above.
      </p>
      <p>1484. <span style="font-weight: bold">And since</span> (626).</p>
      <p>
        Here he explains what he has said, by using an example. He says that
        since the soul of living things is their substance according to its
        intelligible expression, i.e., the form from which they derive their
        intelligible expression, then the soul of an animal “is the substance,”
        i.e., the form or specifying principle or essence “of such a body,”
        namely, of an organic body; for an organic body can be defined only by
        means of a soul. And from this point of view a soul is said to be the
        essence of such a body.
      </p>
      <p>
        1485. The truth of this is shown by the fact that, if anyone properly
        defines a part of any animal at all, he can define it properly only by
        means of its proper operation, as, for example, if someone were to say
        that an eye is that part of an animal by which it sees. But the
        operation itself of the parts does not exist without sensation or motion
        or the other operations of the soul’s parts; and thus one who defines
        some part of the body must use the soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        1486. And since this is so, its parts, i.e., those of the soul, must be
        prior (either all of them, as happens in the case of perfect animals, or
        some of them, as happens in the case of imperfect animals) “to the
        concrete whole,” i.e., to the composite of body and soul. The same thing
        is true of every other individual thing, because the formal parts must
        always be prior to any composite.
      </p>
      <p>
        1487. But the body and its parts are subsequent “to this substance,”
        i.e., to the form, which is the soul, since the soul must be given in
        the definition of the body, as has already been stated (C 1485); and
        what is divided into the parts of the body as its matter is not “the
        substance itself,” but “the concrete whole,” i.e., the composite. It is
        clear, then, that in a sense the parts of the body are prior to “the
        concrete whole,” i.e., to the composite, and in a sense they are not.
      </p>
      <p>
        1488. In fact they are prior in the way in which the simple is prior to
        the complex, inasmuch as the composite animal is constituted of them.
        However, they are not prior in the sense in which prior means something
        that can exist without something else; for the parts of the body cannot
        exist apart from the animal. Thus a finger is not a finger under all
        conditions, because one that is severed or dead is called such only
        equivocally, for example, the finger of a statue or that in a painting.
        But from this point of view parts of this kind are subsequent to the
        composite animal, because an animal can exist without a finger.
      </p>
      <p>
        1489. But there are certain parts which, even though they are not prior
        to the whole animal with this sort of priority, are nevertheless
        simultaneous with the whole, from this point of view; because, just as
        the parts themselves cannot exist without the entire body, neither can
        the entire animal exist without them. And parts of this kind are the
        principal parts of the body in which “the form,” i.e., the soul, first
        exists, namely, the heart or the brain. Nor does it make any difference
        to his thesis what things may be such.
      </p>
      <p>
        1490. Yet it must be borne in mind that this composite, animal or man,
        can be taken in two ways: either as a universal or as a singular. An
        example of a universal composite would be animal and man, and of a
        singular composite, Socrates and Callias. Hence he says that man and
        horse and those predicates which are used in this way in reference to
        singular things but are taken universally, as man and horse, “are not
        substance,” i.e., they are not just form alone, but are concrete wholes
        composed of a determinate matter and a determinate form (i.e., insofar
        as these are taken not individually but universally). For
        <i>man</i> means something composed of body and soul, but not of this
        body and this soul, whereas <i>a singular man</i> means something
        composed of “ultimate matter,” i.e., individual matter: for Socrates is
        something composed of this body and this soul, and the same is true of
        other singular things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1491. Hence it is clear that matter is a part of the species. But by
        <i>species</i> here we mean not just the form but the essence of the
        thing. And it is also clear that matter is a part of this whole which
        “is composed of species and matter,” i.e., the singular, which signifies
        the nature of the species in this determinate matter. For matter is part
        of a composite, and a composite is both universal and singular.
      </p>
      <p>
        1492. <span style="font-weight: bold">But only the parts</span> (627).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he explains what parts should be given in a definition. For since
        it was shown (622:C 1463) which parts are parts of the species as well
        as which are parts of the individual (because matter taken commonly is
        part of the species, whereas this definite matter is part of the
        individual), it is evident that only those parts which are parts of the
        species are parts of the intelligible expression, and not those which
        are parts of the individual; for flesh and bones, and not this flesh and
        these bones, are given in the definition of man; and the reason is that
        the definitive expression is applied only universally.
      </p>
      <p>
        1493. For since the essence of a thing is the same as the thing of which
        it is the essence, as was shown above (591:C 1362), there will be a
        definition which is the intelligible expression or essence only of that
        which is the same as its own essence. Now things of this kind are
        universal and not singular; for a circle and the being of a circle are
        the same, and it is similar in the case of a soul and the being of a
        soul. But there is no definition of those things which are composed of a
        form and individual matter, as of this circle or of any other singular
        thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        1494. Nor does it make any difference whether the singulars are sensible
        or intelligible; sensible singulars being such things as brazen and
        wooden circles, and intelligible singulars being such as mathematical
        circles. Now that some singulars are considered among the objects of
        mathematics is clear from the fact that in this order many things of the
        same species are observed~ as many equal lines and many similar figures.
        And such singulars are said to be intelligible insofar as they are
        grasped without the senses by means of imagination alone, which is
        sometimes referred to as an intellect, according to the statement in
        Book III of <i>The Soul</i>: “The passive intellect is corruptible.”
      </p>
      <p>
        1495. Therefore there is no definition of singular circles, because
        those things of which there is definition are known by their own
        definition. But singulars are known only as long as they come under the
        senses or imagination, which is called an intellect here because it
        considers things without the senses just as the intellect does. But
        “when” singular circles of this kind “are removed from a state of
        actuality,” i.e., when they are no longer considered by the senses (in
        reference to sensible circles) and by imagination (in reference to
        mathematical circles), it is not evident whether they exist as
        singulars; yet they are always referred to and known by their universal
        formula. For even when they are not actually being perceived, these
        sensible circles are known inasmuch as they are circles, but not
        inasmuch as they are these circles.
      </p>
      <p>
        1496. The reason for this is that matter, which is the principle of
        individuation, is unknowable in itself and is known only by means of the
        form, from which the universal formula is derived. Therefore when
        singular things are absent, they are known only by their universals. Now
        matter is the principle of individuation not only in singular things but
        also in the objects of mathematics; for there are two kinds of matter,
        one sensible and the other intelligible. And by sensible matter is meant
        such things as bronze and wood, or any changeable matter, such as fire
        and water and all things of this sort; and singular sensible things are
        individuated by such matter. But by intelligible matter is meant what
        exists in things which are sensible but are not viewed as sensible, as
        the objects of mathematics. For just as the form of man exists in such
        and such Matter, which is an organic body, in a similar way the form of
        a circle or of a triangle exists in this matter, which is a continuum,
        whether surface or solid.
      </p>
      <p>
        1497. He therefore concludes that he has explained the relationship of
        whole and part, and the sense in which there is priority and
        posteriority, i.e., how a part is a part of the whole, and how it is
        prior and how subsequent. For the parts of individual matter are parts
        of the singular composite but not of the species or form, whereas the
        parts of universal matter are parts of the species but not of the form.
        And since universals and not singulars are defined, the parts of
        individual matter are therefore not given in a thing’s definition, but
        only the parts of common matter together with the form or parts of the
        form.
      </p>
      <p>1498. <span style="font-weight: bold">But when anyone</span> (628).</p>
      <p>
        He now adapts the proposed solution to the question previously noted. He
        says that when someone asks whether a right angle and a circle and an
        animal are prior to their parts, or the reverse: whether the parts into
        which these things are divided and of which they are composed are prior,
        we must meet this question by using the foregoing solution. Now in reply
        to this an un qualified answer cannot be given; for there are two
        opinions on this point. Some say that the whole species is the same as
        the form so that man is the same as his soul, and others say that they
        are not, but that man is a composite of body and soul. And it is
        necessary to answer each opinion in a different way.
      </p>
      <p>
        1499. For if a soul is the same as an animal or a living thing, or in a
        similar way, if each thing is the same as its form (for example, a
        circle is the same as the form of a circle, and a right angle the same
        as the form of a right angle), we must answer by establishing which is
        subsequent and in what way it is subsequent; because from this point of
        view the parts of the matter are subsequent to those in the intelligible
        expression, and to those “in some right angle,” i.e., in the universal
        right angle, but they are prior to those in a particular right angle.
        For this right angle which is bronze has sensible matter, and this right
        angle which is contained in singular lines has intelligible matter; but
        that right angle which is “immaterial,” i.e., common, will be subsequent
        to the parts of the form present in the intelligible expression, and it
        will be prior to the parts of the matter which are the parts of singular
        things. And according to this opinion it will not be possible to
        distinguish between common matter and individual matter. Yet an
        unqualified answer must not be given to this question, because it will
        be necessary to distinguish between the parts of the matter and those of
        the form.

        1500. If, however, the other opinion is true, namely, that the soul is
        different from the animal, it will be necessary both to say and not to
        say that the parts are prior to the whole, as was previously
        established; because with regard to this opinion he instructed us above
        to distinguish not only between matter and form, but also between common
        matter, which is part of the species, and individual matter, which is
        part of the individual.<br /></p

        629. Now the problem rightly arises as to what parts are parts of the
        species, and which are not parts of the species but of the concrete
        whole. For if this is not clear it is impossible to define anything,
        because definition refers to the universal and the species. Hence, if it
        is not evident as to what parts are mate rial and what are not, the
        intelligible expression of the thing will not be clearly known.
      </p>
      <p>
        630. Therefore in the case of all those things which seem to be produced
        in specifically different matters, as a circle in bronze and in stone
        and in wood, it seems to be evident that none of these, either bronze or
        stone or wood, belong to the substance of a circle, because it can be
        separated from them. And with regard to those things which do not seem
        to be separable, nothing prevents them from being similar to these, as,
        for instance, if all sensible circles were of bronze; for none the less
        the bronze would be no part of the species. But it is difficult to
        separate it in the mind; for example, the species of man always appears
        in flesh and bones and such parts. Hence the question arises whether
        these are parts of the species and intelligible expression of man, or
        are not but have the character of matter. But since such species do not
        occur in other matters, we cannot separate them.
      </p>
      <p>
        631. Now since this seems to be possible, but it is not clear when, some
        thinkers are puzzled even in the case of a circle and a triangle, as if
        it were not right to define these by lines and by what is continuous,
        but that all these should be predicated in a way similar to the flesh
        and bones of a man and the bronze and stone of a circle. And they refer
        all things to numbers and say that the intelligible expression of a line
        is that of the number two. And of those who speak of Ideas, some claim
        that the number two is the line itself, and others claim that it is the
        Form of a line; for some say that a Form and the thing of which it is
        the Form are the same, for example, the number two and the Form of
        twoness; but this is not so in the case of a line.
      </p>
      <p>
        632. It follows, then, that there is one Form of many things whose Form
        appears to be different; and this is a conclusion that also faced the
        Pythagoreans (68).
      </p>
      <p>
        633. And it is possible [according to this view] to make one Form proper
        to all things, and to maintain that nothing else is a Form at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        634. However, in this way all things will be one. Therefore that the
        questions about definitions constitute a problem, and why, has been
        stated.
      </p>
      <p>
        635. Hence to reduce all things in this way and to do away with matter
        is superfluous; for perhaps some things are a this in this, or are
        things having these two principles. And the analogy of the animal, which
        the younger Socrates was accustomed to state, is not a good one; for it
        leads us away from the truth and makes us suppose that it is possible
        for man to exist without parts, as a circle exists without bronze. But
        this case is not similar; for an animal is something sensible and cannot
        be defined without motion, and therefore it cannot be defined without
        its parts being disposed in some way. For it is not a hand in any
        condition which is part of a man, but when it is capable of performing
        the function of a hand. Hence it is a part when it is animated, but it
        is not a part when it is not animated.
      </p>
      <p>
        636. And with regard to the objects of mathematics the question arises
        why the intelligible structures of the parts are not parts of the
        intelligible structure of the whole (for example, why semicircles are
        not parts of the intelligible structure of a circle), for they are not
        sensible. But perhaps this makes no difference; for there will be matter
        of certain things and of those which are not sensible. And this will be
        true of everything which is not an essence or species considered in
        itself, but a particular thing. Therefore the semicircle will not be
        part of the circle which is universal, but semicircles will be parts of
        singular circles, as was said before (627); for some matter is sensible
        and some intelligible.
      </p>
      <p>
        637. And it is also evident that the soul is a primary substance, and
        that the body is matter, and that man or animal is the composite of both
        taken universally. And Socrates and Coriscus are composed of soul and
        body taken individually, i.e., if the term soul is taken in two senses;
        for some take soul as soul and others as the whole. But if soul and body
        without qualification mean this individual soul and this individual
        body, each term is used both as a universal and as a singular.
      </p>
      <p>
        638. But whether there are besides the matter of such substances other
        substances as well, and whether it is necessary to look for some
        different substance in these, such as numbers or something of this kind,
        must be examined later (Books XIII & XIV); for it is for the sake of
        these too that we are trying to define sensible substances, since in a
        sense the study of sensible substances constitutes the work of the
        philosophy of nature, or second philosophy. For the philosopher of
        nature must have scientific knowledge not only of matter but of the part
        which is intelligible, and the latter is the more important. And with
        regard to definitions the philosopher must know how the parts in the
        intelligible expression are disposed, and why the definition is one
        intelligible expression; for it is evident that a thing is one. But how
        a thing having parts is one must be examined later (733).
      </p>
      <p>
        639. We have stated, then, what the essence of a thing is and how it is
        predicated essentially of all things (582), as well as why the
        intelligible expression of the essence of some things contains the parts
        of the thing defined, and why that of others does not. And we have also
        stated that those parts which have the nature of matter are not found in
        the intelligible expression of substance; for they are not parts of that
        substance, but of the whole. And in one sense there is an intelligible
        expression of this and in another sense there is not; for there is no
        intelligible expression that involves matter, because this is
        indeterminate. But there is an intelligible expression of the whole with
        reference to primary substance; for example, in the case of man there is
        an intelligible expression of the soul; for the substance of a thing is
        the specifying principle intrinsic to it, and the whole substance is
        composed of this along with matter. Concavity, for example, is such a
        principle, for from this and from nose snubnose and snubnesss are
        derived. For nose is also contained twice in these expressions; but in
        the whole substance or in snubnose or in Callias matter is also present.
        And we have also stated that in some cases the essence of the thing is
        the same as the thing itself, as in the case of primary substances; for
        curvature and the essence of curvature are the same, if curvature is
        primary. And by primary I mean what does not refer to something as
        existing in something else as its subject or matter. But all things
        which have the nature of matter or are conceived with matter, are not
        the same-not even if they are one accidentally, as Socrates and
        musician, for they are accidentally the same (590).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1501. In this part he solves a problem which could arise from the answer
        to the foregoing question; for in answering that question he had
        distinguished the parts of the species from those of the individual
        thing, which is composed of species and matter. Hence he now inquires as
        to what parts are parts of the species and what are not.
      </p>
      <p>
        This part is therefore divided into three sections. In the first (629:C
        1501) he solves the problem. In the second (638:C 1525) he shows what
        remains to be discussed (“But whether”). In the third (639:C 1529) he
        summarizes the points discussed (“We have stated”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (629), that since it has been stated that the
        parts of the species are given in definitions, but not the parts of the
        thing composed of matter and species, there is a real problem as to what
        parts are parts of the species, and what are not parts of the species
        “but of the concrete whole,” i.e., the individual thing, in which the
        nature of the species is taken along with individuating matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1502. For if this is not evident, we will be unable to define anything
        correctly, because definition never pertains to the singular but only to
        the universal, as was stated above (627:C 149397). And among universals
        the species is properly included, and this is constituted of genus and
        difference, of which every definition is composed; for a genus is
        defined only if there is also a species. Hence it is clear that unless
        we know what part has the nature of matter, and what part does not but
        pertains to the species itself, it will not be evident as to what
        definition should be assigned to a thing, since it is assigned only to
        the species. And in the definition of the species it is necessary to
        give the parts of the species and not those which are subsequent to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        1503.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore in the case</span> (630).
      </p>
      <p>
        He solves the proposed problem; and in regard to this he does three
        things. First (630:C 1503), he gives the solution according to the
        opinion of the Platonists. Second (632:C 1512), he rejects it (“It
        follows”). Third (635:C 196), he solves it by giving his own opinion
        (“Hence to reduce”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he solves the proposed
        difficulty in reference to sensible things; and second (631:C 1507), in
        reference to the objects of mathematics (“Now since this seems”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first (630), then, that In the case of some things it is
        evident that matter is not part of the species, for example, all those
        which appear to be produced in specifically different matters, as a
        circle is found to be produced in bronze, in stone and in wood. Hence it
        is evident that neither bronze nor stone nor wood is part of the
        substance of circle, as though it were a part of the form, circle. And
        this is evident by reason of the fact that circle may be separated from
        each of these matters, and nothing can be separated from something which
        is a part of its form.
      </p>
      <p>
        1504. But there are some things whose species do not occur as produced
        in specifically different matters, but always in the same matters; for
        example, the species of man insofar as it is apparent to the sense of
        sight is found only in flesh and bones. However, nothing prevents those
        things which do not seem to be separate from their proper matter from
        also being related in the same way to their own matters as those things
        which can exist in different matters and be separated from each of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        1505. For if we were to maintain that some circles would not be apparent
        to the senses unless they were composed of bronze, none the less bronze
        would not be in this way a part of the form of circle. And even though
        circle would not then be actually separate from bronze, it would still
        be separable in thought, since the species of circle can be understood
        without bronze, since bronze is not part of the form of circle, although
        it is difficult to mentally separate and isolate from each other those
        things which are not actually separate; for this belongs only to those
        things which can be raised above the sensible order by the intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
        1506. And similarly, if the species of man always appears in flesh and
        bones and such parts, it is necessary to ask whether these are parts of
        man’s species “and of the intelligible expression,” or definition, of
        man; or whether they are not the species’ parts, but only the matter of
        the species, as bronze is the matter of a circle. But because such a
        species does not arise in other material parts than these, therefore we
        cannot by means of our intellect easily separate man from flesh and
        bones; for the reasoning seems to be the same in this case as in that of
        a circle, if all circles were of bronze.
      </p>
      <p>1507. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now since this</span> (631).</p>
      <p>
        Then he continues his discussion by examining the opinion just touched
        on insofar as it relates to the objects of mathematics, He says that in
        some cases it seems possible for matter not to be a part of the species,
        although the species occurs only in matter, but it is not evident when
        and in what instances this is possible or not possible. Therefore some
        thinkers are puzzled about this, not only in reference to natural things
        but also in reference to the objects of mathematics, such as circles and
        triangles.
      </p>
      <p>
        1508. For it seems to them that, just as sensible matter is not a part
        of the species of natural beings, in a similar fashion intelligible
        matter is not a part of the species of mathematical entities. Now the
        intelligible matter of mathematical figures is continuous quantity, such
        as lines and surfaces. Hence it was thought that a line is not part of
        the species of a circle or triangle (as if it were not right that a
        triangle and a circle should be defined by lines and by continuous
        quantity, since they are not parts of the species), but that all those
        things are related to a circle and a triangle in the same way that flesh
        and bones are related to man, and bronze and stones to circles.
      </p>
      <p>
        1509. But when the continuous quantity, line, is removed from triangles
        and circles, the only thing that remains is the unit and number, because
        a triangle is a figure having three lines, and a circle is a figure
        having one. Therefore, not holding that lines are parts of the species,
        they refer all species to numbers, saying that numbers are the species
        of all mathematical entities; for they say that the intelligible
        structure of the number two is that of a straight line, because a
        straight line is terminated by two points.
      </p>
      <p>
        1510. But among the Platonists, who posit Ideas, there is a difference
        of opinion on this matter; for some of them, i.e,, those who did not
        make the objects of mathematics an intermediate class between the Forms
        and sensible things but claimed that the Forms are numbers, said that
        the line is the number two, because they did not hold that there is an
        intermediate line differing from the Form of a line.
      </p>
      <p>
        1511. But others said that the number two is not a line but the Form of
        a line; for according to them the line is a mathematical intermediate
        between the Forms and sensible things; and they said that the number two
        is the Form itself of the number two. And according to them there are
        some things in which the Form and the thing of which it is the Form do
        not differ, for example, numbers. Hence they said that the number two
        and the Form of twoness are the same. But this is not the case with a
        line, in their opinion, because a line already expresses something
        participating in a Form, since there are found to be many lines in one
        species; and this would not be so if the line itself were a separate
        Form.
      </p>
      <p>
        1512. <span style="font-weight: bold">It follows, then</span> (632).
      </p>
      <p>
        He now rejects the solution given above; and he gives three arguments,
        of which the first is this: if numbers alone are separate Forms, all
        things which participate in one number will participate in one Form. But
        there are many specifically different things which participate in one
        number; for one and the same number is present in a triangle because of
        its three lines, and in a syllogism because of its three terms, and in a
        solid because of its three dimensions. Hence it follows that there is
        one Form of many things which are specifically different. This was the
        conclusion which faced not only the Platonists but also the
        Pythagoreans, who also claimed that the nature of everything consists in
        numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        1513. <span style="font-weight: bold">And it is possible</span> (633).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second argument, which is as follows: if flesh and
        bones are not parts of the Form of man, and lines not parts of the Form
        of triangle, then for a like reason no matter is part of a Form. But in
        the case of numbers, according to the Platonists, the number two is
        attributed to matter and unity to Form. Therefore only unity constitutes
        Form. But the number two, and therefore all other numbers, inasmuch as
        they imply matter, will not be Forms. Hence there will only be one Form
        of all things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1514. <span style="font-weight: bold">However, in this way</span> (634).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument, which is as follows: those things are
        one whose Form is one. Hence if there is only one Form of all things, it
        follows that all things are one formally, and not just those which seem
        to be different [but in reality are not]. Yet it can be said that this
        third argument does not differ from the second one, but that it is an
        absurdity which follows as a conclusion of the second argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        1515. Therefore having given the arguments on which the foregoing
        solution is based, and having given two arguments against this solution,
        he concludes that the questions about definitions constitute a problem,
        and that the reason for this has been stated. Thus it is evident that he
        wishes to use everything which has been set down to expose the
        difficulty connected with the foregoing problem.
      </p>
      <p>1516. <span style="font-weight: bold">Hence to reduce</span> (635).</p>
      <p>
        He now gives the real solution of the foregoing problem based on his own
        doctrine. He does this first with regard to natural things; and second
        (636-.C 1520), with regard to the objects of mathematics (“And with
        regard”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (635), that since the absurdities mentioned
        above plague those removing from the species of a thing all material
        parts, whether they are sensible or not, it is evident from what has
        been said that it is futile to reduce all species of things to numbers
        or to the unit and to do away completely with sensible and intelligible
        matter as the Platonists did.
      </p>
      <p>
        1517. For some forms of things are not forms without matter, but are “a
        this in this,” i.e., a form in matter, in such a way that what results
        from the form existing in matter is the species. Or if they are not like
        a form in matter, they are like things which have a form in matter; for
        properly speaking natural things have form in matter, and the objects of
        mathematics also resemble these in a way inasmuch as the figure of a
        circle or a triangle is related to lines as the form of man is related
        to flesh and bones. Therefore just as man’s species is not a form
        without flesh and bones, neither is the form of a triangle or of a
        circle a form without lines. Hence the analogy of animal, which the
        younger Socrates was accustomed to use, is not a good one.
      </p>
      <p>
        1518. Now it seems that Plato himself is called the younger Socrates,
        because in all his works he introduces Socrates as the speaker, since
        Socrates was his master. And Plato’s opinion about the materiality of
        natural species he calls an analogy, because it is similar to fables,
        which are devised for the purpose of conveying some opinion by means of
        a metaphor; and this is why he said above in Book III (254:C 471; 257:C
        474), that this opinion resembles the opinion of those who assume that
        there are gods and that their forms are like human ones. Hence the view
        expressed above is not a good one, because it leads us away from the
        truth insofar as it makes us think that it is possible for man to exist
        without flesh mid bones, just as it is possible for a circle to exist
        without bronze, which clearly does not belong to the species of a
        circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        199. But this case is not similar; for a man is not related to flesh and
        bones in the same way that a circle is related to bronze, because a
        circle is not something sensible in its own intelligible expression; for
        it can be understood without sensible matter. Hence, bronze, which is
        sensible matter, is not part of the species of a circle. But an animal
        seems to be a sensible thing since it cannot be defined without motion;
        for an animal is distinguished from something that is not an animal by
        means of sensation and motion, as is clear in Book I of <i>The Soul</i>.
        Therefore an animal cannot be defined without including bodily parts,
        which are disposed in a proper way for motion; for the hand is not a
        part of man when it exists in every state, but when it is disposed in
        such a way that it can perform the proper work of a hand; and this it
        cannot do without the soul, which is the principle of motion. Hence it
        is necessary that the hand be a part of man insofar as it is animated,
        but it is not a part of man insofar as it is not animated, like the hand
        of a corpse or that in a painting. Therefore such parts as are required
        for the carrying out of the proper operation of the species must be
        parts of the species; both those which pertain to the form and those
        which pertain to matter.

      <p>
        1520. <span style="font-weight: bold">And with regard to</span> (636).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next he answers the question with regard to the objects of mathematics;
        for though the solution has been given above with regard to natural
        things, it seems that the difficulty still remains with regard to the
        objects of mathematics; for he had said above that since an animal is
        sensible it cannot be defined without sensible parts, as a circle can be
        defined without bronze, which is sensible matter. Therefore “with regard
        to the objects of mathematics the question arises why the intelligible
        expressions of the parts,” i.e., the definitions of the parts, “are not
        parts of the intelligible expression of the whole,” e.g., why
        semicircles, or half-circles, are not given in the definition of a
        circle-, for it cannot be said that these, namely, semicircles, are
        sensible things, as bronze is sensible matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1521. But he answers that it makes no difference to his thesis whether
        the material parts are sensible or not, because there is intelligible
        matter even in things which are not sensible. And such matter—the kind
        which is not a part of the species—belongs to everything whose essence
        or species is not the same as itself “but is a particular thing,” i.e.,
        a determinate particular, as if to say that in everything which is not
        its own species but is a definite individual determined in species there
        must be certain material parts which are not parts of the species. For
        since Socrates is not identical with his own humanity but has humanity,
        for this reason he has in himself certain material parts which are not
        parts of his species but of this individual matter, which is the
        principle of individuation, for example, this flesh and these bones.
      </p>
      <p>
        1522. And, similarly, in this particular circle there are these
        particular lines which are not parts of the species. Hence it is clear
        that parts of this kind are not parts of the universal circle but of
        singular circles, as was stated above (627:C 1492). And for this reason
        semicircles are not included in the definition of the universal circle,
        because they are parts of singular circles and not of the universal
        circle. This is true both of sensible and intelligible matter; for
        matter is found in both modes, as is evident from what has been said.
        But if there were some individual which was the same as its own species,
        for example, if Socrates were his own humanity, there would be no parts
        in Socrates which would not be parts of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>1523. <span style="font-weight: bold">And it is also</span> (637).</p>
      <p>
        He now sums up the solution given above by using animal as an example.
        He says that it is evident that the soul “is a primary substance,” i.e.,
        the form of animal, and that the body is matter, and that “man is the
        composite of both,” i.e., insofar as they are taken universally; but
        that Socrates or Coriscus is the composite of both taken particularly,
        because “soul is taken in two senses,” i.e., universally and
        particularly, as soul and as this soul. Hence what is signified as a
        whole must be taken both universally and singularly, in the way in which
        soul is taken in two senses, because this is in keeping with both views
        which men take of the soul. For, as was said above (624:C 1467), some
        claim that a man or an animal is its soul, whereas others say that a man
        or an animal is not its soul “but the whole,” i.e., the composite of
        soul and body.
      </p>
      <p>
        1524. It is evident, then, according to the opinion which affirms that
        man is his soul, that the term soul is taken both universally and
        singularly, as soul and this soul; and the term man is also taken both
        universally and particularly, i.e., singularly, as man and as this man.
        And similarly, too, according to the opinion which affirms that man is a
        composite of body and soul, it follows that, if simple things may be
        taken both universally and singularly, composites may also be taken both
        universally and singularly; for example, if the soul is this thing and
        the body is this thing, which are referred to in an unqualified sense as
        parts of the composite, it follows that the terms universal and
        particular, or singular, may be applied not only to the parts but also
        to the composite.
      </p>
      <p>1525. <span style="font-weight: bold">But whether</span> (638)</p>
      <p>
        He explains what still remains to be established about substances; and
        he gives the two issues which have to be dealt with. The first is this:
        when it has been established that the substance and whatness of sensible
        and material things are parts of the species, the next thing that has to
        be established is whether there is some substance besides the matter “of
        such substances,” i.e., of material and sensible substances, so that it
        is necessary to look for some other substance of these sensible things
        besides the one which has been dealt with; as some affirm that there are
        numbers existing apart from matter, “or something of the kind,” i.e.,
        that separate Forms or Ideas are the substances of these sensible
        things. This must be investigated later on (Books XIII and XIV).
      </p>
      <p>
        1526. For this investigation is the one proper to this science, because
        in this science we attempt to establish something about sensible
        substances “for the sake of these,” i.e., for the sake of immaterial
        substances, because the study of sensible and material substances
        belongs in a sense to the philosophy of nature, which is not first
        philosophy, but second philosophy, as was stated in Book IV (323:C 593).
        For first philosophy is concerned with the first substances, which are
        immaterial ones, which it studies not only inasmuch as they are
        substances but inasmuch as they are such substances, namely, inasmuch as
        they are immaterial. But it does not study sensible substances inasmuch
        as they are such substances but inasmuch as they are substances, or also
        beings, or inasmuch as we are led by such substances to a knowledge of
        immaterial substances. But the philosopher of nature, on the other hand,
        deals with material substances, not inasmuch as they are substances, but
        inasmuch as they are material and have a principle of motion within
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        1527. And because someone might think that the philosophy of nature
        should not treat of material and sensible substances in their entirety,
        but only of their matters, he therefore rejects this, saying that the
        philosophy of nature must consider not only matter but also the part
        “which is intelligible,” namely, the form. And it must also consider
        form more than matter, because form is nature to a greater degree than
        matter, as was proved in Book II of the <i>Physics</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        1528. Second, it remains to be established how “the parts in the
        intelligible expression,” i.e., in the definition, are disposed: whether
        they are parts of the substance actually. And it also remains to be
        established why the definition, when it is composed of many parts, is
        one intelligible expression; for it is evident that the definition of a
        thing must be only one intelligible expression, because a thing is one,
        and a definition signifies what a thing is. But how a thing having parts
        is one must be investigated later (733:C 1755).
      </p>
      <p>1529. <span style="font-weight: bold">We have stated</span> (639).</p>
      <p>
        Next he sums up the points which have been established. He says that it
        has been stated what the essence of a thing is, and how it is predicated
        of all things, and that it is predicated essentially. And it has also
        been stated why the intelligible expression signifying the essence of
        some things contains in itself the parts of the thing defined, just as
        the definition of a syllable contains its letters, and “why that of
        others does not,” as the definition of a circle does not contain
        semicircles. And again it has also been stated that those parts which
        are material parts of substance are not given “in the intelligible
        expression of substance,” i.e., of form, because such parts are not
        “parts of that substance,” i.e., of the form, but are parts of the whole
        composite.
      </p>
      <p>
        1530. Now in one sense there is a definition of this kind of composite,
        and in another sense there is not; for if it is taken “with matter,”
        namely, the individual, there is no definition of it, since singulars
        are not defined, as was stated above (627: C 1493). The reason is that
        such individual matter is something unlimited and indeterminate; for
        matter is limited only by form. But if composite is taken “with
        reference to the primary substance,” i.e., to form, it has a definition;
        for the composite is defined when taken specifically, but not when taken
        individually.
      </p>
      <p>
        1531. And just as the individual is individuated by matter, in a similar
        fashion each thing is placed in its proper species by its form; for man
        is man, not because he has flesh and bones, but because he has a
        rational soul in this flesh and these bones. It is necessary, then, that
        the definition of the species should be taken from the form, and that
        only those material parts should be given in the definition of the
        species, in which the form has the primary and chief role, as the
        intelligible expression of man is one which contains soul; for man is
        man because he has such a soul. And for this reason, if man is defined,
        he must be defined by his soul, yet in his definition one must include
        the parts of the body in which the soul is first present, such as the
        heart or the brain, as was said above (626:C 1489).
      </p>
      <p>
        1532. For the substance, of which matter is not a part, “is the
        specifying principle,” i.e., the form, which is present in matter; and
        from this form and matter “the whole substance” is derived, i.e., made
        determinate and defined; for example, concavity is a form of this kind,
        for from this and from nose snubnose and snubness are derived. And in
        the same way man and humanity are derived from soul and body. For if
        nose, which plays the part of matter, were part of curvature, then when
        curved nose is referred to, the term nose would be expressed twice; for
        it is expressed once by its own name, and it is included again in the
        definition of the curved. However, this would be the case if nose were
        placed in the definition of the curved as part of the essence of
        curvature, and not by addition, as was stated above (624:C 1472). And
        even though matter is not present in the essence of form, it is
        nevertheless present in the whole composite substance; for example,
        curvature is present in snub nose, and individual matter is also present
        in Callias.
      </p>
      <p>
        1533. It was also said above (591:C 1362) that the essence of each thing
        is the same as the thing of which it is the essence. This is true
        without qualification in some cases, “as in the case of primary
        substances,” i.e., in that of immaterial substances, just as curvature
        itself is the same as the essence of curvature, provided that curvature
        belongs to primary substances. He says this because curvature seems to
        be a form in matter, though not in sensible matter but in an
        intelligible matter—continuous quantity. Or, according to another text,
        “which is first”; for there is a primary curvature, like the curvature
        which exists among the separate Forms, according to the Platonists, and
        of these Forms it is universally true that each is the same as its own
        essence. But the other curvature which is present in sensible things or
        in the objects of mathematics is not a primary one. Hence it is not the
        same as its essence.
      </p>
      <p>
        1534. And in explaining this he says that he does not use the term
        primary substance here to mean a particular substance, as he does in the
        <i>Categories</i>, but to mean something which does not exist in
        something else “as in a subject or matter,” i.e., those things which are
        not forms in matter, such as the separate substances. But all those
        which have the nature of matter or are conceived with matter, such as
        composites, which have matter in their intelligible expression, are not
        the same as their essence. Nor do those predications which are
        accidental form a unity, as Socrates and musician are the same
        accidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        1535. Now it must be noted that from the opinion which he expressed here
        that each thing and its essence are the same, he now excludes two kinds
        of things: (1) things which are accidental, and (2) substances which are
        material, although above he excluded only those things which are said to
        be accidental. And it is necessary not only to exclude the former but
        also to exclude material substances; for, as was said above (622:C
        1460), what the definition signifies is the essence, and definitions are
        not assigned to individuals but to species; and therefore individual
        matter, which is the principle of individuation, is distinct from the
        essence. But in reality it is impossible for a form to exist except in a
        particular substance. Hence if any natural thing has matter which is
        part of its species, and this pertains to its essence, it must also have
        individual matter, which does not pertain to its essence. Therefore, if
        any natural thing has matter, it is not its own essence but is something
        having an essence; for example, Socrates is not humanity but something
        having humanity. And if it were possible for a man to be composed of
        body and soul and not be this particular man composed of this body and
        this soul, he would still be his own essence, even though he contained
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1536. Now even though man does not exist apart from singular men in
        reality, nevertheless man is separable in his intelligible expression,
        which pertains to the domain of logic. Therefore, above (578:C 1308),
        where he considered essence from the viewpoint of logic, he did not
        exclude material substances from being their own essence; for man as a
        universal is the same as his essence, logically speaking. And now having
        come to natural principles, which are matter and form, and having shown
        how they are related to the universal in different ways, and to the
        particular thing which subsists in nature, he now excludes material
        substances, which exist in reality, from the statement which he had made
        above to the effect that the essence of a thing is the same as the thing
        of which it is the essence. Moreover it follows that those substances
        which are subsistent forms alone do not have any principle individuating
        them which is extrinsic to the intelligible expression (of the thing or
        of the species) which signifies their whatness. Concerning these things,
        then, it is true that each is unqualifiedly the same as its own
        essence.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        640. And now let us speak first of definition insofar as it has not been
        discussed in the <i>Analytics</i>; for the problem mentioned there
        constitutes a preamble to the arguments about substance. And by this
        problem I mean: for what reason is that thing one whose intelligible
        expression we call a definition? For example, two-footed animal is the
        definition of man; for let this be his intelligible expression. Why,
        then, is this one thing and not many, namely, animal and two-footed?
      </p>
      <p>
        641. For man and white are many since the latter is not present in the
        former; but they are one when the latter is present in the former, and
        the subject, man, is the recipient of some attribute; for then one thing
        is produced, and this is white man. But in this case one does not
        participate in the other; a genus does not participate in its
        differences, for then the same thing would participate in contraries;
        for the differences by which a genus is distinguished are contraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        642. And even if it does not participate in them, the same argument
        applies if the differences are many, for example, capable of walking,
        two-footed and wingless. For why are all these one and not many? It is
        not because they are found in one thing, because then one thing will he
        composed of all differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        643. But all the elements of a definition must be one, because a
        definition is one intelligible expression and one substance. Hence it
        must be the intelligible expression of some one particular thing; for
        substance signifies one thing and a particular thing, as we have said
        (582).
      </p>
      <p>
        644. Now it is necessary first to examine those definitions which are
        attained by the process of division. For there is nothing in a
        definition except the primary genus and the differences; and the other
        genera consist of the so-called primary genus and the differences
        included in this; for example, the primary genus is animal, and the next
        is two-footed, and the next is two-footed animal without wings. And the
        same thing also applies if a definition is expressed by many terms. And
        on the whole it makes no difference whether it is expressed by many or
        by few, or whether it is expressed by few or by two. Of the two, then,
        the one is the difference and the other the genus; for example, in the
        expression “two-footed animal,” animal is the genus and the other term
        is the difference. Hence, if a genus in an unqualified sense does not
        exist apart from those things which are its species, or if it has the
        nature of matter (for the spoken word is both a genus and matter, and
        the differences make the species, i.e., the letters, out of this), it is
        clear that the definition is the intelligible expression composed of the
        differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        645. Again, it is necessary too that a difference should be divided by a
        difference, as “having feet” is a difference of animal; and it is
        necessary also to know the difference of animal having feet, inasmuch as
        it has feet. Therefore, if someone is to speak correctly of something
        having feet, he must not say that one kind is winged and another
        wingless; and if he does say this it will be because of incompetence.
        But he will speak correctly only if he says that one kind has cloven
        feet and the other not; because these are the differences of the
        difference having feet, since a cloven foot is a certain kind of foot.
        And one always wants to proceed in this way until he comes to the
        species which have no differences; and then there will be as many
        species of foot as there are differences, and the species of animals
        having feet will be equal in number to the differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        646. If these things are so, then, it is evident that the ultimate
        difference will be the substance and definition of the thing, if the
        same thing is not to be expressed many times over in definitive
        expressions, because this is superfluous. However, this sometimes
        happens, for when one says “two-footed animal having feet,” he has said
        nothing more than animal having feet and having two feet. And if he
        divides this by its proper difference, he will express the same thing
        many times, and equal in number to the differences. If, then, a
        difference of a difference may be produced, the one which is the
        ultimate difference will be the specific form and substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        647. But if the division is made according to what is accidental, as if
        one were to divide what has feet into what is white and what is black,
        there will be as many differences as there are divisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        648. Hence it is evident that the definition is an intelligible
        expression composed of differences, and that it is composed of the last
        of these if the definition is formed correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        649. Moreover, this will be evident if we change the order of the words
        in such definitions, for example, in the definition of man by saying
        “two-footed animal having feet”; for having feet is superfluous when
        two-footed has been stated. But there is no sequence of parts in
        substance, for how are we to understand that one part is subsequent and
        the other prior? Therefore with regard to those definitions which are
        formed by the process of division, let this much be a preliminary
        statement of the kind of things they are.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1537. After having shown what parts are given in definitions, here the
        Philosopher inquires how a definition, being composed of parts, can be
        one thing; and in regard to this he does three things. First (640:C
        1537), he raises a question. Second (641:C 1538), he argues on one side
        (“For man”). Third (644:C 1542), he answers the question (“Now it is
        necessary”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says that with regard to definition we should speak now
        for the first time of the things which have not been stated about it “in
        the Analytics,” i.e., in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>. For in that
        work a certain difficulty was raised about definition and left unsolved,
        and this must be answered here “because it constitutes a preamble to the
        arguments about substance,” i.e., because the answer to this question is
        a prerequisite for establishing certain things about substance, which is
        the chief concern of this science. This difficulty is why the thing of
        which the intelligible expression, namely, the quiddity, is a
        definition, “is one thing.” For a definition is an intelligible
        expression signifying a quiddity; for example, the definition of man is
        “two-footed animal,” for let us assume that this is his definition.
        Therefore the question is: why is this thing which is called two-footed
        animal one thing and not many?
      </p>
      <p>1538. <span style="font-weight: bold">For man</span> (641).</p>
      <p>
        Then he raises arguments on both sides of the question; and he does
        this, first (641:C 1538), in order to show that one thing is not
        produced from them; and second (643:C 1540, to show that the contrary is
        true (“But all the elements”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows that one
        thing is not produced from a genus and a difference. Second (642:C
        1539), he shows that one thing is not produced from many differences
        (“And even if”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (641), that these two things, man and white,
        are many when one of them is not present in the other; for, if white
        does not belong to man, then man and white are one in no way. But they
        are one when one of them is present in the other, and when the subject,
        man, “is the recipient of the other,” i.e., when it receives the
        modification, white; and then something accidentally one is produced
        from these two things, namely, a white man. Now from these remarks it is
        understood that one thing is not produced from two things when one does
        not exist in the other. But “in this case,” namely, when one speaks of
        two-footed animal, “one,” i.e., animal, does not participate “in the
        other,” namely, in two-footed, as white man participates in white. And
        this is so because animal is a genus and two-footed is a difference. But
        a genus does not seem to participate in differences, for it would follow
        that the same thing would participate in contraries at the same time;
        for differences are the contraries “by which a genus is distinguished,”
        i.e., by which a genus is divided; and for the same reason that it
        participates in one it will participate in the other. But if it is
        impossible for the same thing to participate in contraries, it will be
        impossible for one thing to be produced from a genus and a difference.
      </p>
      <p>1539. <span style="font-weight: bold">And even if</span> (642).</p>
      <p>
        Then he shows that one thing cannot be produced from many differences.
        He says that, even if it is admitted that a genus participates in some
        way in a difference (as, for example, animal is not taken under its
        common aspect but insofar as it is restricted to a species by a
        difference, and then one thing is produced from a genus and a
        difference), the same argument can still be used to show that a
        definition does not signify one thing, if many differences are given in
        the definition; for example, if in the definition of man these three
        differences are given: first, capable of walking or having feet, second,
        two-footed, and third, wingless; for it cannot be said why these things
        are one and not many.
      </p>
      <p>
        1540. For to explain this it is not enough to give as a reason that they
        exist in one thing (as in the animal, man), because in this way it would
        follow that all accidents which inhere in any subject would be
        essentially one thing; for we do speak of one accident in relation to
        another accident as well as to the subject. And since those things which
        are accidents of one subject may also be accidents of another subject,
        it would follow that those two subjects would be one, for example, snow
        and a swan, in both of which whiteness is found. And thus by inference
        it would follow that all things would be one. Hence it cannot be said
        that one thing is produced from many differences, even though one thing
        is produced from a genus and a difference. Hence it seems that a
        definition does not signify one thing composed of two parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        1541. <span style="font-weight: bold">But all the elements</span> (643).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he argues one side of the question, showing that a definition does
        signify one thing. He says that all the attributes which are given in a
        definition must be one. And this is so because a definition is one
        intelligible expression, and what it signifies is the substance of a
        thing. Hence a definition must be an intelligible expression signifying
        one thing, because the substance of a thing, which the definition
        signifies, is one quiddity. And it was also stated above (582:C 1330,
        where definition was shown to belong properly to substances, that a
        definition signifies a particular thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        1542. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now it is necessary</span> (644).
      </p>
      <p>
        He answers the foregoing question by showing that a definition signifies
        one thing; and in regard to this he does two things. First (644), he
        shows how one thing is produced from a genus and a difference; and
        second (645:C 1551), how one thing is produced from many differences
        (“Again, it is”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (644), that in order to investigate the unity
        of definitions it is necessary, first, to examine definitions which are
        based on the division of genus into differences. For those are true
        definitions which contain nothing but the primary genus and differences,
        because some definitions are based on certain accidents, or on certain
        properties, or also on certain extrinsic causes, which do not signify
        the substance of a thing. Hence such definitions are not to the point,
        since here he is treating of definitions with a view to investigating
        the substances of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1543. Therefore I say that in a definition there is a primary genus with
        differences, because, even if one sometimes gives in definitions certain
        intermediate genera between the primary genus, which is the most
        general, and the last species which are defined, nevertheless those
        intermediate genera are nothing but the primary genus and the
        differences included in the understanding of the intermediate genus
        “along with this,” i.e., along with the primary genus; as when animal,
        which is an intermediate genus, is given in the definition of man, it is
        evident that animal is nothing but substance, which is the primary
        genus, along with certain differences; for an animal is a living
        sensible substance. And the case is the same when we understand the
        primary genus to be animal “having feet”; and again when we understand
        the third genus to be “two-footed animal without wings.” And the same
        thing is true when any genus is limited by many differences; for a
        subsequent genus always includes a prior genus along with some
        difference. Hence it is evident that every definition is dissolved into
        a primary genus and certain differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        1544. And in general it makes no difference whether the thing defined is
        defined by many terms or by few. Hence it makes no difference whether it
        is defined by few or by two, so long as one of these is a genus and the
        other a difference; for animal is the genus of two-footed animal, and
        the other term, namely, two-footed, is the difference. Therefore it must
        shown, first, how one thing is produced from these. This becomes clear
        as follows.
      </p>
      <p>
        1545. A genus does not exist apart from the things which are its
        species, for no animal is found which is not a man or an ox or some
        other animal of this kind. Or if there is something which is a genus
        apart from its species, taken in the sense that it exists apart from its
        species, it is not a genus but matter, because it is possible for
        something to be both the genus and matter of certain things, as the
        vocal sound is both the genus of letters and their matter. That it is a
        genus is evident from the fact that differences added to the vocal sound
        make the species of articulate sounds; and that it is matter is evident
        because the differences “make the elements,” i.e., the letters, “out of
        this,” namely, out of the vocal sound, as something is made out of
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1546. Moreover, it must be understood that while genus and matter can be
        the same in name, they nevertheless do not mean the same thing; for
        matter is an integral part of a thing, and thus cannot be predicated of
        a thing, for it cannot be said that man is flesh and bones. But a genus
        is predicated of its species, and therefore it must in some way signify
        the whole thing, just as matter along with its privation is sometimes
        designated by the simple name of the matter in view of the namelessness
        of privations, as it was said above (610:C 1416) that bronze is taken
        for formless bronze when we say that a statue is made of bronze; and in
        a similar fashion when the form is nameless, the composite of matter and
        form is designated by the simple name of the matter-not common matter,
        but some determinate matter. And in this way it is taken as a genus; for
        just as a species is a composite of matter and a determinate form, so
        too a genus is a composite of matter and a common form.
      </p>
      <p>
        1547. This becomes evident in many ways. For body can be taken both as
        the matter and as the genus of animal, because, if we understand in the
        notion of body a substance completed by its ultimate form, having in
        itself three dimensions, then body is a genus and its species are the
        complete substances determined by these ultimate forms, as that of gold,
        of silver, of olive, or of man. But if one considers in the notion of
        body only that it is a thing having three dimensions with an aptitude
        for an ultimate form, then body is matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1548. And the same thing applies in the case of a vocal sound; for if in
        the intelligible expression of vocal sound one includes the formation of
        sound in common according to the form which is subdivided into the
        different forms of the letters and syllables, then vocal sound is a
        genus. But if in the intelligible expression of vocal sound one
        understands only the substance of sound, to which the foregoing
        formation can accrue, then vocal sound will be the matter of the
        letters. From this it is also evident that vocal sound, which is a
        genus, cannot exist without species; for a sound can be formed only if
        it has the definite form of this or that letter. But if it lacked
        altogether the form of a letter insofar as it is matter, then it would
        be found without letters, just as bronze is found without the things
        which are produced from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        1549. If the foregoing statements are true, then, it is evident that a
        definition is an intelligible expression having unity from its
        differences in such a way that the whole essence of the definition is
        included in a certain way in the difference. For animal, which is a
        genus, cannot exist without species, because the forms of the species,
        the differences, are not different forms from the form of the genus but
        are the forms of the genus lacking determination; for example, it is
        evident that an animal is a thing having a sentient soul, that man is
        one having “such and such” a sentient soul, viz., with reason, and that
        a lion is one having “such and such” a soul, namely, with an abundance
        of daring. And it is the same in other cases. Hence, when a difference
        is added to a genus it is not added as though it were an essence
        distinct from the genus, but as though it were contained implicitly in
        the genus, as the determinate is contained in the indeterminate, for
        example, white in the thing colored.
      </p>
      <p>
        1550. And in the light of this the problem raised above (640:C 1537) is
        solved, since nothing prevents one and the same genus from containing
        within itself various differences, as the indeterminate contains within
        itself various determinate things. And in addition it is solved by
        reason of the fact that a difference does not accrue to a genus as
        constituting an essence distinct from it, as white accrues to man.
      </p>
      <p>1551. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, it is</span> (645).</p>
      <p>
        He next shows that a multitude of differences does not prevent a
        definition from being one; and in regard to this he does two things.
        First, he shows in what way a multitude of differences should be taken
        in a definition. Second (646:C 1555), he shows that, if differences are
        taken in the right way, a multitude of differences does not prevent a
        definition from being one (“If these things”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (645), that in the case of those definitions
        which include many differences not only should the genus be divided by a
        difference but the first difference should also be divided by the second
        difference; for example, footed is the difference of animal according to
        which animal is said to have feet or to be capable of walking; but since
        this difference is also found to have many forms, it is again necessary
        to know the difference of such an animal, i.e., what its difference is,
        “inasmuch as it has feet,” i.e., inasmuch as it is considered
        essentially and not accidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        1552. Therefore, since it is accidental to a thing having feet to have
        wings, it must not be said, in dividing the difference, that among those
        things which have feet, one kind is winged and another wingless, if a
        man wants to express correctly the division of the differences. Yet when
        someone in dividing differences “does this,” in such a way that he
        divides it by means of those attributes which are accidental, this is
        why he cannot find proper and essential differences. For sometimes
        necessity compels us to use accidental differences in place of essential
        differences inasmuch as accidental differences are the signs of certain
        essential differences unknown to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        1553. But this difference “having feet” must be divided in this way,
        namely, so that among animals of this kind one kind has cloven feet and
        another has not; for these, namely, cloven and uncloven, “are the
        differences of foot.” Therefore having cloven feet divides essentially
        the difference having feet; for a cloven foot “is a certain kind of
        foot,” i.e., the difference having cloven feet is something contained
        under the difference having feet; and they are related to each other as
        the determinate to the indeterminate, as we said of genus and
        difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        1554. And it is always necessary to proceed in this way in the division
        of differences until the one making the division “comes to the species
        which have no difference,” i.e., to ultimate differences, which are not
        divided further into other differences; and then there will be as many
        species of foot as there are differences, and the species of animals
        having feet will be equal in number to the differences; for any
        individual difference constitutes one ultimate species.
      </p>
      <p>1555. If these things (646).</p>
      <p>
        He shows here, from the things which have been set down, that a
        multitude of differences does not prevent a definition from being one.
        And in regard to this he does two things. First (646:C 1555), he proves
        his thesis. Second (648:C 1561), he draws the conclusion at which he
        aims (“Hence, it is evident”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he proves how one
        thing is produced from many differences, if differences are understood
        essentially. Second (647:C 1560), he shows that this cannot be the case
        if the differences are understood accidentally (“But if the division”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (646), that if the differences taken in a
        definition are such “as has been indicated,” i.e., so that differences
        are always taken essentially and not accidentally, it is obvious that
        the ultimate difference will constitute the whole substance of the thing
        and its entire definition; for it includes in itself all preceding
        parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        1556. For on the grounds that a genus does not exist without differences
        it has been shown that a genus is included in its differences. But that
        the ultimate difference includes all preceding differences is evident
        from the fact that unless this were affirmed to be so, it would follow
        that “in the definitive expressions of things,” i.e., in their
        definitions, the same thing would have to be expressed many times. This
        would be superfluous and meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
        1557. And this absurd conclusion follows because, if someone were to
        define an animal by saying “two-footed having feet” (as he must do if
        two-footed is a difference distinct from having feet and does not
        include it), when he defines it in this way he has said nothing but
        animal having feet having two feet; for two-footed is nothing but having
        two feet, in which the difference having feet is obviously included.
        Hence it is evident that, if both are used, we get nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
        1558. Moreover, if someone divides two-footed “by its proper
        difference,” i.e., by those things which are essential and not
        accidental, it follows further that the same thing is expressed many
        times, and as many times is the number of differences used, so that, if
        I say that one kind of two-footed animal is one which has a foot divided
        into five toes, and another kind is one which has a foot divided into
        four toes, anyone wishing to give all intermediate differences in
        defining man would express the same thing many times, and as often as he
        added differences; for he would say that man is an animal having feet,
        having two feet, having feet divided into five toes.
      </p>
      <p>
        1559. Now since these things are unacceptable, it is evident that, if
        differences are taken in a definition there will be one ultimate
        difference, namely, the one “which will be the specific form and
        substance,” i.e., which comprises the substance and specific form of the
        thing defined; and as a result of the unity of this difference the
        definition will be one.
      </p>
      <p>
        1560. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if the division</span> (647).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that the definition cannot be said to be one if the
        differences which are taken are accidental. He says that, if someone in
        dividing and defining were to take an accidental difference (for
        example, if things having feet were divided, one into black and another
        into white), there would be as many ultimate differences as the
        divisions which have been made, because one of them would not include
        another. And concerning differences taken in this way the argument
        introduced above was directed against the unity of the definition; for
        differences of this kind taken accidentally in this way would be one
        only in their subject, and this is not enough to account for the unity
        of the definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        1561. <span style="font-weight: bold">Hence it is evident</span> (648).
      </p>
      <p>
        He now concludes to his thesis; and in regard to this he does two
        things. First he gives his conclusion. He says that it is evident from
        the above discussions that, even though a genus and a difference are
        given in a definition, still a definition is an intelligible expression
        composed only of differences, because a genus is not something apart
        from its differences, as was stated above (644:C 1549). And even though
        many differences are given in a definition, still the entire definition
        depends on and is constituted by the ultimate difference, when the
        division is made “correctly,” i.e., by descending from more common to
        less common essential differences, and not by bringing in accidental
        differences from the side, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        1562.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Moreover, this will be evident</span>
        (649).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he clarifies by means of an example the conclusion which was
        drawn, saying “moreover this will be evident,” namely, that the entire
        definition consists in the ultimate difference, on the grounds that if
        anyone changes the parts of such definitions an absurdity results. Thus
        someone might say that the definition of man is a two-footed animal
        having feet. But as soon as two-footed has been expressed, it is
        superfluous to add having feet. But if one were to say first “having
        feet,” it would still be necessary to ask whether it was two-footed, by
        dividing the difference having feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        1563. From this it is evident that insofar as those differences are many
        they have a definite order among themselves. But this cannot mean that
        there is any order in the substance of a thing; for it cannot be said
        that this part of a substance is prior and another subsequent, because
        substance is complete all at once and not successively, except in the
        case of those things which are deficient in being, such as motion and
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        1564. Hence it is evident that a multiplicity of parts in a definition
        does not signify a multiplicity of essential parts of which the essence
        is constituted as if they were distinct things; but all signify one
        thing which is made determinate by an ultimate difference. It is also
        evident from this that there is one substantial form for every species.
        Thus there is one form of lion by which it is a substance, a body, a
        living body, an animal, and a lion; for if there were many forms
        corresponding to all the differences mentioned above, all could not be
        included under one difference, nor could one thing be composed of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        1565. Lastly he brings his discussion to a close with a summary. He says
        that with regard to definitions which are based on the divisions of
        genera into differences and of difference into differences, these points
        should constitute a preliminary statement “of the kinds of things they
        are”: they are composed of essential predicates, they contain in
        themselves the parts of the specific form, and each is also a unity. He
        says “preliminary” because in the following discussions certain points
        are established about definitions and quiddities.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        650. But since our investigation has to do with substance, let us return
        to it. And just as the subject and the essence and the composite of
        these are called substance, so also is the universal. Two of these,
        then, have been discussed already, namely, the essence (576-597;
        622-649) and the subject (568-575); and it has been stated that a thing
        is a subject in two ways: either as this particular thing (as an animal
        is the subject of its attributes), or as matter is the subject of
        actuality. But according to some thinkers the universal also seems to be
        in the fullest sense a cause and principle. Therefore let us treat of
        this.
      </p>
      <p>
        651. For it seems impossible that any of those things which are
        predicated universally should be substance. For, first, the substance of
        each thing is the substance which is proper to it and belongs to nothing
        else, whereas the universal is common; for that is said to be universal
        which is suited by its nature to be found in many things. Of what
        particular thing, then, will it be the substance? For it is either the
        substance of all or of one. But it cannot be the substance of all. And
        if it is the substance of one, all things will also be that one; for
        those things whose substance is one have one essence and are themselves
        one.
      </p>
      <p>
        652. Furthermore, substance means what is not predicated of a subject,
        whereas a universal is always predicated of some subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        653. But while a universal cannot be a substance in the way in which the
        essence of a thing is, it is found in this in the way in which animal is
        found in man and in horse. Therefore it is evident that it has some kind
        of intelligible expression. However, it makes no difference if there is
        no definitive expression of all those things which are present in
        substance; for none the less this will be the substance of something, as
        man is the substance of the particular man in whom it is present. Hence
        the same thing will happen again, for substance will be the substance of
        that thing, as animal will be the substance of that in which it is
        present as its proper form.
      </p>
      <p>
        654. Furthermore, it is both impossible and absurd that this particular
        thing, or substance, if it is composed of certain parts, should not be
        composed of substances or of a particular thing but of quality; for that
        which is not substance, i.e., quality, will then be prior both to
        substance and to the particular thing itself. But this is impossible;
        for accidental attributes cannot be prior to substance either in
        intelligibility or in time or in the process of generation; for they
        would then be separable from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        655. Furthermore, Socrates will have a substance in his substance, and
        therefore it will be the substance of two things. And in general it
        follows, if man and all terms used in this way are substance, that no
        one of the parts in the intelligible expression is the substance of
        anything, nor does it exist apart from the species or in anything else.
        And I mean that there is no animal existing apart from particular ones,
        and the same is true of everything contained in the intelligible
        expressions of things. From these considerations it is evident to those
        who study the matter that no universal is a substance, and that none of
        the categories signify particular things but things of such and such a
        kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        656. And if this is not the case, many absurdities will follow, among
        them the third man (107).
      </p>
      <p>
        657. Furthermore it is also evident in this way that a substance cannot
        be composed of substances which are actually present in it, for what is
        actually two can never be actually one; but if something is potentially
        two, it will be actually one; for example, the whole line consists of
        two halves existing potentially. For actuality separates. Hence, if
        substance is one it will not consist of substances present in it. And in
        this sense Democritus is right; for he says that it is impossible for
        one thing to be produced from two, or two from one; because he makes
        indivisible continuous quantities substances. It is evident, then, that
        the same thing will also be true of numbers if a number is a composite
        of units as some say, because either the number two is not one or the
        unit is actually present in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        658. But the result involves a difficulty; for if no single substance
        can consist of universals (because a universal signifies such and such a
        thing but not a particular thing), and if no single substance can be
        composed of actual substances, then every substance will lack
        composition. Hence no substance will have an intelligible expression.
        But it appears to all, and this has already been stated (587), that it
        is either substance alone or chiefly substance that is defined. But now
        it seems that not even this kind of substance is defined. Hence there
        will be no definition of anything, or in one sense there will be and in
        another there will not. The meaning of this will become clearer from
        what follows (669-676; 733-741).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1566. Having settled the issue about substance in the sense of quiddity,
        the Philosopher now comes to certain conclusions about substance insofar
        as the universal is considered by some thinkers to be a substance; and
        in regard to this he does two things. First (650:C 1566), he links up
        this discussion with the preceding one. Second (651:C 1569), he carries
        out his plan (“For it seems”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He therefore says, first (650), that since this science is chiefly
        concerned with the study of substance, we must return again to the
        division of substance in order to see what has been said and what
        remains to be said. Now it is clear from the preceding discussion that
        substance has the following meanings. First, it means what has the
        nature “of a subject,” namely, matter, which is related to substantial
        form in the same way as a subject, which is a complete substance, is
        related to accidental form; second, it means the essence of a thing,
        which refers to its form; third, it means “the composite of these,”
        i.e., the composite of matter and form; and fourth, it means the
        universal, according to some thinkers.
      </p>
      <p>
        1567. Now the division of substance given here is the same as that given
        at the beginning of Book VII (568:C 1270), although it seems to differ;
        for there he gave four senses of substance: the subject, the essence,
        the universal and the genus. And he divided subject into three meanings:
        matter, form, and the composite. And since it has already been made
        clear that essence derives from form, he puts essence in place of form;
        and again since a common genus is said to be substance on the same
        grounds as a universal is, as will be shown, he concludes that both
        belong in the same class; and thus there remain only the four senses in
        which substance is spoken of here.
      </p>
      <p>
        1568. Two of these, then, have been discussed already; for essence has
        been treated (576:C 1299) and also the subject (568:C 1270), which is
        taken in two senses. For, first, it means a particular thing and an
        actual being, as animal is the subject of its predicates, and as any
        particular substance is the subject of its accidents. Second, it means
        primary matter, which is “the subject of actuality,” i.e., of
        substantial form. These things were discussed where it was shown (629:C
        1501) how the parts of matter pertain to the form and to the individual.
        But since not only the matter and the quiddity seem to be causes, but
        also the universal, because “according to some thinkers,” i.e., the
        Platonists, this seems to be in the fullest sense a cause and principle,
        we will therefore -treat “of this,” i.e., the universal, in this same
        seventh book. And in Book VIII (691:C 1681) we will treat of composite
        and sensible substances, to which the things treated in this seventh
        book are related as principles.
      </p>
      <p>1569. For it seems (651).</p>
      <p>
        Here he begins to investigate whether universals are substances, and
        this is divided into two parts. In the first (651) he shows that
        universals are not substances, as some thinkers claimed. In the second
        (681:C 1642) he shows to what extent the statements of those making this
        claim are true and to what extent they are false (“But those who”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows in a general
        way that universals are not substances. Second (678:C 1637), he shows
        this in a special way with regard to being and unity, which were assumed
        to be the substances of thinars in the highest degree (“And since”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is divided into two parts. In the first he shows that
        universals are not substances; and in the second (659:C 1592), he shows
        that they are not separate entities (“And from these”).
      </p>
      <p>
        in regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows that
        universals cannot be substances on the grounds that they are predicated
        of many things; and second (654:C 1579), on the grounds that species are
        composed of universals as parts of their definition (“Furthermore, it
        is”). For he had said above, in Book V (524:C 1119), that in one sense a
        genus is a whole inasmuch as it is predicated of several things, and in
        another sense it is a part inasmuch as a species is composed of a genus
        and a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows that a
        universal is not a substance on the grounds that it is predicated of
        many things. Second (653:C 1577), he rejects a captious answer (“But
        while a universal”).
      </p>
      <p>
        1570. For the clarification of this chapter it must be noted that the
        term universal can be taken in two senses. First, it can be taken to
        mean the nature of the thing to which the intellect attributes the
        aspect of universality, and in this sense universals such as genera and
        species signify the substances of things inasmuch as they are predicated
        quidditatively; for animal signifies the substance of the thing of which
        it is predicated, and so also does man. Second, a universal can be taken
        insofar as it is universal, and insofar as the nature predicated of a
        thing falls under the aspect of universality, i.e., insofar as animal or
        man is considered as a one-in-many. And in this sense the Platonists
        claimed that animal and man in their universal aspect constitute
        substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        1571. This is what Aristotle aims to disprove in this chapter by showing
        that animal in general or man in general is not a substance in reality,
        but that the form animal or man takes on this generality insofar as it
        exists in the mind, which understands one form as common to many
        inasmuch as it abstracts it from all individuating principles. Hence in
        support of his thesis he gives two arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
        1572. Concerning the first of these (651) he says that in the light of
        the succeeding arguments it seems impossible that any one of those
        attributes which are predicated universally should be a substance, i.e.,
        insofar as it is taken in its universality. This is proved, first, by
        the fact that while the substance of each thing is proper to each and
        does not belong to something else, a universal is common to many; for
        that is said to be universal which belongs by nature to many things and
        is predicated of many. Hence, if a universal is substance it must be the
        substance of some thing. Of what thing, then, will it be the substance?
        For it must either be the substance of all the things to which it
        belongs or of one. But it is impossible for it to be the substance of
        all things, because one thing cannot be the substance of many, since
        those things are many whose substances are many and distinct.
      </p>
      <p>
        1573. But if it is held to be the substance of one of the things in
        which it is found, it follows that all other things in which it is
        found, and of which it is held to be the substance, are that one thing;
        because it must also be their substance for the same reason, since it is
        found in all in the same way. Now those things of which the substance
        and essence are one must also be one themselves. Hence, since a
        universal cannot be the substance of all the things of which it is
        predicated or of any one of them, it follows that it is not the
        substance of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        1574. Now it should be noted that he describes a universal as what is
        naturally disposed to exist in many, and not as what exists in many;
        because there are some universals which contain under themselves only
        one singular thing, for example, sun and moon. But this is not to be
        understood in the sense that the very nature of the species, considered
        in itself, is not naturally disposed to exist in many things; but there
        is something else which prevents this, as the fact that all the matter
        of the species is included in one individual, and the fact that it is
        not necessary that a species which can last forever in a single
        individual should be numerically many.
      </p>
      <p>
        1575.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Furthermore, substance</span> (652).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives his second reason. He says that substance refers to
        something which is not predicated of a subject. But a universal is
        something which is always predicated of some subject. Therefore a
        universal is not a substance. But this argument seems not to be cogent,
        for it is said in the Categories ‘ that it belongs to the notion of
        substance not to exist in a subject. But to be predicated of a subject
        is not opposed to the notion of substance. Hence in that place second
        substances are posited, and these are predicated of a subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        1576. But it must be said that in the <i>Categories</i> the Philosopher
        is speaking from the viewpoint of logic. Now a logician considers things
        insofar as they exist in the mind, and therefore he considers substances
        insofar as they take on the character of universality from the way in
        which the intellect understands them. Hence in reference to predicating,
        which is an act of reason, he says that substance is predicated “of a
        subject,” i.e., of a substance subsisting outside of the mind. But the
        first philosopher considers things insofar as they are beings, and
        therefore in his view of the matter there is no difference between
        existing in a subject and being predicated of a subject. For he takes
        something to be predicated of a subject which is something in itself and
        belongs to some actually existing subject. And it is impossible that
        this be a substance, for then it would have to exist in a subject. But
        this is contrary to the notion of substance, as is also stated in the
        <i>Categories</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        1577.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But while a universal</span> (653).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he rejects the captious answer by which someone might oppose his
        first argument, in which he had said that all things are one whose
        substance and quiddity are one. For someone might say that a universal
        is not a substance in the sense of the essence of a thing, which is
        proper to one thing. Therefore with a view to rejecting this the
        Philosopher says “But while” it might be said, in opposition to the
        first argument introduced, that it is impossible for a universal to be a
        substance in the way in which an essence is, it is substance only as
        something existing in these particular things, as animal exists in man
        anti in horse. For the nature of animal is not found in man in such a
        way that it is proper to him, because it is also found in horse—as if to
        say that the argument cannot be answered in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        1578. For if animal in common is a substance, it follows that there is
        an intelligible expression of this substance. And it makes no difference
        to his thesis if there is no definitive expression of all those things
        “which are present in substance,” i.e., which are given in the
        definition, test there be an infinite regress in definitions, but all
        parts of any definition must be further defined. For this substance must
        be the substance of something, even though it does not have a
        definition, no less than if it has. Thus we might say that, although man
        in common does not have a definition, it must nevertheless be the
        substance of the man in whom it is present, namely, of man in common.
        Hence the same conclusion follows as before, because, even though this
        common substance is not held to be proper to any one of its inferiors,
        it must still be proper to that common substance in which it is first
        found. For example, if animal in common is a substance, animal will be
        predicated primarily of that common substance and will signify its
        proper substance, whether it be definable or not. Hence, since this
        substance is proper to one thing, it will be impossible for it to be
        predicated of many things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1579. <span style="font-weight: bold">Furthermore, it is</span> (654).
      </p>
      <p>
        He now shows that the universal is not a substance by basing his
        arguments on the grounds that the universal is part of the definition
        and essence. In regard to this he does two things. First (654:C 1579),
        he gives the arguments in support of his thesis. Second (658:C 1590), he
        disposes of a difficulty (“But the result”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first part he gives four arguments. First, he says that
        it is both impossible and untenable that a particular thing and a
        substance should not be composed of substances or particular things but
        of those things which signify quality—if it is composed of anything
        (which he adds to allow for simple substances). For since those parts of
        which a thing is composed are prior to it, it follows that what is not
        substance but quality is prior both to substance and to this particular
        thing. But this is impossible, because it is impossible for
        modifications and qualities and accidents to be prior to substance
        either in intelligibility or in time or in generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        1580. For it has been shown above (563:C 1253) that they are not prior
        in intelligibility, because substance is given in the definition of
        accidents, and not the reverse. And from this it has also been proved
        above (563:C 1257) that they are not prior in time. From this in turn he
        further proves here that it would follow that attributes would be
        capable of existing apart from substances; and this is impossible. And
        priority in generation comes under priority in time, although the
        reverse is not true. For even though things which are not related to the
        generation of something are prior in time, they are’ still not prior in
        generation; for example, a horse is not prior in generation to a lion
        which exists at this moment, even though it is prior to it in time.
        However, the parts of which a thing is composed are prior in the process
        of generation and therefore in time, and sometimes also in
        intelligibility, as was shown above (570:C 1278). Hence it is impossible
        that substances should be composed of things which are not substances.
        But universals do not signify particular things, but of what sort things
        are, as was said about second substances in the <i>Categories</i>. It is
        evident, then, that singular things, which are particulars, cannot be
        composed of universals if these are some kind of things which exist
        apart from singulars.
      </p>
      <p>
        1581. But it seems that this argument is not a satisfactory one; for
        even though second substances, which are genera and species in the genus
        of substance, do not signify particular things but of what sort things
        are, nevertheless they do not signify of what sort things are in the
        same way in which attributes that signify accidental quality do, but
        they signify substantial quality. However, he argues here as if they
        signified accidental quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        1582. But it must be said that if universals are things, as the
        Platonists claimed, we shall have to say that they signify not only
        substantial quality but also accidental quality; for every quality which
        is distinct from the thing of which it is the quality, is accidental.
        For example, whiteness differs from the body of which it is a quality,
        and it inheres in the body of which it is the quality as its subject;
        and therefore it is an accident. Hence, if universals as universals are
        things, they must be distinct from singulars, which are not universals.
        Therefore, if they signify the quality of those things, they must inhere
        in them as in substances and thus must signify accidental quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        1583. However, for those who claim that genera and species are not
        things or natures distinct from singulars but are the singular things
        themselves (for example, that there is no man who is not this man), it
        does not follow that second substance signifies an accident or
        modification.
      </p>
      <p>
        1584.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Furthermore, Socrates</span> (655).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the second argument. He says that if universals are substances,
        it follows that Socrates will have a substance in his substance; for if
        all universals are substances, then just as man is the substance of
        Socrates, in a similar fashion animal will be the substance of man; and
        thus these two substances, one of which is man and the other animal,
        will exist in Socrates. His conclusion is “and therefore it will be the
        substance of two things,” i.e., it therefore follows that animal is the
        substance not only of man but also of Socrates. Hence one substance will
        belong to two things. Yet it has been shown above that one thing has
        only one substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1585. And the result mentioned applies not only in the case of Socrates
        but universally in all cases. For if man and the other things which are
        called species in this way are substances, it also follows that no one
        of the parts in the intelligible structure of a species is substance,
        and that it cannot exist without the species in whose definitions it is
        given or exist in anything else; just as there is no animal “apart from
        particular animals,” i.e., apart from the species of animal. And the
        same thing applies to all other predicates which are given in
        definitions, whether they are genera or differences. And this is true
        because, if those parts which are given in the definitions of species
        are substances, then since species are substances there will be many
        substances in singular things, and many things will have one substance;
        as was said about Socrates. From what has been said, then, it is evident
        that no universal is a substance, and that common predicates do not
        signify a particular thing but of what sort a thing is.
      </p>
      <p>1586. <span style="font-weight: bold">And if this</span> (656).</p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the third argument. He says that, if the preceding
        conclusion is not admitted, many absurdities will follow, and one of
        these will be the need to posit a third man. This can be explained in
        two ways. First, it can mean that besides the two singular men, Socrates
        and Plato, there is a third man, who is common to both. This is not
        absurd according to those who posit Ideas, although it seems absurd from
        the viewpoint of right reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        1587. Second, it can be explained as meaning that there is posited a
        third man besides a singular man and man in common, since they have a
        common name and intelligible expression, just as do two singular men in
        addition to whom a third common man is posited; and the reason is that
        they have a common name and definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        1588. <span style="font-weight: bold">Furthermore, it is</span> (657).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the fourth argument. He says that universals are not substances
        for this reason that it is impossible that a substance should be
        composed of many substances actually present in it; for two actual
        things are never one actual thing, but two which are in potentiality are
        one actually, as is clear of the parts of a continuous quantity. The two
        halves of one line, for instance, exist potentially in the whole line,
        which is one actually. And this is because actuality has the power of
        separating and distinguishing; for one thing is distinguished from
        another by its proper form. Hence in order that many things may become
        one actual thing, it is necessary that all should be included under one
        form, and that each one should not have its own form by which it would
        exist in act. Hence it is evident that if a particular substance is one,
        it will not be composed of substances actually present in it; and thus
        if it is composed of universals, universals will not be substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        1589. And in this sense Democritus is right when he says that it is
        impossible for one thing to be produced from two, and two from one; for
        it must be borne in mind that two actual existents never make one. But
        in failing to distinguish between the potential and the actual, he
        claimed that indivisible continuous quantities are substances; for he
        thought that, just as one thing does not contain many things actually,
        neither does it contain them potentially; and thus any continuous
        quantity is indivisible. Or this might be explained differently. I mean
        that Democritus was right if we assume his own position to be true, in
        which he claimed that indivisible quantities are the substances of
        things and thus are always actual, and in this way no one thing is
        produced from them. And just as this is true in the case of continuous
        quantities, in a similar way it is true in the case of numbers, if
        number is composed of units, as some thinkers claimed. For either the
        number two (or any other number) is not one thing, or the unit is not
        actually present in it. Thus the number two will not be two units, but
        something composed of units; otherwise a number would not be a unity,
        essentially and properly, but only accidentally, like a heap.
      </p>
      <p>1590. <span style="font-weight: bold">But the result</span> (658).</p>
      <p>
        He poses a difficulty about the above answer. He says that the result of
        the foregoing discussion gives rise to a difficulty; for first (as was
        said), a substance cannot be composed of universals, because a universal
        does not signify a particular thing but of what sort a thing is; and
        second, a substance cannot be composed of actual substances; and thus it
        seems to follow that substances cannot be composed or made up of
        substances. It follows, then, that all substances lack composition. And
        thus, since no definitions are given of substances which lack
        composition (and this is clear from the fact that the definition is an
        intelligible expression having parts, as was shown above [622:C 1460]),
        it follows that no substance has a definition. But it seems to everyone,
        as was shown above (582:C 1331), that a definition is either of
        substance alone or chiefly of substance, and it has now been concluded
        that there is no definition of substance; hence it follows that there is
        no definition of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        1591. Now the answer to the above difficulty is that in one sense
        substance is composed of substances and in another it is not. But this
        will become clearer from the following discussions in this book (669:C
        1606) and in Book VIII; for substance is composed of potential
        substances, not of actual ones.<br /></p

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 14 1039a 24-1039b 19
      </p>
      <p>
        659. And from these facts it is evident what consequences face those who
        say that the Ideas are substances and are separable, and who also at the
        same time make the form out of genus and difference. For if there are
        Forms, and if animal exists in man and in horse, it is either one and
        the same numerically or different.
      </p>
      <p>
        660. For it is evident that they are one in their intelligible
        expression, for one will express the same notion in speaking of each.
        Therefore, if there is a man-in-himself, who is a particular thing and
        is separate, the things of which he is composed, such as animal and
        two-footed, must also signify particular things and be separable and be
        substances. Hence animal will also be such.
      </p>
      <p>
        661. If, then, the animal in horse and in man is one and the same, as
        you are in yourself, how can one thing be present in many things which
        exist separately?
      </p>
      <p>662. And why will this animal not exist apart from itself?</p>
      <p>
        663. Again, if it participates in two-footed and in many-footed, an
        impossible conclusion follows, for contrary attributes will belong at
        the same time to this thing which is one and a particular being. And if
        it does not, what mode of being is meant when one says that an animal is
        two-footed or is capable of walking? But perhaps they are combined or
        joined together or mixed. Yet all such views are untenable.
      </p>
      <p>
        664. But what will happen if there is a different animal in each? There
        will then be an infinite number of things whose substances is animal,
        for man does not come from animal accidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        655. Again, animal-in-itself will be many things; for the animal in each
        will be substance, since it is not predicated of anything else. But if
        this is not so, man will consist of that other thing, and that will be
        the genus of man.
      </p>
      <p>
        666. Further, all the things of which man is composed will be Ideas.
        Hence no one of them will be the Idea of one thing and the substance of
        something else, for this is impossible. Therefore animal-in-itself will
        be each of these things which are contained in animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        667. Again, from what is it derived? And how is it derived from
        animal-in-itself? Or how is it possible that the animal which is a
        substance should exist apart from animal-in-itself?
      </p>
      <p>
        668. Again, these are the conclusions which follow in the case of
        sensible things, and there are others more absurd than these. If it is
        impossible, then, that this should be so, it is evident that there is no
        Idea of these sensible things, as some affirm.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1592. Having shown that universals are not substances in an unqualified
        sense, here the Philosopher shows that they are not substances existing
        apart from sensible things. This is divided into two parts. In the first
        (659:C 1592) he shows that universals are not substances existing apart
        from sensible things. In the second (677:C 1630 he clears up a point
        which had remained a problem in the above discussion (“It is also”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows that
        universals are not separate substances. Second (669:C 1606), he shows
        that if they are separate they are not definable (“But since there
        are”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows the absurd
        consequences facing those who claim that universals are separate
        substances, by comparing genus with species; and second (668:C 1605), by
        comparing genus with individuals (“Again, these are”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he presents a
        division. Second (66o:C 1593), he proceeds to treat the first member of
        this division (“For it is evident”). Third (664:C 1600), he proceeds to
        treat the second member (“But what will happen”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He therefore says, first (659), that from what has been said above it is
        also possible to indicate the absurd conclusions facing those who say
        that the Ideas, which are said to be universal forms, are substances and
        are separable, and at the same time claim that a specific form is
        composed of genus and difference; for these two positions, when taken
        together, i.e., that forms are composed of genus and difference, and
        that universal forms are separate substances, called Ideas, lead to
        absurd consequences. For if forms are assumed to be separate, it follows
        that one genus exists in many species at the same time, as animal in man
        and in horse. Therefore, either this animal present in man and in horse
        is one and the same thing numerically, or there is one animal present in
        man and a different one present in horse. And he introduces this
        division because Plato claimed that there are Ideas of species but not
        of genera, even though he made the general claim that universals are
        substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        1593. <span style="font-weight: bold">For it is evident</span> (66o).
      </p>
      <p>
        He proceeds to treat the first member of this division. First, he shows
        that the animal present in man and that present in horse are one and the
        same. Second (661:C 1594), he explains the absurdities which follow from
        this position (“If, then”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (660), that it is evident that the animal
        present in man and that present in horse are one and the same in their
        intelligible expression; for if one states the intelligible expression
        of animal insofar as it is predicated of each, namely, of man and of
        horse, the same intelligible expression—living sensible substance—will
        be assigned to each of them; for a genus is predicated univocally of a
        species just as a species is also predicated univocally of individuals.
        Hence, if, because of the fact that species are predicated of all
        individuals according to one intelligible expression, there is a common
        man, who is man-in-himself, existing by himself, “and who is a
        particular thing,” i.e., something subsistent which can be pointed to
        and is separable from sensible things, as the Platonists maintained,
        then for a similar reason the things of which a species consists,
        namely, genus and difference, such as animal and two-footed, must also
        signify particular things and be separable from their own inferiors, and
        be substances existing by themselves. Hence it follows that animal will
        be one individual and subsistent thing, which is predicated of man and
        of horse.
      </p>
      <p>
        1594. <span style="font-weight: bold">If, then, the animal</span> (661).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he points out the absurdities which follow from this position; and
        there are three of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is that since a genus is present in a species as something
        signifying the substance of a thing, then animal will be present in
        horse as you are in yourself, who are your own substance. Now in this
        way it is not possible for some one thing to be present in many things
        which exist separately. For you are present only in yourself, since you
        are not in many things which exist separately, as in flesh and bones,
        which are your parts. Therefore, if animal is one and the same, it will
        be incapable of existing in many species, as in man and in horse, since
        the separate Forms, according to the Platonists, are substances which
        are distinct from each other.
      </p>
      <p>1595. <span style="font-weight: bold">And why will</span> (662).</p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second absurdity. For since man is one thing
        predicated of many, according to the Platonists, man is assumed not to
        be present in particular things but to exist outside of them. Hence, if
        there is one animal which is predicated of all species of animals, why
        will this universal animal-in-itself not exist apart from itself,
        namely, apart from horse or any other species of animal, as something
        existing separately by itself? No suitable explanation of this can be
        given by them.
      </p>
      <p>
        1596.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, if it participates</span> (663).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the third absurdity. He says that it is evident that a species
        is constituted of a genus and a difference. Therefore this is explained
        by the fact that a genus participates in a difference just as a subject
        participates in an accident. Thus we understand that man is made up of
        animal and two-footed in the same way that white man is made up of white
        and man. Or it is explained in some other way.
      </p>
      <p>
        1597. And if a species comes to be because a genus participates in a
        difference, so that animal by participating in two-footed becomes a man,
        and by participating in many-footed becomes a horse or an octopus, an
        impossible conclusion follows. For when a genus which is predicated of
        different species is held to be one substance, it follows that contrary
        attributes will be present at the same time in the same animal, which is
        one thing in itself and a particular being, namely, something capable of
        being pointed to; for the differences by which a genus is divided are
        contraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        1598. However, if man is not composed of animal and two-footed by way of
        participation, then when someone says that animal is two-footed or
        capable of walking, what will be the way in which one thing is
        constituted from these two? The implication is that the reason cannot be
        easily given. Therefore he adds “But perhaps they are combined,” which
        is equivalent to saying: will it be possible to affirm that one thing
        arises from these two as a result of their combination, as a house
        arises from stones; or by being joined together, as a chest comes from
        pieces of wood being fitted together; or by being mixed, as a lozenge
        comes from the alteration of different kinds of medications? For these
        are the three ways in which one thing is found to come from two or more
        things which exist as independent substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        1599. But all of these ways are unacceptable. For genus and difference
        could not be predicated of species, as parts which are combined, joined
        together and mixed are not predicated of their wholes. Furthermore, one
        thing does not enter as a whole into the composition of different
        things, but its parts exist separately, so that one part of it enters
        into the composition of this thing and another into the composition of
        something else, as one part of wood enters into the composition of a
        house and another into the composition of a chest. Hence if man and bird
        were to come from animal and from two-footed in the foregoing ways, it
        would follow that the whole nature of animal would not be present in man
        and in bird, but different parts would be present in each. And so,
        again, animal would not be the same in each.
      </p>
      <p>
        1600. <span style="font-weight: bold">But what will happen</span> (664).
      </p>
      <p>
        He now treats the second member of the division. He says that an
        absurdity follows if animal is not assumed to be one in all species of
        animals; and this leads to four impossible consequences. He gives the
        first by speaking as follows: the consequences facing those who claim
        that universals are substances when animal is assumed to be one in all
        species of animals, has been made clear. But because of this someone can
        say that there is a different animal in each species of animal; hence
        there will be an infinite number of things whose substance is animal,
        inasmuch as this follows from the statement of the foregoing position;
        for animal is the substance of any species contained under animal, since
        it cannot be said that man comes from animal accidentally but
        essentially. And thus animal pertains to the substance of horse and of
        ox and to that of the other species, which are almost infinite in
        number. But that some one thing should be present in the substance of an
        infinite number of things seems absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
        1601.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, animal-in-itself</span> (665).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second absurdity. He says that it also follows that
        “animal-in-itself,” i.e., the universal substance animal, will be many,
        because animal, which is present in each species of animal, is the
        substance of the species of which it is predicated; for it is not
        predicated of the species as of something else substantially different
        from itself. And if the term animal is not predicated of man as
        something different, it will be proper to say that man will be made up
        of it, i.e., have animal within himself as his own substance, and that
        the thing being predicated, i.e., animal, is also his genus, which is
        predicated of him quidditatively. Hence it follows that, just as those
        things of which animal is predicated are many, in a similar way the
        universal animal is itself many.
      </p>
      <p>
        1602.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, all the things</span> (666).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the third absurdity. He says that it also follows, from the
        things said above, that all the things of which man consists, namely,
        the higher genera and species, are Ideas; and this is opposed to the
        position of the Platonists, who claimed that only species are Ideas of
        particular things, and that genera and differences are not Ideas of
        species. They did this because an Idea is the proper exemplar of the
        thing produced from the Idea so far as the form of the thing is
        concerned. Now the form of a genus is not proper to that of its species
        as the form of a species is proper to its individuals, which are
        formally the same and materially different.
      </p>
      <p>
        1603. But if there are different animals for the different species of
        animals, then something in the substance of the genus of each species
        will correspond to each as its proper Idea; and thus genera also will be
        Ideas, and so will differences. Therefore it will not be characteristic
        of one of the universals to be an Idea and of another to be a substance,
        as the Platonists claimed when they said that genera are the substances
        of species and species the Ideas of individuals; for it is impossible
        that this should be so, as has been shown. From what has been said
        above, then, it follows “that animal in-itself,” i.e., the universal
        substance animal, is each of these things “which are contained in
        animals,” i.e. which are contained among the species of animal.
      </p>
      <p>1604. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again from what</span> (667).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the fourth absurdity. He says that there also seems to be
        a difficulty about the parts of which this thing, man, is composed; and
        how it is derived from “animal-in-itself,” namely, the universal animal;
        or “how is it possible that the animal which is a substance should exist
        apart from animal-in-itself,” i.e., how is it possible for man to be
        something apart from animal as a substance existing by itself and for it
        still to be true that animal is this very thing which is man? For these
        two views seem to be opposed, namely, that man exists apart from animal,
        and that animal is this very thing is man.
      </p>
      <p>
        1605. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, these are</span> (668).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he rejects the foregoing position by comparing genera to singular
        things. He says that the same absurd conclusions which face those who
        claim that genera and universals are the substances of species, also
        face those who hold genera to be the substances of singular sensible
        things (and there are even more absurd conclusions than these). And
        their claim is absurd inasmuch as the nature of a genus is more removed
        from sensible, material singulars than from intelligible and immaterial
        species. Hence, if it is impossible that this should be the case, it is
        clear that there is no Idea of these sensible things, as the Platonists
        said.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        669. But since there are two kinds of substance, the concrete whole and
        the intelligible structure of a thing (and I say that the former is
        substance taken as the intelligible structure conceived with matter, and
        the latter is the intelligible structure in general), then all things
        which are called substance in the former way are subject to corruption;
        for these are also subject to generation. But the intelligible structure
        is not subject to corruption in such a way that it perishes, since it is
        not subject to generation; for it is not the being of house that is
        produced, but the being of this house. But they both are and are not
        without generation and corruption; for it has been shown (611) that no
        one generates or produces these. And for this reason, too, there is
        neither definition nor demonstration of singular sensible substances,
        because they have matter whose nature is such that it is possible for
        them both to be and not to be; and for this reason all singular
        instances of these are corruptible. Now demonstration is of necessary
        things, and definition is scientific. And just as scientific knowledge
        cannot sometimes be scientific knowledge and sometimes ignorance, but
        what is such is opinion, so too neither can it be admitted that
        demonstration or definition is such (but it is opinion then which is
        concerned with something that can be otherwise than it is). But if this
        is true, it is evident that there will not be demonstration or
        definition of these things. For corruptible things are not evident to
        those having scientific knowledge; and when they have been removed from
        the sphere of sensory perception, even though their intelligible
        expressions remain the same in the mind, there will be neither
        demonstration nor definition of them. And for this reason when anyone,
        eager for setting the limits of things, defines one of these singulars,
        he must not ignore the fact that it is always possible to overthrow his
        definition; for it is not possible to define such a thing. Nor is it
        possible, then, to define any of the Ideas; for an Idea is of singular
        things (as they say), and is separable.
      </p>
      <p>
        670. And it is necessary that the intelligible expression of a thing
        should be composed of words; and one who forms a definition will not
        coin a word (for it would be unknown), but the attributes which are
        posited are common to all things. It is necessary, then, that these also
        apply to other things; for example, if anyone were to define you, he
        would say that you are an animal capable of walking or white or having
        some other attribute which is found in something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        671. But if anyone were to say that nothing prevents all things
        considered separately from being present in many things, but that taken
        together they are present together only in this one thing, it is first
        necessary to say that they belong to both; e.g., two-footed animal
        belongs both to animal and to two-footed. And this must be the case with
        eternal things.
      </p>
      <p>
        672. It is also necessary that they be prior existents and parts of the
        composite. And even more, they must be separable if man is separable;
        for either neither or both will be such. If, then, neither is separable,
        a genus will not exist apart from species; but if both are, so also will
        a difference be.
      </p>
      <p>
        673. Again, because they are prior to being itself, they will therefore
        not be destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        674. And, again, if the Ideas are composed of Ideas, less composite
        things are the elements of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        675. It will, moreover, be necessary that those things of which an Idea
        is composed should be predicated of many things, as animal and
        two-footed. But if this is not true, how will they be known? For there
        will be an Idea which cannot be predicated of more things than one.
        However, this does not seem to be the case, but every Idea is capable of
        being participated.
      </p>
      <p>
        676. Therefore, as was stated (671), the fact that it is impossible to
        give definitions of eternal things, and especially of any singular
        instances of these, as the sun and the moon, is hidden from these
        people. For people err by adding such attributes as can be removed and
        let the sun remain, for example, going around the earth or being hidden
        at night; (for according to them) if it stands still or is visible at
        night, it will no longer be the sun; but it is absurd if it is not so
        (for the sun means a certain substance); and they also err by adding
        attributes which are capable of belonging to something else; for
        example, supposing that another such thing should come into being, it
        would evidently be a sun. Therefore the definitive expression is common.
        But the sun was taken to be a singular thing, like Cleon and Socrates.
        For why do none of these thinkers offer any fixed limits of an Idea? For
        to those attempting this it would become evident that what has been said
        just now is true.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1606. In this place the Philosopher shows that the Ideas, which the
        Platonists claimed to be separate, are incapable of being defined. And
        he does this because the Platonists posited Ideas chiefly in order that
        they might apply them both to definitions and demonstrations, which have
        to do with what is necessary, since all these sensible substances seemed
        to be in motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to this he does two things. First (669:C 16o6), he uses
        arguments to show that the Ideas cannot be defined. Second (676:C 1627),
        he uses an example (“Therefore, as was stated”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first member of this division (669) he presents three arguments,
        and the first of these he states as follows: one kind of substance is
        “the intelligible structure,” i.e., the essence and form, and another is
        the composite of matter and form, which is the concrete whole made up of
        matter and form. And I say that these differ; i.e., “that the latter,”
        which is substance in the sense of the concrete whole, is substance
        taken as something having its intelligible structure conceived with
        matter; but the former, which is the form or intelligible structure or
        essence of a thing, is the intelligible structure or form in general,
        and this does not have individual matter connected with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        1607. Therefore all those things which are called substance in the sense
        of a composite are capable of being corrupted; for it was shown above
        (611:C 1423) that only those things which are composed of matter and
        form are subject to generation; and generation and corruption belong to
        the same subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        1608. And substance in the sense of the intelligible structure or
        whatness of a thing is incapable of being corrupted in such a way that
        it is corrupted in itself. For it was shown above (611:C 1417-23) that
        this kind of substance is not generated but only the composite; for it
        is not the essence of a house that is produced (as was shown above), but
        what is peculiar to this house; because it is this particular house and
        not the intelligible structure of a house that is produced. Yet forms
        and quiddities of this kind sometimes are and sometimes are not “without
        generation and corruption,” i.e., without being generated or corrupted
        in themselves, for they begin to be and not to be when other things are
        generated and corrupted. For it was shown above (611:C 1420) that in the
        case of natural things no one “generates these,” namely, their forms and
        quiddities; nor does this happen even in the case of artificial things;
        but this singular agent generates and produces this singular thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        1609. And because singular things are generated and corrupted there can
        be neither definition nor demonstration of singular sensible substances;
        for they contain individual matter whose nature is such that anything
        constituted of it is capable both of being and of not being. For matter
        itself, considered in itself, is in potentiality to form, by means of
        which the material thing exists, and to privation, by reason of which
        the material thing does not exist. Hence all singular things included
        among these sensible substances whose matter is in potentiality to being
        and non-bcing are corruptible. However, the celestial bodies do not have
        that kind of matter which is in potentiality to being and non-being, but
        that which is in potentiality to place; therefore they are not
        corruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
        1610. Hence, if demonstration is of necessary things, as was proved in
        the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>, and definition is also “scientific,”
        i.e., productive of science, because it serves as the middle term in a
        demonstration, which is a syllogism producing science, then just as it
        is impossible for scientific knowledge sometimes to be scientific
        knowledge and sometimes ignorance, because what is known scientifically
        must always be true, “but what is such,” i.e., what can sometimes be
        true and sometimes false, is opinion, in the same way it is impossible
        that there should be demonstration or definition of those things which
        can be otherwise than they are; but about contingent things of this kind
        there is only opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        1611. If this is so, I say, it is evident that there will be neither
        definition nor demonstration of these singular, sensible, corruptible
        things. For corruptible things of this kind cannot be clearly known by
        those who have scientific knowledge of them when they have passed
        outside the scope of the senses, through which they are known. Hence,
        “even though the intelligible expressions” or forms of these singular
        things, by which they can be known, “remain in the soul,” there will be
        neither definition nor demonstration of them. And for this reason when
        anyone, “eager for setting the limits of things,” i.e., the definition
        of anything, defines a singular thing, he must not ignore the fact that
        it is always possible to remove the singular while the intelligible
        expression as such which he forms in his mind remains. And this is true
        because it is impossible to give a genuine definition of a singular; for
        in the case of those things which are truly defined the knowledge of the
        thing defined remains as long as the knowledge of the definition remains
        in the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        1612. Therefore, if a singular thing cannot be defined, it is impossible
        to define an Idea; for an Idea must be a singular thing, according to
        those who posit Ideas, since they claim that an idea is something which
        subsists of itself apart from all other things; and this is what
        singular thing means.
      </p>
      <p>
        1613. <span style="font-weight: bold">And it is necessary</span> (670).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second argument; and in regard to this he does two
        things. First, he gives the argument; and second (671:C 1619), he
        rejects an answer which avoids the question (“But if”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now it was necessary that he should add this argument to the foregoing
        one, since the argument given has already proved that the singular is
        not definable because it is corruptible and material, and the Platonists
        did not assign these two properties to the Ideas. Hence, lest his proof
        should be rendered ineffective, he adds another argument (670), and
        states it as follows.
      </p>
      <p>
        1614. It is necessary that every definitive expression should be
        composed of several words; for one who defines a thing does not convey
        its meaning by giving only one word, because if he were to give only one
        the thing defined would still remain unknown to us. For when a single
        better known word is given it is possible to know the name of the thing
        defined but not the thing defined, unless its principles are given; for
        it is by its principles that everything becomes known.
      </p>
      <p>
        1615. Now the resolving of the thing defined into its principles—which
        those forming definitions intend to do—is possible only when several
        words are given. Therefore he says that, if only one word is given, the
        thing defined will still remain unknown; but if many words are given,
        they must be common to all things [of their class].
      </p>
      <p>
        1616. For if in the definition of any singular thing certain words are
        given which are proper only to that thing itself, they will be
        synonymous names of the same singular thing. Hence it is not the thing
        which will be made known when words of this kind are given, but perhaps
        a less well known word. For example, if we were to ask who Tullius is,
        and one were to answer, Marcus and Cicero, it would not be an apt
        definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        1617. Therefore, if a singular thing is defined, certain words must be
        given which are applicable to many things. Hence the definition must fit
        not only the singular thing whose definition is under investigation but
        also other things; and this is opposed to the notion of a true
        definition; for example, if someone intended to define you, and said
        that you are an animal capable of walking or a white animal or anything
        else that applies to you, this definition would not only fit you but
        other things as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        1618. It is evident, then, that a singular thing lacks a definition not
        only because it is corruptible and material but also because it is
        singular. Hence, neither is an Idea defined. The reason for this is the
        one which the Philosopher gives here: if the words taken to define a
        thing express the individual in terms of the things by which it is
        individuated, the words will be synonymous. But if they express the
        nature and common attributes without individuation, the definition will
        not be a proper definition of the thing defined, because all forms,
        accidental or substantial, which do not subsist of themselves, are, when
        considered in themselves, common to many. And if some are found in only
        one thing, as the form of the sun, this does not come from the form,
        inasmuch as it is of itself suited to be in many things, but from the
        matter; for the whole matter of the species is collected in one
        individual. Or this comes from its final cause, because one sun is
        sufficient for the perfection of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>1619. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if anyone</span> (671).</p>
      <p>
        Then he rejects an answer which is evasive. For someone could say that
        while any of those attributes given in the definition of a singular Idea
        are proper to many individually, yet taken together they are proper to
        only one thing, viz., to the one whose definition is under
        investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        He rejects this answer in two ways. First (671:C 1619), with reference
        to the Ideas themselves; and second (675:C 1624), with reference to
        those things of which they are the Ideas (“It will, moreover”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he rejects the answer
        mentioned above, showing that it still does not follow that the
        definition belongs only to the thing defined; and second (672:C 1620),
        that it does not belong to it primarily (“It is also necessary”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence he says (671) that in opposing this answer it must be said, first,
        that the definition assigned to any Idea also belongs to other Ideas;
        for example, if the definition of the Idea of man is two-footed animal,
        these two belong “to animal and to two-footed,” i.e., to the Idea of
        animal and to the Idea of two-footed; for those two Ideas combined would
        also be two-footed animal. Hence this definition, two-footed animal,
        will not be proper to the Idea of man. And this absurdity also
        follows,,in the case of eternal things,” i.e., if we consider the
        definition of an Idea, which is an eternal singular, from the
        Platonists’ point of view, and if we consider that the definition given
        to one Idea is proper to the others.
      </p>
      <p>1620. <span style="font-weight: bold">It is also</span> (672).</p>
      <p>
        Then he exposes the second consequence, namely, that the definition
        assigned to the Idea of rnan does not belong primarily to this Idea; and
        this is opposed to the notion of a definition, for a definition is shown
        to be true primarily of the thing defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        He proves this in three ways. First, he says that it is necessary not
        only that the definition given to man should belong to animal and to
        two-footed, but also that these—animal and two-footed—should be prior to
        man and be his parts inasmuch as man is composed of both.
      </p>
      <p>
        1621. But according to the position of the Platonists it would rather
        follow that both of these—animal and two-footed—are separable from man
        and from other animals, if man is assumed to be separable from
        individuals; because just as man is above individuals, in a similar
        fashion genus and difference are above man. For it is necessary either
        that nothing common be separable, or that both of these—animal and
        two-footed—be separable from man. Now if nothing common is separable, it
        follows that a genus will not exist apart from its species, and thus the
        genus will not signify substance. But if a genus exists apart from its
        species, then for a like reason a difference will also exist apart, for
        this is more common than a species. But if both animal and two-footed
        are separable from man, it follows that they are prior in the way in
        which the separate man is prior to the individual. And thus it further
        follows that the definition assigned to man belongs to certain prior
        things-to animal and to two-footed.
      </p>
      <p>1622. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, because</span> (673).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he proves the same point by means of another argument. He says
        that it is evident from the following consideration that animal and
        two-footed are prior to man in being; for those things are prior in
        being which are not destroyed when other things are destroyed, although
        when they are destroyed other things are destroyed. For example, the
        number one is prior to the number two because, when the number one is
        destroyed, the number two is destroyed; but not the reverse. And when
        animal and two-footed are destroyed, man is destroyed, although when man
        is destroyed the former—animal and two-footed—are not destroyed. Hence
        animal and two-footed are evidently prior to man.
      </p>
      <p>1623. <span style="font-weight: bold">And again</span> (674).</p>
      <p>
        He then proves the same point by a third argument. He says that the same
        conclusion is evident if we maintain not only that animal and two-footed
        are separable from man, as being Ideas of man, as was proved above in
        the first argument (671:C 1621), but also that man is composed of them,
        insomuch that in this way a separate Idea turns out to be composed of
        separate Ideas. For it is evident that animal and two-footed, of which
        man is composed, would be less composite than man, who is composed of
        them. But what is less composite is prior. Hence it follows again that
        animal and two-footed are prior to man, not only because they are
        separate, as the first argument advanced, but also because man is
        composite, as this third argument advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
        1624. <span style="font-weight: bold">It will, moreover</span> (675).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives an additional argument to reject the answer given above.
        He says that it not only follows that the definition assigned to the
        Idea of man is common to other prior Ideas, namely, to animal and to
        two-footed, of which the Idea of man is supposed to be composed, but
        also that these very things—animal and two-footed—will be predicated of
        many things and not just of man. And this will occur not only when they
        are taken in themselves, as the foregoing answer of these men stated,
        but also when they are taken together.
      </p>
      <p>
        1625. For if these elements of which the Idea of man is composed, animal
        and two-footed, are not predicated of many things, how is it known that
        they belong to the Idea of man, as was concluded above (644:C 1542-50)?
        For it would follow that there is some Idea which cannot be predicated
        of more things than one, since it is evident that the Idea of animal can
        be predicated of many individuals. Hence, if these two together—animal
        and two-footed—can be predicated of only one thing, it follows that
        two-footed restricts animal to one thing so that some Idea, two-footed,
        is predicated of only one thing. But this does not seem to be true,
        since every Idea is capable of being participated in by many things; for
        from one exemplar there arise many things which resemble that exemplar.
        Therefore the foregoing answer cannot be true.
      </p>
      <p>
        1626. Moreover, it must be understood that by the same argument it can
        also be adequately shown that no singular thing among these sensible
        things can be defined by any properties or united forms, whatever they
        may be. For any Idea, and also any form, taken in itself, is naturally
        disposed to exist in many things; and thus no matter how they may be
        combined there will be an exact definition of this singular thing only
        accidentally, inasmuch as it is possible for all of these forms taken
        together to be found in only one thing. It is obvious, then, that the
        principle of individuation is not a collection of accidents (as some
        said), but designated matter, as the Philosopher has stated (627:C
        1496).
      </p>
      <p>
        1627.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, as was stated</span> (676).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the third and chief argument to show that Ideas cannot be
        defined. He says that, since it has been stated above (669:C 1609) that
        individuals cannot be defined because of their corruptibility, as the
        first argument advanced, and since those attributes which are included
        in definitions are common ones, as the second argument advanced, the
        truth of the statement that it is impossible to define singulars among
        eternal things is not apparent, especially in the case of those which
        are unique in one species, as the sun and the moon. For since the things
        in question are eternal, the argument based on the corruptibility of
        singular things does not seem to be conclusive when applied to them. And
        because these things are unique in their species, the argument from the
        commonness of the parts of a definition does not seem to be conclusive
        in their regard; for in this case all attributes proper to one species
        alone are proper to one individual alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        1628. But those who think that these things are definable are deceived
        to such an extent that they make many errors in defining such things.
        They err in one respect inasmuch as they add in the definitions of these
        things such attributes as can be removed and let the things themselves
        remain, namely, the sun and the moon; for example, in defining the sun
        they say that it is something “going around the earth,” i.e., revolving
        around the earth, or “hidden at night,” i.e., invisible during the
        night. For if the sun were to stand still and not revolve around the
        earth, or if it appeared without being invisible at night, it would not
        be the sun if it had been defined properly. However, it would be absurd
        if it were not the sun when these attributes were removed, for the sun
        signifies a substance; but these things by which it is defined are
        certain of its accidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        1629. And they not only err in this way but also make a further mistake
        when they define the sun by an attribute which is suited to belong to
        something else; for supposing that “another such thing should come into
        being,” i.e., some body having such a form, or the same form and
        species, it is evident that it would be a sun, inasmuch as sun signifies
        a species; and in this way it can be defined. Hence, “the definitive
        expression is common,” i.e., the intelligible expression of the species
        sun. But this sun would be a singular thing like Cleon or Socrates. Thus
        it is certain that even though the Ideas are also claimed to be eternal
        and unique in their species, they still cannot be defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        1630. Hence none of those who posit Ideas reveal “any fixed limits,”
        i.e., definition, of an Idea. For if they were to give the definition of
        some Idea, as that of man or horse, it would become evident, in
        opposition to those attempting to define an Idea, that what has just
        been said is true: an Idea is indefinable.<br /></p

      <p>
        677. It is also evident that many of the things which are thought to be
        substances are potential, as the parts of animals; for none of them are
        separate. But when they have been separated, all are then like matter,
        for example, earth, fire and air; for none of them constitute a unity
        but they are like a heap of things before they are arranged and some one
        thing is produced from them. But someone might very easily suppose that
        the parts of living things and the parts of the soul which are close to
        them exist in actuality as well as in potency, because they have
        principles of motion consisting in something in their joints; and for
        this reason some animals live when they have been divided. Yet all parts
        exist potentially when they are one and continuous by nature, not by
        compulsion or by being joined together; for such a thing is a
        mutilation.
      </p>
      <p>
        678. And since the term one is used in the same senses as the term
        being, and the substance of unity is one, and those things whose
        substance is one are numerically one, it is evident that neither unity
        nor being can be the substance of things, as neither can the being of an
        element or a principle. But we look for the principle in order to reduce
        the thing to something better known. Therefore, among these unity and
        being are substance to a greater degree than principle, element or
        cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        679. But neither are these substance, if nothing that is common is
        substance; for substance is not present in anything else but itself and
        in that which has it, of which it is the substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        680. Furthermore, unity will not be present in many things at the same
        time; but what is common is present in many things at the same time.
        Hence it is evident that nothing universal exists apart from singular
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        681. But those who speak of the Forms are right in a sense when they
        make them separate, if they are substances; but in a sense they are
        wrong, because they say that a Form is one in many things. And the
        reason for this is that they cannot explain what are the incorruptible
        substances of this kind which exist apart from singular, sensible
        substances. Therefore they make them specifically the same as
        corruptible things (for we know these things); i.e., they invent a man
        himself and a horse itself by adding the word itself to sensible things.
        Hence, even if we did not see the stars, none the less, as I should
        presume, there would be eternal substances besides those which we see.
        Hence, even if we do not now know what they are, perhaps it is still
        necessary that there should be some. It is evident, then, that no
        universal predicates are substance, and that one substance is not
        composed of substances.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1631. Here the Philosopher clears up a point which remained a difficulty
        above, namely, how a substance is composed of parts, when he showed
        above (518:C 1318) that a substance could be composed neither of its
        accidental attributes nor of actually existing substances (657:C 1588).
        Therefore he shows here (677) that the parts of which substances are
        composed are not actually existing substances but potential ones. He
        says that, since it was stated above (565:C 1263) that there are some
        things which are thought by all to be substances, namely, sensible
        substances and their parts, it is evident that most substances of this
        kind are potential and not actual, as is clear of the parts of animals
        and all other parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        1632. He says that the parts of these substances are many, because since
        each whole is composed of many parts, there must be more component parts
        than composite wholes. And it is evident that parts exist potentially,
        because none of them are separate, but all parts as parts are rather
        united in the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        1633. For everything which is actual must be distinct from other things,
        because one thing is distinguished from another by its own actuality and
        form, as was stated above (658:C 1588). But when those things which are
        assumed to be parts have been separated from each other when the whole
        is dissolved, they are then actual beings, not as parts but as matter
        existing under the privation of the form of the whole. This is evident,
        for example, of earth, fire and air, which, when they are parts of a
        compound, are not actually existing things but exist potentially in the
        compound; but when they are separated, they are then actually existing
        things and not parts. For none of the elements “before they are
        arranged,” i.e., before they reach their proper state of mixture by way
        of alteration, and before one compound comes from them, together form a
        unity, except in the sense that a heap of stones is one in a qualified
        sense and not in an unqualified one. Or better “none of them,” i.e.,
        they do not constitute a unity before some one thing is produced from
        them by arrangement.
      </p>
      <p>
        1634. For even though all parts exist potentially, someone might very
        readily suppose that the parts of living things and those of the soul
        which are close to them are actual as well as potential, i.e., they are
        in potentiality close to actuality; and the reason is that living bodies
        are organic bodies having parts which are formally distinct. Hence they
        most of all are close to being actual; and this is because they have a
        principle of motion in some determinate part, since one part moves
        another. This is clear, for instance, in the case of their joints, in
        which the principle of motion of one of the two connected parts seems to
        be found, since one can be moved and another at rest, as is stated in
        <i>The Motion of Animals</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        1635. And since not only the parts of the body are in potentiality close
        to actuality, but also the parts of the soul, therefore some animals
        live after they have been divided, as segmented animals. And this is
        possible because in the whole animal there is one soul actually and
        there are many souls potentially. But when division is made the several
        souls become actual. This happens because of the imperfection of such
        animals which require very little diversity in their parts, for they
        have a soul with imperfect ability to function and incapable of acting
        in different ways, for which a number of different organs. are
        necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        1636. Yet even though these parts of the soul and the parts of living
        things are close to actuality, nevertheless they are all potential when
        the whole is one and continuous by nature. But this would not be the
        case if one thing came into being by force, as, for example, when the
        parts of one living thing are tied to those of another; or by grafting,
        as happens in the case of plants. For before the scion which is to be
        inserted is united with the plant, it is actual, but afterwards it is
        potential. “For such a thing,” namely, to be one by force or grafting,
        “is a mutilation,” i.e., something injurious to nature and opposed to
        nature.
      </p>
      <p>1637. <span style="font-weight: bold">And since</span> (678).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows in a special way that unity and being are not substances;
        and in regard to this he does two things. First, he states his thesis.
        He says that unity is predicated of things in the same way that being
        is, since they are interchangeable, and unity is predicated of a thing
        because of its substance. For one thing has one substance, and those
        things are numerically one whose substance is numerically one. And it is
        also evident that a thing is called a being because of its own
        substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1638. Since this is true, I say, it is clear that neither unity nor
        being can be the substance of things, but they are predicated rather of
        substance as their subject. And in a similar way neither does “the being
        of an element or a principle,” i.e., the very notion of a principle or
        element, express the substance of the thing called a principle or
        element. But we look for the principle or element in order to refer it
        to something better known, namely, to the substance of the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        1639. Yet being and unity are substance to a greater degree than a
        principle, element and cause, since they are closer to the substance of
        things; for principle, element and cause signify only the relationship
        of one thing to another, but being and unity signify something proper to
        a thing by reason of its own substance. Yet neither being nor unity is
        the substance itself of a thing.
      </p>
      <p>1640. <span style="font-weight: bold">But neither</span> (679).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he proves his thesis by two arguments. He gives the first of
        these when he says that since these—unity and being—are common
        attributes, they cannot be substances if nothing common is substance, as
        has been proved (655:C 1585). That nothing common is substance is clear
        from the fact that substance can only be present in the thing to which
        it belongs and of which it is the substance. Hence it is impossible that
        substance should be common to several things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1641. <span style="font-weight: bold">Furthermore, unity</span> (680).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument. He says that unity itself cannot be
        present in many things at the same time; for this is opposed to the
        notion of unity even though it is maintained that there is a unity which
        exists by itself as a substance. But what is common is present in many
        things at the same time, for common means what may be predicated of many
        things and be present in many things. Hence it is clear that a common
        unity cannot be one in the sense that it is one substance. Furthermore,
        it is evident from all the points already discussed above in this
        chapter that no universal—either being or unity or genera or species—has
        a separate being apart from singular things.
      </p>
      <p>1642. <span style="font-weight: bold">But those who</span> (681).</p>
      <p>
        He shows in what sense Plato’s statements are true, and in what sense
        they are not. He says that the Platonists, who assume that there are
        certain ideal forms, are right insofar as they claim that these are
        separate, because they hold that they are the substances of singular
        things; for by definition a substance is something that exists of
        itself. Now unity cannot be something that exists of itself if it exists
        in some singular thing, and the reason is that if it does exist in one
        singular thing it cannot exist in others; for, as has already been
        stated (680:C 1641), no self-subsistent unity can be present in many
        things. Hence considering Plato’s doctrine that the separate Forms are
        substance, he was right insofar as he maintained that they are separate.
      </p>
      <p>
        1643. But the Platonists were not right when they said that there is one
        form in many things; for these two statements seem to be opposed,
        namely, that something may be separate and exist of itself, and that it
        may still have being in many things. The reason why the Platonists were
        led to posit separate substances of this kind, yet have them existing in
        many things, is that they discovered through the use of reason that
        there must be some incorruptible and incorporeal substances, since the
        notion of substance is not bound up with corporeal dimensions. But “they
        cannot explain” which substances are of this kind which are
        incorruptible and exist apart from these singular and sensible
        substances, i.e., they cannot describe and make them known, because our
        knowledge begins from the senses and therefore we can ascend to
        incorporeal things, which transcend the senses, only insofar as we may
        be guided by sensible substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        1644. Therefore in order that they might convey some knowledge of
        incorporeal, incorruptible substances, “they make,” i.e., they suppose,
        them to be specifically the same as corruptible substances, just as they
        find among these corruptible substances a singular corruptible man and
        similarly a singular corruptible horse. Hence they claimed that among
        those separate substances there is a substance which is man, and another
        which is horse, and so on for other things, but in a different way;
        because according to the doctrine of the Platonists we know these
        separate substances on the grounds that we speak of “man himself,” i.e.,
        man-in-himself, “and horse itself,” i.e., horse-in-itself. And thus in
        order to designate separate substances “we add this word,” i.e., the
        term “itself,” or in itself, to each sensible substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1645. From this it appears that the Platonists wanted those separate
        substances to be specifically the same as these sensible substances; and
        to differ only in that they gave to separate substances the name of a
        form in itself, but not to sensible substances. The reason for this is
        that singular substances contain many things which are not parts of the
        form, and they said that separate substances contain only those elements
        which pertain to the specific form and to the nature of the specific
        form. Hence this separate man was called man-in-himself, because he
        contained only those elements which pertain to the nature of the form;
        but this singular man contains many other things besides those which
        pertain to the form, and for this reason he is not called
        man-in-himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        1646. Now there is a defect in this position comparable to that of
        maintaining that we do not see the stars and other incorruptible bodies
        but that it was nevertheless certain by reason that there existed
        incorruptible bodies, and then maintaining that incorruptible bodies
        were specifically the same as the bodies of corruptible things; as if we
        were to say that ox and man and horse and other substances of this kind
        were incorruptible bodies, as the poets imagined a ram (Aries) and a
        bull (Taurus) and the like to be present in the stars. Therefore even if
        we did not see the stars, none the less, “as I should presume,” there
        would be “eternal corporeal substances,” i.e., the stars, in addition to
        those substances which we did then see, namely, corruptible bodies of
        this kind, and they would be of a different species than these. And in a
        similar way, even if we do not now know how to express what separate
        substances are and of what nature they are, perhaps it is still
        necessary that there should be some separate substances in addition to
        sensible ones, and of a different species than these. And he says
        “Perhaps” because he has not yet proved that there are any separate
        substances apart from matter. However, he will prove this in later books
        (XII & XIII).
      </p>
      <p>
        1647. Last of all he draws the conclusion at which he aims throughout
        the whole chapter. He says that two things are evident from what has
        been said: first, that no universal predicates are substances; and
        second, that no substance consists of substances having actual
        existence, or according to another text, “one substance is not composed
        of substances.” For he has shown above (655:C 1584-5) that substance in
        the sense of this particular thing does not consist of common attributes
        which signify of what sort a thing is.<br /></p

      <p>
        682. But let us state both what and what kind of thing it is necessary
        to say substance is, as though we were making a fresh start; for perhaps
        from these things we shall come to an understanding of that kind of
        substance which is separate from sensible substances. Hence, since
        substance is a principle and cause, let us proceed from this starting
        point.
      </p>
      <p>
        683. Now the why of a thing is always investigated in the following way:
        why does one thing belong to something else? For to ask why a musical
        man is a musical man, is either to ask (as has been said) why the man is
        musical, or to ask about something else. Therefore to ask why a thing is
        itself is to make no inquiry at all; for both the fact that a thing is
        such and its existence must be evident from the first; and I mean, for
        example, that the moon undergoes an eclipse. And in the case of all
        things there is one reason and one cause of the fact that a thing is
        itself, for example, why a man is a man, or why the musical is
        musical—unless one were to say that each thing is indivisible in
        relation to itself. But this is what being one really is. However, this
        is common to all things and is small. But someone might ask, “Why is man
        such and such an animal?” This, then, is evident, that he is not asking
        why he who is a man is a man. Therefore one is asking why something is
        predicated of something else; for if this were not so, the inquiry would
        be about nothing, for example, “Why does it thunder?” The answer is,
        “because sound is produced in the clouds.” For what is being
        investigated is one thing as predicated in this way of something else.
        And “Why are these things,” for example, bricks and stones, “a house?”
        It is evident, then, that he is asking about the cause. And this—to
        speak logically—is the quiddity. Now in the case of some things this is
        that for the sake of which a thing exists [its end or goal], as, say, in
        the case of a house or a bed. But in the case of other things it is the
        thing which first moves them, for this also is a cause. Such a cause is
        sought in the process of generation and corruption, while the other is
        also sought in the case of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        684. Now the object of our inquiry is most obscure in cases concerned
        with things not predicated of others, as when we ask what man is;
        because a single term is used and it is not said definitely that he is
        this or that.
      </p>
      <p>
        685. But in dealing with this question corrections must be; for if this
        is not done, it will turn out that asking something and asking nothing
        will have something in common. But since it is necessary to assume that
        the thing exists, it is clear that the question is why the matter is
        such and such, for example, why are these materials a house? Because
        these are the ones that constitute the being of a house. And why is this
        individual a man? or why is a thing having such and such a body a man?
        Hence what is being sought is the cause of the matter, and this is the
        specifying principle by reason of which something exists; and this is
        substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        686. Hence it is evident that there is no inquiry or teaching as regards
        simple things, but that there is a different method of investigating
        such things.
      </p>
      <p>
        687. Now since what is composed is composed of something in such a way
        that the whole is one, though not as a heap of things, but as a syllable
        is, a syllable is not the same as its letters i.e., <i>ba</i> is not the
        same as the letters <i>b</i> and <i>a</i>; nor is flesh the same as
        fire; for when these are dissociated, they no longer exist, for example,
        flesh and the like; but the elements exist, and fire and earth exist.
        Hence a syllable is a determinate thing, and not merely the elements of
        speech, as the vowel and the consonant, but something else as well. And
        flesh is not merely fire and earth, or the hot and the cold, but
        something else as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        688. Therefore, if something must either be an element or composed of
        elements, then if it is an element the same argument will again apply;
        for flesh will consist of this and fire and earth and something else
        besides, so that there will be an infinite regress. But if it is
        composed of elements, it is evident that it is not composed of one
        (otherwise it would be that very thing itself), but of many. Hence we
        use the same argument in this case as we did in that of a syllable or of
        flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        689. Now it would seem that this something else exists, and that it is
        an element and the cause of being, i.e., that it is the cause of this
        being flesh and of this being a syllable; and it is similar in other
        cases. But this element is the substance of each thing and the first
        cause of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        690. And since certain things are not substances, although all those
        which are according to nature and are constituted such by nature are
        substances, it is evident that in some cases this substance is a nature
        which is not an element but a principle. Now an element is something
        into which a thing is divided and which is intrinsic as matter; for
        example, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the elements of a syllable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1648. At the beginning of this seventh book the Philosopher had promised
        that he would treat of the substance of sensible things in the sense of
        their essence, which he has explained from the viewpoint of logic by
        showing that those attributes which are predicated essentially pertain
        to the whatness of a thing, since it was not yet evident what it is that
        constitutes substance in the sense of essence. Now the Platonists said
        that this substance is the universals, which are separate Forms. But
        this doctrine Aristotle rejected immediately above. Hence it remained
        for him to show what substance in the sense of essence really is. And in
        order to do this he also sets down as a premise that substance in the
        sense of essence has the character of a principle and cause. nis is the
        purpose of this chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence it is divided into two parts. In the first (691:C 1648) he
        explains what his aim is. In the second (683:C 1649) he proceeds to
        carry out his aim (“Now the why”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (682), that, since it has been shown that no
        universal predicate is a substance, as the Platonists claimed, let us
        state what the real truth of the matter is about substance, viz., that
        which is essence, “and what kind of thing” this substance is, i.e.,
        whether it is form or matter or something of this kind. He says “Let us
        state this,” as if we were introducing or announcing a starting point
        different from the dialectical one with which we began in the beginning
        of this seventh book to investigate the above-mentioned substance; for
        perhaps from the things which are to be said about the quiddities of
        sensible substances it will also be possible to understand that kind of
        substance which is separate from sensible substances. For even though
        separate substances are not of the same species as sensible ones, as the
        Platonists claimed, still a knowledge of these sensible substances is
        the road by which we reach a knowledge of those separate substances. And
        he adds what that other starting point is from which one must enter upon
        the proposed investigation. He says that one must proceed from this
        starting point in order to show what the above-mentioned kind of
        substance is, so that we may understand that in substance itself there
        is a principle and cause.
      </p>
      <p>1649. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now the why</span> (683).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that substance in the sense of essence is a principle and
        cause; and in regard to this he does two things. ‘ First (683), he shows
        that it is a principle and cause. Second (687:C 1672), he shows what
        kind of principle it is (“Now since what”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he explains his aim.
        Second (684:C 1662), he rejects an interpretation which could seem
        opposed to the argument he has given (“Now the object”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the point of his argument is as follows: whatever is such that one
        does not ask why it is, but is that to which the other things under
        investigation are reduced, must be a principle and cause; for the
        question why is a question about a cause. But substance in the sense of
        essence is a thing of this kind; for one does not ask why man is man,
        but why man is something else; and it is the same in other cases.
        Therefore the substance of a thing in the sense of its essence is a
        principle and cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        1650. Hence he says, first (683), that “the why of a thing is always
        investigated in the following way,” i.e., we use the question why when
        we ask why one thing belongs to something else, and not why a thing is
        itself. “For to ask why a musical man is a musical man is either to ask
        (as has been said) why the man is musical, or to ask about something
        else.” This is equivalent to saying that, when we ask why a musical man
        is a musical man, this question can be interpreted in two ways: first,
        that the thing which has been stated and posited is under investigation,
        i.e., the thing being investigated, namely, the whole, musical man, is
        asked about the whole, musical man. Second, that one thing is asked
        about another; i.e., about a man who is musical what is asked is not why
        he is a man, but why he is musical.
      </p>
      <p>
        1651. And he immediately rejects the first interpretation, saying that
        to ask why a thing is itself, for example, why man is man, is to make no
        inquiry at all; for every time we ask the question why, there must be
        something which is evident, and something which is not evident and has
        to be investigated. For there are four questions which may be asked, as
        is stated in Book 11 of the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>, namely, (i) “Is
        it?” (2.) “What is it?” (3) “Is it a fact that it is such?” and (4) “Why
        is it such?” Now two of these questions, namely, “What is it?” and “Why
        is it such?” basically coincide, as is proved in that work. And just as
        the question “What is it?” is related to the question “Is it?” so too
        the question “Why is it such?” is related to the question “Is it a fact
        that it is such?” Hence, when one asks the question why, these two
        points must be evident; for inasmuch as the question “Why is it such?”
        bears on the same point as the question “What is it?” the fact of the
        thing’s existence must be evident. And inasmuch as the question “Why is
        it such?” is distinguished from the question “What is it?” the fact that
        it is such must be evident. Hence he says that, when one asks why, these
        two things must be evident, namely, the fact that it is such, and its
        existence, which pertains to the question “Is it?” for example, when we
        ask, “Why does the moon undergo an eclipse?” it must be evident that the
        moon does undergo an eclipse; for if this were not evident, it would be
        pointless to inquire why this is so. And by the same reasoning, when one
        asks “What is man?” it must be evident that man exists. But this could
        not happen if one were to ask why a thing is itself, for example, “Why
        is man man?” or “Why is the musical musical?” for in knowing that a man
        is a man it is known why he is a man.
      </p>
      <p>
        1652. For in the case of all things there is one reason and one cause
        which cannot remain unknown, just as other common notions, which are
        called the common conceptions of the intellect, cannot remain unknown.
        And the reason is that each is one with itself. Hence each is predicated
        of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        1653. Now it might be that someone should want to give another cause,
        saying that the reason a man is a man, and the musical is musical, and
        so on in other cases, is that each is indivisible in relation to itself;
        and thus it cannot be denied of itself so that we should say that a man
        is not a man. Hence it must be affirmed of itself. But this argument
        does not differ from the first which we gave, namely, that each thing is
        one with itself. For “this is what being one really is”; i.e., we
        maintained above that unity signifies indivisibility. Therefore it is
        the same thing to say that each thing is one with itself and that it is
        indivisible in relation to itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        1654. But even supposing that this argument differed from the preceding
        one, this too is still a characteristic common to all things, namely,
        that each thing is indivisible in relation to itself “and is something
        small,” i.e., it has the nature of a principle, which is small in size
        and great in power. Hence one cannot inquire about it as about something
        unknown, any more than about other common principles. Another
        translation reads “And it is like a tone,” as if to say that it is in
        harmony with the truth in all things. But another text has “And it is
        true,” and we must understand by this “self-evident.” Thus it is obvious
        that there can be no investigation as to why a thing is itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        1655. It follows, then, that one always asks why this thing is something
        else. Hence he makes this clear next. He says that, if someone might ask
        “Why is man such and such an animal?” it is evident that he is not
        asking why man is man. Thus it is clear that he is asking why one thing
        is predicated of something else, and not why the same thing is
        predicated of itself. But when someone asks why something is predicated
        of something else, the fact that it exists must be evident; “for if this
        were not so,” i.e., if it were not evident that it existed, “the inquiry
        would be about nothing”; for one is possibly inquiring about what is
        not. Or it may be taken in another way as referring to the point
        mentioned before; “for if this were not so,” i.e., if one did not
        inquire about one thing as predicated of something else but as
        predicated of itself, the inquiry would be about nothing, as has been
        shown.
      </p>
      <p>
        1656. Now in asking the why of something, sometimes we are asking about
        the cause taken as form in matter. Hence when we ask “Why does it
        thunder?” the answer is, “because sound is produced in the clouds”; for
        here it is clear that what is being asked is one thing of another, for
        sound is in the clouds, or thunder in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        1657. But sometimes we are asking about the cause of the form in the
        matter, either the efficient cause or final cause; for when we ask “Why
        are these materials (bricks and stones) a house?” the question concerns
        one thing as predicated of something else, namely, bricks and stones of
        a house. Hence the Philosopher did not say without qualification that
        the question is “What is a house?” but “Why are things of this kind a
        house?” It is evident, then, that this question asks about a cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        1658. Now the cause which he has been investigating is the essence,
        logically speaking; for the logician considers the way in which terms
        are predicated and not the existence of a thing. Hence he says that
        whatever answer is given to the question “What is this thing?” pertains
        to the quiddity, whether it is intrinsic, as matter and form, or
        extrinsic, as the agent and final cause. But the philosopher, who
        inquires about the existence of things and their final and efficient
        cause, does not include them under the quiddity since they are
        extrinsic. If we say, then, that a house is something which protects us
        from cold and heat, the quiddity is signified from the viewpoint of
        logic, but not from that of the philosopher. Hence he says that the
        thing which is being investigated as the cause of the form in the matter
        is the quiddity, logically speaking. Yet according to the truth of the
        matter and from the point of view of natural philosophy, in the case of
        some things (for example, a house and a bed) this cause is “that for the
        sake of which a thing exists,” i.e., its goal [or end].
      </p>
      <p>
        1659. He draws examples from the sphere of artificial things because it
        is most evident that these exist for the sake of some goal; for even
        though natural things also exist for some goal, this was nevertheless
        denied by some thinkers. Therefore, when someone asks why stones and
        timbers are a house, one can answer by stating the final cause: to
        shelter ourselves from cold and heat. But in certain cases the thing
        under investigation, as the cause of the form in the matter, “is that
        which first moves a thing,” i.e., the agent; for this also is a cause,
        for example, if we ask “Why are stones and timbers a house?” one can
        answer, “because of the art of building.”
      </p>
      <p>
        1660. Yet there is this difference between the efficient and the final
        cause: such a cause (the efficient) is investigated as the cause of the
        process of generation and corruption. But the other cause (the final) is
        investigated not merely as the cause, of the process of generation and
        corruption but also of being. The reason for this is that the agent
        causes the form in the matter by changing the matter over to that form,
        as takes places in the process of generation and corruption. And
        inasmuch as the goal moves the agent through his intending it, it is
        also a cause of generation and corruption. And inasmuch as the thing is
        directed to its goal by means of its form, it is also a cause of being.
        Hence, when it is said that stones and timbers are a house as a result
        of the art of building, it is understood that the art of building is the
        cause of the production of the house. But when it is said that stones
        and timbers are a house in order to shelter us from cold and heat, it
        can be understood that the house has been built for this reason, and
        that it is useful for this reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        1661. Now the Philosopher is speaking here of natural substances. Hence
        his statement here must be understood to apply only to a natural agent,
        which acts by means of motion. For the Divine agent, who communicates
        being without motion, is the cause not only of becoming but also of
        being.
      </p>
      <p>1662. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now the object</span> (684).</p>
      <p>
        Since he had said above that when one asks why, one always inquires
        about something as predicated of something else, and this seems in a way
        to give rise to a problem, therefore in this Place he raises the problem
        about this point and solves it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now in regard to this he does three things. First, he raises the
        problem. Second (685:C 1664), he solves it (“But in dealing”). Third
        (686:C 1669), he draws a corollary from his discussion (“Hence it is
        evident”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (684), that “the object of our inquiry,”
        i.e., what is investigated in Any inquiry pertaining to one thing as
        predicated of something else, “is most obscure,” or puzzling, “in cases
        concerned with things not predicated of others,” i.e., where the inquiry
        is about something not predicated of something else but is about a
        single thing; for when one inquires “What is man?” this, I say, is
        obscure “because a single term is used,” but it is “not said definitely
        that he is this or that”; i.e., the cause of the difficulty is that in
        such cases one single thing is expressed, as man, and in that inquiry
        the things to which it belongs to be a man as parts, or also the
        particular supposit, are not expressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        1663. But this difficulty does not seem to have anything to do with the
        point at issue; for the Philosopher spoke above about the question “Why
        is a thing such?” and not “What is it?” and this difficulty has to do
        with the question “What is it?” But it must be said that the questions
        “What is it?” and “Why is it?” bear on the same point, as has been
        stated (C 1651). Hence the question “What is it?” can be changed into
        the question “Why is it such?” for the question “What is it?” asks about
        the quiddity by reason of which that thing about which one asks this
        question, is predicated of any of its own subjects and is proper to its
        own parts; for Socrates is a man because the answer to the question
        “What is man?” is pertinent to him. And for this reason flesh and bones
        are man, because the whatness of man is contained in these flesh and
        bones. Therefore it is the same thing to ask “What is man?” and, “Why is
        this (Socrates) a man?” or “Why are these things (flesh and bones) a
        man?” And this is the same as the question which was raised above “Why
        are stones and timbers a house?” Therefore he also says here that this
        causes a difficulty, because in this investigation this and that are not
        added; for if they were added it would be evident that the answer to the
        question which asks about the quiddity of man and to the other questions
        of which he spoke above would be the same.
      </p>
      <p>1664. <span style="font-weight: bold">But in dealing</span> (685).</p>
      <p>
        He now solves the foregoing problem. He says that in order to dispose of
        the problem relating, to the foregoing question “corrections must be
        made,” i.e., it is necessary to correct the question given, so that in
        place of the question “What is man?” we will substitute the question
        “Why is Socrates a man?” or “Why are flesh and bones a man?” And if this
        question is not corrected, the absurd consequence will be that asking
        something and asking nothing will have something in common. For it was
        said above that to ask something about a thing in terms of itself is not
        to make any inquiry at all; but to ask something about something else is
        to ask about something. Therefore, since the question why (in which we
        ask something about something else) and the question what (in which we
        do not seem to ask something about something else) have something in
        common, unless they are corrected in the way mentioned above, it follows
        that a question asking nothing and a question asking something have
        something in common.
      </p>
      <p>
        1665. Or to state it in another way—if this question is not corrected,
        it follows that those cases in which no question at all is asked and
        those in which a question is asked have something in common. For when a
        question is asked about that which is, something is asked, but when a
        question is asked about that which is not, nothing is asked. Hence, if
        in asking what a thing is we need not assume anything and ask anything
        else of it, this question applies both to being and to non-being. Thus
        the question “What is it?” would apply in common both to something and
        to nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        1666. But since in the question “What is man?” it is necessary to know
        the truth of the fact that man exists (otherwise there would be no
        question), as when we ask why there is an eclipse, we must know that an
        eclipse exists, it is evident that one who asks what man is, asks why he
        is. For in order that one may ask what a thing is, the existence of the
        thing has to be presupposed, because it is assumed by the question why.
        Thus, when we ask “What is a house?” it would be the same as asking “Why
        are these materials (stones and timbers) a house?” because of these,
        i.e., “because the parts of a house constitute the being of a house,”
        i.e., the quiddity of a house is present in the parts of a house.
      </p>
      <p>
        1667. For it was said above that in such cases the question why
        sometimes asks about the form and sometimes about the agent and
        sometimes about the goal of a thing. And similarly when we ask what man
        is, it is the same as asking “Why is this (Socrates) a man?” because the
        quiddity of man belongs to him. Or it would also be the same as asking
        “Why is a body, which is disposed in this way (organically) a man?” For
        this is the matter of man, as stones and bricks are the matter of a
        house.
      </p>
      <p>
        1668. Hence in such questions it is evident that we are asking about
        “the cause of the matter,” i.e., why it is made to be of this nature.
        Now the thing under investigation which is the cause of the matter is
        “the specifying principle,” namely, the form by which something is. And
        this “is the substance,” i.e., the very substance in the sense of the
        quiddity. Thus it follows that his thesis has been proved, i.e., that
        substance is a principle and cause.
      </p>
      <p>1669. <span style="font-weight: bold">Hence it is</span> (686).</p>
      <p>
        He then draws a corollary from his discussions. He says that, since in
        all questions one asks about something as predicated of something else,
        as the cause of the matter, which is the formal cause, or the cause of
        the form in matter, as the final cause and the agent, it is evident that
        there is no inquiry about simple substances, which are not composed of
        matter and form. For, as has been stated, in every inquiry there must be
        something which is known and some investigation about something which we
        do not know. Now such substances are either totally known or totally
        unknown, as is stated in Book IX (810:C 1905). Hence there is no inquiry
        about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        1670. And for this reason there also cannot be any teaching concerning
        them, as there is in the speculative sciences. For teaching produces
        science, and science arises in us by our knowing why a thing is; for the
        middle term of a demonstrative syllogism, which causes science, is why a
        thing is so.
      </p>
      <p>
        1671. But lest the study of such substances should seem to be foreign to
        the philosophy of nature, he therefore adds that the method of
        investigating such things is different; for we come to an understanding
        of these substances only from sensible substances, of which these simple
        substances are, in a measure, the cause. Therefore we make use of
        sensible substances as known, and by means of them we investigate simple
        substances, just as the Philosopher investigates below (Book XII) the
        immaterial substances, which cause motion, by means of motion. Hence in
        our teaching and investigations of them we use effects as the middle
        term in our investigations of simple substances whose quiddities we do
        not know. And it is also evident that simple substances are related to
        sensible ones in the process of teaching as the form and other causes
        are related to matter; for just as we inquire about the form of sensible
        substances and about their goal and their efficient causes as the causes
        of matter, in a similar fashion we inquire about simple substances as
        the causes of material substances.
      </p>
      <p>1672. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now since what</span> (687).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows what kind of cause and principle substance is when taken
        as the quiddity of a thing; and in regard to this he does three things.
        First, he premises a certain distinction necessary for the proof of his
        thesis. Second (688:C 1675), he raises a difficulty (“Therefore, if
        something”). Third (689:C 1678), he solves it (“Now it would seem”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first (687) he distinguishes one kind of composition
        from several others; for sometimes composition involves many things in
        such a way that the whole is one thing composed of many, as a house is
        composed of its parts and a compound is composed of elements. But
        sometimes a composite results from many things in such a way that the
        whole composite is not one thing in an unqualified sense but only in a
        qualified one, as is clear of a heap or pile of stones when the parts
        are actual, not being continuous. Hence it is many in an unqualified
        sense, but is one only in a qualified sense, inasmuch as many things are
        grouped together in place.
      </p>
      <p>
        1673. Now it is characteristic of the notion of this kind of diversity
        that the composite sometimes derives its species from some one thing,
        which is either the form (as in a compound) or combination (as in a
        house) or arrangement (as in a syllable or in a number). And then the
        whole composite must be one without qualification. But sometimes the
        composite derives its species from the very multitude of collected
        parts, as in a heap of things and a group of people and so forth; and in
        such cases the whole composite is not a unity in an unqualified sense
        but only with qualification.
      </p>
      <p>
        1674. Hence the Philosopher says that, since one kind of composite is
        constituted of something in this way “as a whole”—i.e., the whole is
        one—and not in the way in which a heap of stones is one but as a
        syllable is one (without qualification), in all such cases the composite
        must not be identical with its components, as a syllable is not its
        letters; for this syllable <i>ba</i> is not the same as these two
        letters <i>b</i> and <i>a</i>, nor is flesh the same as fire and earth.
        He proves this as follows. “When these are dissociated,” i.e., when the
        things of which the composite is made up are separated from each other,
        “this”—the whole—does not remain after its dissolution. For when the
        elements have been actually separated, flesh does not remain; and when
        its letters have been separated, the syllable does not remain. “But the
        elements,” i.e., the letters, remain after the dissolution of the
        syllable, and fire and earth remain after the dissolution of flesh.
        Therefore the syllable is something over and above its elements, and it
        is not only its elements, which are vowels and consonants, but there is
        also something else by which a syllable is a syllable. And in a similar
        way flesh is not merely fire and earth, or the hot and the cold, by
        whose power the elements are mixed, but there is also something else by
        which flesh is flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        1675.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, if something</span> (688).
      </p>
      <p>
        He raises a problem relating to his principal thesis; for it was shown
        that there is something else in flesh and in a syllable besides their
        elements; for it seems that everything which is, is either an element or
        composed of elements. If, then, it is necessary that this additional
        something which is present in flesh and in a syllable over and above
        their elements should be either an element or composed of elements, this
        absurdity results.
      </p>
      <p>
        1676. For if this is an element, the same argument will apply again both
        to this and to other elements, because it will have to be numbered with
        the others. For flesh will be composed both of this thing, which we said
        was something over and above the elements, and which we now claim to be
        an element, and of fire and earth. And since it has already been proved
        that in every composite which is one there must be something in addition
        to its elements, the same question will then apply to this something
        else, because, if it is an element, flesh will again be composed both of
        the other original element, and of the elements, and then of something
        else. Hence in this way there will be an infinite regress; but this is
        absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
        1677. Therefore, if this something else when found is not an element but
        is composed of elements, it is evident that it is not composed of one
        element only but of many; because if it were not composed of many but of
        only one, it would follow that that element
      </p>
      <p>
        would be the same as the whole; for what is composed of water only is
        truly water. Hence, if it is composed of many elements, the same
        argument will again apply to this thing as applies to flesh and a
        syllable, because it will contain something else besides the elements of
        which it is composed. And the same question will again apply to this.
        Thus once more there will be an infinite regress.
      </p>
      <p>
        1678. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now it would seem</span> (689).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he solves the problem which he raised; and in regard to this he
        does two things. First, he solves it with reference to the way in which
        it first appears. Second (690:C 1679), he corrects this solution and
        gives the true one (“And since some”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says, first (689), that the thing which is present in
        composites over and above their elements would seem at first glance not
        to be something composed of elements, but to be an element and cause of
        the being of flesh and a syllable and similarly of other things.
        Moreover, it would seem that it is the substance of each of them in the
        sense of their quiddity; for substance in the sense of quiddity is the
        first cause of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        1679.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">And since certain things</span> (690).
      </p>
      <p>
        He now corrects the above solution in two ways: first, insofar as he had
        said that this something else which is present in composite things over
        and above their elements is the substance of each; for this is true of
        things which are substances, but not of things which are not substances,
        since the form of a syllable is not a substance; second, insofar as he
        had said that this very thing is an element and a cause of being; for it
        cannot be called an element but a principle, because elements pertain to
        the material cause of a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        1680. Therefore he says that, since some things are not substances, as
        is c1car especially of artificial things, but just those are true
        substances that are “according to nature,” with reference to being, “and
        are constituted such by nature,” with reference to becoming, it will be
        made clear that this nature which we are investigating is substance “in
        some cases,” i.e., in that of natural beings, and not in all. And it
        will also be made clear that this nature is not an element but a formal
        principle; for that is called an element into which something is divided
        and which is “intrinsic” as matter; for example, the elements of the
        syllable <i>ba</i> are <i>b</i> and <i>a</i>. Hence, since the principle
        in question is not a material principle but a formal one, it will not be
        an element. And thus it is evident at the same time both what kind of
        principle substance is, and that it is neither an element nor composed
        of elements. The foregoing problem is solved in this way.
