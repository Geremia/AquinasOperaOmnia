    <p>
      Philosophy of nature is in a way the most important course in Philosophy.
      Metaphysics and philosophy of the nature of man are more important because
      what they treat, but these sciences are grounded in Philosophy of Nature,
      and without a good Philosophy of Nature there can be no sound metaphysics
      or philosophy of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I share the conviction of many that Thomas Aquinas' philosophy is
      essential for any sound philosophy of nature. Yet it cannot be denied that
      the chemistry and physics he inherited and accepted is flawed in many
      important points, and these affect his fundamental philosophy of nature,
      since for him physics, chemistry and biology formed an integral whole with
      the basic principles studied in the <i>Physics</i>. His geocentric
      universe is a small problem in comparison with his lack of appreciation of
      the full implications of the idea of impetus.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also many erroneous ideas circulating in introductions to modern
      texbooks on the physical sciences. These and other problems are faced in
      this book, to the extent that is possible in an introductory work such as
      this. Some of the passages of modern authors have been taken from Vincent
      E. Smith
    </p>
    <p><strong>Plan of the course</strong></p>
    <p>
      Following Aristotle's <em>Physics</em> and Thomas' Commentary, we have the
      following tasks to do:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To determine what is Philosophy of Nature in the scheme of philosophy
        and science.
      </li>
      <li>
        To determine the fundamental principles of nature, with an examination
        of the different meanings of nature.
      </li>
      <li>To define the subject of natural science.</li>
      <li>
        To examine causality and chance, because natural causes are the
        principles of demonstration.
      </li>
      <li>
        To analyze the meaning of motion and its various species, since motion
        is the basic characteristic of natural things.
      </li>
      <li>To analyze several subsidiary concepts, such as the infinite,</li>
      <li>place, space, void,</li>
      <li>time.</li>
      <li>
        To analyze further the three species of motion, replying to various
        objections to the possibility of motion.
      </li>
      <li>
        To analyze the divisibility of motion and rest, towards determining the
        efficient cause.
      </li>
      <li>
        To determine the what is the first mover or ultimate efficient cause of
        motion, and
      </li>
      <li>To review all the various arguments for the existence of God.</li>
    </ol>
