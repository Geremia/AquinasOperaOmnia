    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It seems that it belongs only to His knowledge, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Boethius says, “It is certainly clear that Providence is the immovable
    and simple form of things to be done.” Now, in God the form of things that
    should be done is an idea, and an idea pertains to His knowledge.
    Providence, therefore, pertains to His knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. But it was said that providence also pertains to God’s will in so far as
    it is the cause of things.—To the contrary, in us practical knowledge causes
    the things that we know. Practical knowledge, however, consists merely in
    knowledge. The same is true, therefore, of providence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. In the same section as cited above, Boethius writes: “The plan of
    carrying things out, when considered in the purity of God’s understanding,
    is called Providence.” Now, purity of understanding seems to pertain to
    speculative knowledge. Providence, therefore, pertains to speculative
    knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Boethius writes: “Providence is so called because, standing at a distance
    from the lowest things, it looks upon all things from their highest summit.”
    Now, to look upon is to know, especially to know speculatively. Providence,
    therefore, seems to belong to speculative knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. As Boethius says: “Fate is related to Providence as reasoning is to
    understanding.” Now, understanding and reasoning are common to both
    speculative and practical knowledge. Providence, therefore, also belongs to
    both types of knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. Augustine writes: “An unchangeable law controls all changeable things,
    governing them gloriously.” Now, control and government belong to
    providence. Consequently, that unchangeable law is providence itself. But
    law pertains t knowledge. Therefore, providence also belongs to knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. The natural law as it exists wi in us is caused by divine providence.
    Now, a cause acts to bring about an effect in its own likeness. For this
    reason we also say that God’s goodness is the cause of goodness in things,
    His essence, the cause of their being, and His life, the cause of their
    living. Divine providence, therefore, is a law; hence, our former position
    stands.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. Boethius says: “Providence is the divine plan set up within the ruler of
    all things.” Now, as Augustine says,” the divine plan of a thing is an idea.
    Providence, therefore, is an idea; and since an idea pertains to knowledge,
    providence also pertains to knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. Practical knowledge is ordained either to bring things into existence or
    to order things already in existence. Now, it does not belong to providence
    to bring things into existence. It rather presupposes the things over which
    it is exercised. Nor does it order things that are in existence. This
    belongs to God’s disposal of things. Providence, therefore, pertains not to
    practical, but only to speculative knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Providence seems to belong to the will, because, as Damascene says:
    “Providence is the will of God, which brings all existing things to a
    suitable end.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. We do not call those people provident who know what to do but are
    unwilling to do it. Providence, therefore, is related more to the will than
    to knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. As Boethius says, God governs the world by His goodness. Now, goodness
    pertains to the will. Therefore, providence also pertains to the will, since
    the role of providence is to govern.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. To dispose things is a function, not of knowledge, but of will. Now,
    according to Boethius, providence is the plan according to which God
    disposes all things. Providence, therefore, pertains to the will, not to
    knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. What is provided for, taken simply as such, is neither a wise thing nor a
    known thing. It is merely a good. Consequently, one who provides, taken as
    such, is not wise, but good. Hence, providence does not pertain to wisdom,
    but to goodness or to the will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary (Second Series)</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Furthermore, it seems that providence pertains to power. For Boethius
    says: “Providence has given to the things it has created the greatest reason
    for enduring, so that as far as they are able, all things naturally desire
    to endure.” Providence, therefore, is a principle of creation. But, since
    creation is appropriated to God’s power, providence pertains to power.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Government is the effect of providence, for the Book of Wisdom (14:3)
    says: “But thy providence, O Father, governeth all.” But, as Hugh of St.
    Victor says, the will commands, wisdom directs, and power executes. Power,
    therefore, is more closely related to government than is knowledge or will.
    Consequently, providence pertains more to power than to knowledge or will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Because our intellects are weak, what we know of God we have to learn from
    creatures, around us. Consequently, to know how God is said to be provident,
    we have to see how creatures are provident.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    We should first note that Cicero makes providence a part of prudence.
    Providence, as it were, completes prudence, since the other two parts of
    prudence, memory and understanding, are merely preparations for the prudent
    act. Moreover, according to the Philosopher,” prudence is the reasoned plan
    of doing things. Now, things to be done differ from things to be made,
    because the latter start from an agent and terminate in some extrinsic
    matter, as, for example, a bench and a house; and the reasoned plan of
    making them is called art. On the other hand, things to be done are actions
    which do not go outside the agent, but, instead, are acts that perfect him,
    as, for example, chaste living, bearing oneself patiently, and the like. The
    reasoned plan of performing these is called prudence. With respect to
    action, two things should be considered: the end and the means.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    However, it is especially the role of prudence to direct the means to the
    end; and, as we read in the <i>Ethics</i>, one is called prudent if he
    deliberates well. But, as we also read in the <i>Ethics</i>, deliberation
    “is not concerned with ends, but only with means.” Now, the end of things to
    be done pre-exists in us in two ways: first, through the natural knowledge
    we have of man’s end. This knowledge, of course, as the Philosopher says,
    belongs to the intellect, which is a principle of things to be done as well
    as of things to be studied; and, as the Philosopher also points out, ends
    are principles of things to be done. The second way that these ends
    pre-exist in us is through our desires. Here, the ends of things to be done
    exist in us in our moral virtues, which influence a man to live a just,
    brave, or temperate life. This is, in a sense, the proximate end of things
    to be done. We are similarly perfected with respect to the means towards
    this end: our knowledge is perfected by counsel, our appetite, by choice;
    and in these matters we are directed by prudence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It is clear, therefore, that it belongs to prudence to dispose, in an
    orderly way, the means towards an end. And because this disposing of means
    to an end is done by prudence, it can be said to take place by a kind of
    reasoning process, whose first principles are ends. The very reason for the
    sequence described above—and found in all things to be done—is taken from
    ends, as is clear in the case of art products. Consequently, if one would be
    prudent, he must stand in the proper relation to the ends themselves, for a
    reasoned plan cannot exist unless the principles of reason are maintained.
    Hence, prudence requires not only the understanding of ends but also moral
    virtues by which the will is settled in a correct end. For this reason, the
    Philosopher says that the prudent man must be virtuous. Finally, this is
    common to all rightly ordered powers and acts of the soul: the virtue of
    what is first is maintained in all the rest. Consequently, in prudence, in
    some way, are included both the will as directed towards an end and the
    knowledge of the end itself.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    From what has been said it is now clear how providence is related to God’s
    other attributes. His knowledge is related both to ends and to means toward
    ends, because through knowledge God knows Himself and creatures. But
    providence pertains only to that knowledge which is concerned with means to
    ends and in so far as these means are ordained to ends. Consequently, in God
    providence includes both knowledge and will, although, taken essentially, it
    belongs only to knowledge, that is, to practical, not to speculative,
    knowledge. Providence, moreover, also includes the power of execution;
    hence, an act of power presupposes an act of providence, as it were,
    directing it, and for this reason power is not included in providence as the
    will is.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Two aspects of a creature can be considered: first, its species taken
    absolutely; second, its relation to an end. The form of each exists
    previously in God. The exemplary form of a thing considered absolutely in
    its species is an idea; but the form of a thing considered as directed to an
    end is called providence. Moreover, according to Boethius, the order divine
    providence implants in things is called fate. Consequently, providence is
    related to fate as an idea is related to the species of a thing. An idea,
    however, can in some way pertain to speculative knowledge; but providence is
    related only to practical knowledge, since it implies an ordering to an end,
    and, consequently, to something to be done, by means of which the end will
    be reached.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Providence pertains more to the will than does practical knowledge taken
    absolutely, because the latter is concerned in general only with the
    knowledge of an end and of the means to achieve it. Consequently, practical
    knowledge does not presuppose that an end has been willed. If this were
    true, then the will would be included in knowledge, as has been said with
    regard to providence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Purity of understanding is mentioned, not to exclude the will from the
    concept of providence, but to exclude change and mutability.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. In this passage Boethius is not giving a complete description of the
    nature of providence. He is merely giving the reason for its name.
    Consequently, even though looking upon things may be considered as
    speculative knowledge, it does not follow that providence may be considered
    to be such. Besides, Boethius explains providence, or foresight, as though
    it were far-sight, because “God Himself surveys all things from their
    highest summit.” But God is on the highest summit of things for the very
    reason that He causes and directs all things. So, even in the words of
    Boethius something pertaining to practical knowledge can be noted.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. The comparison Boethius makes is taken from the resemblance had by the
    proportion between the simple and the composite to the proportion between a
    body at rest and a body in motion. For, just as understanding is simple and
    non-discursive but reason is discursive, passing from one thing to another,
    similarly, providence is simple and unchangeable but fate is multiple and
    changeable. The conclusion, therefore, does not follow.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. Properly speaking, God’s providence is not the eternal law; it is
    something that follows upon the eternal law. The eternal law should be
    thought of as existing in God as those principles of action exist in us
    which we know naturally and upon which we base our deliberation and choice.
    These belong to prudence or providence. Consequently, the law of our
    intellect is related to prudence as an indemonstrable principle is related
    to a demonstration. Similarly, the eternal law in God is not His providence,
    but, as it were, a principle of His providence; for this reason one can,
    without any inconsistency, attribute an act of providence to the eternal law
    in the same way that he attributes every conclusion of a demonstration to
    self-evident principles.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. There are two types of causality to be found in the divine attributes.
    The first type is exemplary causality. Because of this type, we say that all
    living beings come from the first living being. This type of causality is
    common to all the divine attributes. The second type of causality is
    according to the relation the attributes have to their objects. We say, for
    example, that divine power is the cause of the possibles, divine knowledge
    is the cause of what is known. An effect of this type of causality need not
    resemble its cause; for the things that are made by knowledge need not be
    knowledge, but merely known. It is according to this type of causality that
    the providence of God is said to be the cause of all things. Consequently,
    even though the natural law within our understanding is derived from
    providence, it does not follow that divine providence is the eternal law.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. “That divine plan within the highest ruler” is not called providence
    unless one includes in it the notion of direction to an end, which, in turn,
    presupposes that an end has been willed. Consequently, even though
    providence may essentially belong to knowledge, it also, in some way,
    includes the divine will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. A twofold ordering may be found in things. First, there is that order
    according to which things come from their principles. Second, there is the
    order according to which they are directed to an end. Now, the divine
    disposing pertains to that order according to which things proceed from
    their principles; for things are said to be disposed inasmuch as they are
    put on different levels by God, who is like an artist arranging the
    different parts of his work in different ways. Consequently, disposition
    seems to pertain to art. Providence, however, implies the ordering which
    directs to an end; for this reason it differs from the divine art and
    disposition. For divine art is so called because of its relation to the
    production of things, but divine disposition is so called because of its
    relation to the order of what has already been produced. Providence,
    however, implies the ordination to an end. Now, we can gather from the end
    of an art product whatever exists in the thing itself. Moreover, the
    ordering of a thing to an end is more closely related to the end than is the
    ordering of its parts to each other. In fact, their ordering to an end is,
    in a sense, the cause of the ordering of the parts to each other.
    Consequently, divine providence is, in a sense, the cause of God’s
    disposition of things, and for this reason an act of His disposition is
    sometimes attributed to His providence. Therefore, even if providence is not
    an art related to the production of things or a disposition related to the
    ordering of things one to another, it does not follow that providence does
    not belong to practical knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Contrary Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. With reference to the difficulty about the will, we reply that Damascene
    calls providence will inasmuch as providence includes and presupposes the
    will, as we have pointed out previously.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. As the Philosopher says, no man can be prudent unless he has moral
    virtues which rightly dispose him toward his ends, just as no one can
    demonstrate properly unless he knows well the principles of demonstration.
    It is for this reason that no one is said to be provident unless he has a
    correct will—not because providence is in the will.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. God is said to govern through His goodness, not because His goodness is
    providence, but because, having the nature of an end, His goodness is a
    principle of providence. He is also said to govern through His goodness
    because the divine goodness is related to God as moral virtues are to us.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Even though the disposition of things presupposes the will, it is not an
    act of the will, because, as the Philosopher says, ordering, which is what
    is meant by disposition, is the act of one who is wise. Consequently, both
    disposition and providence really belong to knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Providence is compared to what is provided for as knowledge is compared
    to what is known—not as knowledge is compared to the knower. Consequently,
    it is not necessary that what is foreseen, taken as such, be wise, but
    rather that it be known.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. No agent that acts from natural necessity acts through providence.
        But God acts upon created things through the necessity of nature,
        because, as Dionysius says: “The divine goodness communicates itself to
        us like the sun, which, without previous choice or knowledge, pours out
        its rays upon all bodies.” The world, therefore, is not ruled by the
        providence of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. A principle having many forms is posterior to a principle having but
        one form. Now, the will is a multiform principle because it is related
        to opposites. Consequently, providence is also multiform, since it
        presupposes will. On the other hand, nature is a principle having but
        one form, because it is determined to one. Therefore, nature precedes
        providence. Consequently, the realm of nature is not ruled by
        providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. But it was said that a principle having one form precedes a multiform
        principle in the same genus, not in other genera.—On the contrary, the
        greater the power that a principle has of exercising causality, the
        greater is its priority. But the more a principle has but one form, the
        greater is its power of causality, since, as said in <i>The Causes</i>:
        “A united power is more infinite than one that is multiplied.”
        Consequently, a principle having but one form precedes a multiform
        principle whether they are in the same genus or in different genera.

        4. According to Boethius, any inequality is reduced to an equality and
        any multitude to a unity. Therefore, any multiple act of the will ought
        to be reduced to an act of nature that is simple and equal. Hence, the
        first cause must work through its own essence and nature, and not
        through providence. Thus, our original argument stands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. What is, of itself, determined to one course of action does not need
        the direction of anything else, because direction <i>is</i> applied to a
        thing to prevent it from taking a contrary course. Natural things,
        however, are determined to one course of action by their own natures.
        Consequently, they do not need the direction of providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. But it was said that natural things need the direction of providence
        to be kept in being.—On the contrary, if no possibility of corruption
        exists in a thing, it has no need of something extrinsic to conserve it.
        Now, there are some things in which there is no potency to corruption,
        since there is none to generation, as, for example, the celestial bodies
        and the spiritual substances, which are the most important things in the
        universe. Therefore, substances of this sort do not need providence to
        keep them in being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. There are certain things in the realm of nature that even God cannot
        change, such as the principle that “one cannot assert and deny the same
        thing under the same aspect,” and “what has existed cannot not have
        existed,” as Augustine says. Therefore, at least principles of this sort
        do not need divine rule and conservation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Damascene points out that it would be illogical to say that the one
        who makes things is other than the one who exercises providence over
        them. Material bodies, however, are not made by God, since He is a
        spirit, and it seems no more possible for a spirit to produce a material
        body than for a material body to produce a spirit. Material bodies of
        this sort, therefore, are not ruled through divine providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. The government of things involves distinguishing between things. But
        making things distinct does not seem to be the work of God, because, as
        said in <i>The Causes</i>, God is related to all things in one way.
        Therefore, things are dot ruled through divine providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Things ordered of themselves need not be ordered by others. But
        natural things are ordered of themselves, because, as is said in
        <i>The Soul</i>: “For all things naturally constituted there is a term
        and proportion set to their size and growth.” Natural things, therefore,
        are not ordered by divine providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. If things were ruled by divine providence, we could know divine
        providence by studying the order of nature. But, as Damascene says: “We
        should wonder at all things, praise all things, and accept without
        question all the works of providence.” The world, therefore, is not
        ruled by providence.

        2.Whatever has a fixed order must be ruled by a providence. But natural
        things have a fixed order in their motions. Hence, they are ruled by
        providence.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Things which have different natures remain joined only if they are
        ruled by a providence. For this reason, certain philosophers were forced
        to say that the soul is a harmony, because contraries remain joined
        together in the bodies of animals. Now, we see that in the world
        contraries and things of different natures are kept together.
        Consequently, the world is ruled by providence.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. As Boethius says: “Fate directs the motion of all things and
        determines their places, forms, and time. This unfolding of the temporal
        order, united in the foresight of God’s mind, is providence.”“
        Therefore, since we see that things have distinct forms, times, or
        places, we must admit the existence of fate and, consequently, that of
        providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Whatever cannot keep itself in existence needs something else to rule
        it and keep it in existence. But created things cannot keep themselves
        in existence, for, as Damascene says, what is made from nothing tends,
        of itself, to return to nothing. There must, therefore, be a providence
        ruling over things.

        Providence is concerned with the direction of things to an end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, as the Commentator says, whoever denies final causality
        should also deny providence. Now, those who deny final causality take
        two positions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Some of the very ancient philosophers admitted only a material cause.
        Since they would not admit an efficient cause, they could not affirm the
        existence of an end, for an end is a cause only in so far as it moves
        the efficient cause. Other and later philosophers admitted an efficient
        cause, but said nothing about a final cause. According to both schools,
        everything was necessarily caused by previously existing causes,
        material or efficient.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This position, however, was criticized by other philosophers on the
        following grounds. Material and efficient causes, as such, cause only
        the existence of their effects. They are not sufficient to produce
        goodness in them so that they be aptly disposed in themselves, so that
        they could continue to exist, and toward others so that they could help
        them. Heat, for example, of its very nature and of itself can break down
        other things, but this breaking down is good and helpful only if it
        happens up to a certain point and in a certain way. Consequently, if we
        do not admit that there exist in nature causes other than heat and
        similar agents, we cannot give any reason why things happen in a good
        and orderly way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Moreover, whatever does not have a determinate cause happens by
        accident. Consequently, if the position mentioned above were true, all
        the harmony and usefulness found in things would be the result of
        chance. This was actually what Empedocles held. He asserted that it was
        by accident that the parts of animals came together in this way through
        friendship—and this was his explanation of an animal and of a frequent
        occurrence! This explanation, of course, is absurd, for those things
        that happen by chance, happen only rarely; we know from experience,
        however, that harmony and usefulness are found in nature either at all
        times or at least for the most part. This cannot be the result of mere
        chance; it must be because an end is intended. What lacks intellect or
        knowledge, however, cannot tend directly toward an end. It can do this
        only if someone else’s knowledge has established an end for it, and
        directs it to that end. Consequently, since natural things have no
        knowledge, there must be some previously existing intelligence directing
        them to an end, like an archer who gives a definite motion to an arrow
        so that it will wing its way to a determined end. Now, the hit made by
        the arrow is said to be the work not of the arrow alone but also of the
        person who shot it. Similarly, philosophers call every work of nature
        the work of intelligence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consequently, the world is ruled by the providence of that intellect
        which gave this order to nature; and we may compare the providence by
        which God rules the world to the domestic foresight by which a man rules
        his family, or to the political foresight by which a ruler governs a
        city or a kingdom, and directs the acts of others to a definite end.
        There is no providence, however, in God with respect to Himself, since
        whatever is in Him is an end, not a means to it.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The metaphor used by Dionysius notes merely that, like the sun which,
        on its own part, keeps no body from sharing its light, the divine
        goodness keeps no creature from participating in itself. The metaphor
        does not mean that providence acts without choice or knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. A principle can be said to be multiform in two senses. First, the
        multiformity can refer to the very essence of the principle—that is, the
        principle is composite. A principle that is multiform in this sense must
        be posterior to a principle having but one form. Second, the
        multiformity may refer to the principle’s relation to its effects, so
        that a principle is said to be multiform because it extends its
        influence to many things. A principle that is multiform in this sense
        precedes one that has but a single form, because the more simple a
        principle is, the more extensive is its influence. It is in this sense,
        moreover, that the will is said to be a multiform, and nature, a uniform
        principle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The argument given is based on the uniformity of a principle
        according to its essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. God is the cause of things by His essence. Consequently, any
        plurality in things can be reduced to one simple principle. His essence,
        however, is the cause of things only in so far as it is known, and
        consequently, only in so far as it wills to be communicated to a
        creature by the creature’s being made in its likeness. Hence, things
        proceed from the divine essence through the ordering of knowledge and
        will, and so through providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. That determination by which a natural thing is restricted to one
        course of action belongs to it, not because of itself, but because of
        something else. Consequently, the very determination for bringing about
        the suitable effect is, as has been said, a proof of divine providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Generation and corruption can be understood in two senses. First,
        generation and corruption can arise from a contrary being and terminate
        in a contrary. In this sense, the potency to generation and corruption
        exists in a thing because its matter is in potency to contrary forms;
        and in this respect celestial bodies and spiritual substances have no
        potency to generation or corruption. Second, these terms are commonly
        used to indicate any coming into or passing out of existence that is
        found in things. Consequently, even creation, by which a thing is drawn
        from nothingness into existence, is called generation; and the
        annihilation of a thing is called corruption.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Moreover, a thing is said to be in potency to generation in this sense
        if an agent has the power to produce it; and it is said to be in potency
        to corruption if an agent has the power to reduce it to nothingness. In
        this way of speaking, every creature is in potency to corruption; for
        all that God has brought into existence He can also reduce to
        nothingness. For, as Augustine says, for creatures to subsist God must
        constantly work in them. This action of God, however, must not be
        compared to the action of a craftsman building a house, for, when his
        action ceases, the house still remains; it should rather be compared to
        the sun’s lighting up the air. Consequently, when God no longer gives
        existence to a creature, whose very existence depends on His will, then
        this creature is reduced to nothingness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The necessity of the principles mentioned depends upon God’s
        providence and disposition, because the fact that created things have a
        particular nature and, in this nature, a determined act of existence,
        makes these things distinct from their negations; and upon this
        distinction is based the principle that affirmation and negation cannot
        be truee simultaneously. Moreover, on this principle, as we read in the
        <i>Meta</i> p <i>hysics</i>, the necessity of all the other principles
        is founded.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. An effect cannot be stronger than its cause. It can, however, be
        weaker than its cause. Now, since body is naturally inferior to spirit,
        it cannot produce a spirit; but a spirit can produce a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. God is similarly said to be related to all things, because there is
        no diversity in Him. He is, however, the cause of diversity in things
        inasmuch as by His knowledge He contains within Himself the intelligible
        characters of all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. That order which is found in nature is not caused by nature but by
        something else. Consequently, nature needs providence to implant such an
        order in it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Creatures fail to represent their creator adequately. Consequently,
        through them we cannot arrive at a perfect knowledge of God. Another
        reason for our imperfect knowledge is the weakness of our intellect,
        which cannot assimilate all the evidence of God that is to be found in
        creatures. It is for this reason that we are forbidden to scrutinize
        God’s attributes over-zealously in the sense of aiming at the completion
        of such an inquiry, an aim which is implied in the very notion of
        overzealous scrutiny. If we were to act thus, we would not believe
        anything about God unless our intellect could grasp it. We are not,
        however, kept from humbly investigating God’s attributes, remembering
        that we are too weak to arrive at a perfect comprehension of Him.
        Consequently, Hilary writes as follows: “Even if a man who reverently
        seeks the infinite ways of God never reaches the end of his search, his
        search will always profit him.”

        1. A cause and its effects are in the same order. Now, corruptible
        creatures are the cause of sin. This is evident. For example, women’s
        beauty is an incitement to and cause of lust. Moreover, Wisdom (14:11)
        says: “The creatures of God have been turned into... a snare for the
        feet of the unwise.” Now, since sin is outside the order of divine
        providence, it seems that corruptible beings are not subject to this
        order.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Nothing that a wise man arranges can destroy his work, because he,
        would be contradicting himself were he to build and destroy the same
        thing. Now, we find among corruptible things some that are contrary to
        and destructive of others. Consequently, corruptible things were not
        arranged by God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Damascene speaks as follows: “It must be true that all things
        happening according to God’s providence take place according to right
        reason in a way that is best and most fitting in God’s eyes—indeed, in a
        way that is better for them to take place.” But corruptible things could
        become better, for they could become incorruptible. The providence of
        God he ore, does not extend to corruptible things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Whatever is corruptible has corruption in it by its very nature;
        otherwise it would not be necessary for all corruptible things to
        corrupt. But, since corruption is a defect, it is not provided for by
        God, who cannot be a cause of any defect. Corruptible natures,
        therefore, do not come under God’s providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. As Dionysius says, providence does not destroy nature but saves it.
        The role of God’s providence, therefore, is to save things continually.
        But corruptible things are not continually saved. They are not,
        therefore, subject to God’s providence.

        2. Wisdom (12:13) also says that it is God who “hast care of all

        As we said above 4 the providence by which God rules things is similar
        to the providence by which the father of a family rules his household or
        a king rules a city or kingdom. The common element in these rules is the
        primacy of the common good over the good of the individual; for, as we
        read in the <i>Ethics</i>, the good of the nation is more divine than
        that of the city, family, or person. Consequently, whoever is
        supervising must—if he is to rule wisely—pay more attention to what is
        good for the community than to what is good merely for an individual.

        Some have not kept this point in mind, but considering only that there

        and not considering the order of the universe in which each and every
        thing is excellently arranged—some, I say, have said that those
        corruptible things are therefore not ruled by God but that only
        incorruptible things are. These persons are represented in Job (22:14)
        by the man who says: “The clouds are God’s covert, and he doth not
        consider our things, and he walketh about the poles of heaven.”
        Moreover, they assert that corruptible things act necessarily and
        without any ruler at all or are ruled by an opposing principle. The
        Philosopher, however, has refuted” this position by taking an army as an
        example. In an army we find two orders, one by which the parts of the
        army are related to each other, and a second by which the army is
        directed to an external good, namely, the good of its leader. That order
        by which the parts of the army are related to each other exists for the
        sake of the order by which the entire army is subordinated to its
        leader. Consequently, if the subordination to the leader did not exist,
        the ordering of the parts of the army to each other would not exist.
        Consequently, whenever we find a group whose members are ordered to each
        other, that group must necessarily be ordered to some external
        principle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, the corruptible and incorruptible parts of the universe are related
        to each other essentially, not accidentally. For we see that corruptible
        bodies benefit from celestial bodies, and always, or at least
        ordinarily, in the same manner. Consequently, all things, corruptible
        and incorruptible, must be in one order under the providence of an
        external principle outside the universe. For this reason, the
        Philosopher concluded that it was necessary to affirm the existence of a
        single rule over the universe, and of not more than one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It must be noted, however, that a thing is provided for in two ways: for
        itself, or for other things. For example, in a home, care is taken of
        some things on their own account, namely, those things that constitute
        the essential goods of a household, such as sons, possessions, and the
        like; and other things, such as utensils, animals, and the like are
        cared for so that the essential things can use them. Similarly, in the
        universe, the things in which the essential perfection of the universe
        consists are provided for on their own account, and like the universe
        itself, these things stay in existence. But the things that do not
        endure are provided for, not for their own sake, but for the sake of
        other things. Consequently, spiritual substances and heavenly bodies,
        which are perpetual both as species and as individuals, are provided for
        on their own account both as species and as individuals. Corruptible
        things, however, are perpetual only as a species; hence, these species
        are looked after for their own sake, but the individual members of these
        species are not provided for except for this reason: to keep the species
        in perpetual existence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If we thus understand the opinion of those who say that divine
        providence does not extend to corruptible things of this kind, except as
        they participate in the nature of a species, it need not be rejected;
        for this opinion is true if it is understood as referring to the
        providence of things by which they are provided for on their own
        account.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Of themselves, corruptible creatures do not cause sin. They are only
        its occasion and accidental cause. Now, an accidental cause and its
        effect do not have to belong to the same order.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. A wise provider does not consider what is good for merely one of the
        things that fall under his providence. He is concerned rather with what
        is better for all. Consequently, even though the corruption of a thing
        in the universe is not good for that thing, it is good for the
        perfection of the entire universe, because the continual generation and
        corruption of individuals makes it possible for the species to be
        perpetual; and it is in this that the perfection of the universe
        essentially consists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although a corruptible thing would be better if it possessed
        incorruptibility, it is better for the universe to be made of both
        corruptible and incorruptible things than to be made merely of the
        latter, because the nature of the corruptible thing, as well as that of
        the incorruptible, is good, and it is better to have two goods than
        merely one. Moreover, multiplication of individuals in one nature is of
        less value than a variety of natures, since the good found in a nature,
        being communicable, is superior to the good found in an individual,
        which is incommunicable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Darkness is brought about by the sun, not because of any action of
        the sun, but because the sun does not send out light. Similarly,
        corruption comes from God, not because of any positive action by Him,
        but because He does not give the thing permanency.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The things that are provided for by God on their own account last
        forever. But this permanency is not necessary for those things that are
        not provided for on their own account. These need remain only so long as
        they are needed by the things for which they are provided. Consequently,
        as is clear from the previous discussion, certain things corrupt because
        they are not looked after for their own sakes.

        1. God does not provide for a thing if He is not its author, because, as
        Damascene says,’ it is illogical to say that one person makes a thing
        and another provides for it. Now, God is not the author of evil, for to
        the extent that things come from Him they are good. Therefore, since
        many evil things happen in the actions and motions of creatures here
        below, it does not seem that all of their motions fall under His divine
        providence,
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2.Motions that are contrary do not seem to belong to the same order.
        Now, in creatures here below there are contrary motions and actions.
        Consequently, it is impossible that they all fall under the order of
        divine providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. A thing falls under divine providence only inasmuch as it is directed
        to an end. But evil is not ordered to an end. On the contrary, it is a
        privation of order. Consequently, evil does not fall under providence.
        In creatures here below, however, many evils occur. Therefore.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. A man is not prudent if he allows something evil to occur in those
        things whose actions fall under his providence when he can prevent that
        evil from taking place. Now, God is most prudent and powerful. Hence,
        since many evils occur in creatures here below, it seems that certain of
        their acts do not fall under divine providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. It was said, however, that God permits these evils to happen because
        He can draw good from them.—On the contrary, good is more powerful than
        evil, so it is easier to draw good from good than good from evil.
        Consequently, it is not necessary for God to permit evil to happen in
        order to draw good from it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. As Boethius says, just as God creates all things through His
        goodness, so does He also govern all things by His goodness. But His
        divine goodness does not permit Him to make anything evil. Consequently,
        His goodness does not permit anything evil from coming under His
        providence
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. If a thing is arranged, it does not happen by chance. Therefore, if
        all the motions of creatures here below were arranged, nothing would
        happen by chance, but everything would happen by necessity. This,
        however, is impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. As the Commentator says, if everything happened in creatures here
        below because of the necessity of matter, they would not be ruled by
        providence. But many things in creatures here below happen because of
        the necessity of matter. At least these events, then, are not ruled by
        providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. No prudent man permits a good so that evil will result. For the same
        reason, therefore, no prudent man permits an evil that good will result.
        Since God is prudent, He will therefore not permit evils in order that
        good will result. Consequently, it seems that the evils occurring in
        creatures here below are not allowed by providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. What is blameworthy in a man should by no means be attributed to
        God. But a man is blamed if he does wrong in order to get something
        good. This is clear from the Epistle to the Romans (3:8): “As we are
        slandered, and as some affirm that we say: Let us do evil, that there
        may come good.” Consequently, it is contrary to God’s nature for evil to
        come under His providence in order that good may be drawn from it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. If the acts of bodies here below were subject to God’s providence,
        they would act in harmony with God’s justice. But the lower elements do
        not act in this way: fire burns the homes of the just as well as those
        of the unjust. Consequently, acts of lower bodies do not fall under
        God’s providence.

        1. In the Gospel according to Matthew (10:29), we read: “Are not two
        sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall on the
        ground without your Father.” On this, the Gloss reads: “Great is the
        providence of God. Not even the smallest things escape it.”
        Consequently, even the smallest movement of things here below comes
        under God’s providence.

        2. Augustine writes as follows: “It is because of God’s providence that
        we see celestial bodies ordered from on high, stars and planets of the
        earth shining down on us below, the regular alternation of night and
        day, the rugged earth being cleansed by surrounding waves of water, air
        gushing out in the heavens, shrubs and animals being conceived and born,
        growing, wasting away, and killing, and all things else that happen by
        interior, natural motion.” Consequently, all motions of lower bodies
        fall under God’s providence.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Since the first principle of things is the same as their final end,
        things come from their first principle and are ordered to their ultimate
        end in the same manner. Studying things as they come from their
        principle, however, we find that those which are close to their
        principle have an unfailing act of existence, but, as is said in
        <i>Generation and Corruption,</i> those that are remote from their
        principle have a corruptible act of existence. Consequently, with
        respect to their relation to an end, those things that are closest to
        their ultimate end unfailingly keep their direction to their end, but
        those that are remote from their ultimate end sometimes diverge from
        their direction to it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Moreover, the same things that are close to their principle are close to
        their end, and those that are remote from their principle are remote
        from their end. Consequently, not only have incorruptible substances an
        unfailing act of existence, but also their actions never fail to keep
        their direction to an end. For example, there are heavenly bodies whose
        motions never leave their natural orbit. However because corruptible
        bodies have defective natures, many of their movements diverge from
        their proper order. It is for this reason that, in regard to the order
        of the universe, the Philosopher compares incorruptible bodies to
        children in a household who always do what is good for the home, and
        corruptible bodies to domestic animals and slaves whose actions
        frequently violate the order laid down by the one in charge of the
        household. This is the reason, too, why Avicenna says that nothing evil
        lies beyond the moon and that there is evil only in creatures here
        below.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It should not be thought, however, that those acts of things here below
        which are outside their proper course are entirely outside the order of
        providence. For a thing comes under God’s providence in two ways: it can
        be something to which something else is ordered or it can be something
        that is ordered to something else. Now, as said in the
        <i>Physics</i> and in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, in an order of means to an
        end, all the intermediate members are ends as well as means to an end.
        Consequently, whatever is rightly ordered by providence comes under
        providence not only as something that is referred to something else, but
        also as something to which another thing is referred. However, a thing
        which leaves the right order comes under providence only as something
        referred, to something else, not as something to which another thing has
        been referred. For example, the act of the generative powers by which a
        man generates another complete in his nature is directed by God to a
        particular thing, namely, a human form; and to the act itself something
        else is directed, namely, the generative power. A defective act which
        results occasionally in the generation of natural monstrosities is, of
        course, directed by God to some useful purpose; but to this defective
        act itself nothing else was directed. It happened merely on account of
        the failure of some cause. With regard to the first-named act of
        generation, the providence is one of approval; with regard to the
        second, it is one of permission. These two kinds of providence are
        discussed by Damascene.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It should be noted, however, that some have restricted God’s providence
        to only the species of natural things, and have excluded it from
        individuals except as they participate in a common nature. They did this
        because they did not admit that God knows singulars, but said that God
        directs the nature of a species in such a way that the resultant power
        of a species can bring about a certain action, and, if this should fail
        at times, the failure itself is directed to something useful—just as the
        corruption of one thing is directed to the generation of another. They
        denied, however, that a particular force is directed to a particular act
        and that this particular failure is directed to this particular use. But
        since we say that God knows all particular things perfectly, we assert
        that all individual things, even as individuals, fall under God’s
        providence.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. That argument touches only the providence of approval. It is true,
        however, that God does not provide for a thing unless He is in some way
        its author. Consequently, since evil does not come from God, it does not
        fall under His providence of approval, but falls only under His
        providence of permission.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Although contrary motions do not belong to the same specific order,
        they do belong to one general order, as do even the different orders of
        different crafts which are subordinated to the order of a city.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Even though evil inasmuch as it issues from its own cause is without
        order and, for this reason, is defined as a privation of order, there is
        nothing that keeps a higher cause from ordering it. In this way evil
        comes under providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Any prudent man will endure a small evil in order that a great good
        will not be prevented. Any particular good, moreover, is trifling in
        comparison with the good of a universal nature. Again, evil cannot be
        kept from certain things without taking away their nature, which is such
        that it may or may not fail; and, while this nature may harm something
        in particular, it nevertheless gives some added beauty to the universe.
        Consequently, since God is most prudent, His providence does not prevent
        evil, but allows each thing to act as its nature requires it to act.
        For, as Dionysius says, the role of providence is to save, not to
        destroy, nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. There are certain goods which can be drawn only from certain evils;
        for example, the good of patience can be drawn only from the evil of
        persecution, and the good of penitence only from the evil of sin. This,
        however, is not to deny that evil is weak in comparison with good,
        because things of this sort are drawn out of evil, not as from an
        essential cause, but, as it were, accidentally and materially.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Inasmuch as it has an act of existence, whatever is made must have
        the form of the one who makes it, because the making of a thing
        terminates in its act of existence. Consequently, an evil cannot be
        produced by a cause that is good. Now, providence directs a thing to an
        end, and this direction to an end follows upon the act of existence of
        the thing. It is not impossible, therefore, for something evil to be
        directed to a good by one who is good, but it is impossible for one who
        is good to direct something to an evil. For, just as the goodness of a
        maker puts the form of goodness in the things he makes, so also does the
        goodness of one who is provident put a direction to good in the things
        that are subject to his providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Effects happening accidentally in creatures here below can be
        considered in two ways: in their relation to proximate causes—and, in
        this sense, many things happen by chance—or in their relation to the
        first cause—and, in this sense, nothing in the world happens by chance.
        It does not follow, therefore, that all things happen necessarily,
        because in necessity and contingency effects do not follow first causes
        but proximate causes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Those things resulting from the necessity of matter are themselves
        determined by natures ordered to an end, and for this reason can also
        fall under divine providence. This would not be possible if everything
        resulted from the necessity of matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Evil is the contrary of good. Now, of itself no contrary brings about
        its contrary, but every contrary brings its contrary to that which is
        similar to itself. For example, heat does not bring a thing to coldness,
        except accidentally. Instead, it reduces cold to warmth. Similarly, no
        good person directs a thing to evil; instead, he directs it to good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. As is clear from the above discussion, to do evil is in no way
        proper to those who are good. To do evil for the sake of a good is
        blameworthy in a man and cannot be attributed to God. On the other hand,
        to direct evil to a good is not opposed to one’s goodness. Hence,
        permitting evil in order to draw some good from it can be attributed to

        It seems that they are not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As Damascene says: “What is in us is the work not of providence but
        of our own free choice.” <i>What is in us</i> means our human actions.
        Consequently, these do not fall under God’s providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Of the things coming under God’s providence, the more noble a thing
        is, the more elaborately is it provided for. Now, man is more noble than
        those creatures that lack sensation and, never departing from their
        course, rarely, if ever, deviate from the right order. Men’s actions,
        however, frequently deviate from the right order. Hence, they are not
        ruled by providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The evil of sin is very hateful to God. But no one who is provident
        permits what is most displeasing to him to happen for the sake of
        something else, because this would mean that the absence of the latter
        would be even more displeasing to him. Consequently, since God permits
        the evil of sin to occur in human acts, it seems that they are not ruled
        by His providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. What is abandoned does not fall under the rule of providence. But, as
        we read in Sirach (15:14): “God left man in the hand of his own
        counsel.” Human acts, therefore, are not ruled by providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. In Ecclesiastes (9:11) we read: “I saw that... the race is not to the
        swift, nor the battle to the strong... but time and chance in all.”
        Since the author is speaking about human acts, it seems that men’s
        actions are subject to the whims of chance and are not ruled by
        providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. By the rule of providence, different allotments are made to different
        things. But in human affairs the same things happen to the good and to
        the evil; for, as we read in Ecclesiastes (9:2): “All things equally
        happen to the just and to the wicked, to the good and to the evil.”
        Consequently, human affairs are not ruled by providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. In the Gospel according to Matthew (10:30) is written: “The very
        hairs of your head are all numbered.” Even the least of human acts,
        therefore, is directed by God’s providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. To punish, reward, and issue commands are acts of providence because
        it is through acts of this kind that every provider governs his
        subjects. Now, God does all these things in connection with human acts.
        Consequently, all human acts are ruled by His providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As pointed out previously, the closer a being is to the first principle,
        the higher is its place in the order of providence. Now, among all
        things, spiritual substances stand closest to the first principle; this
        is why they are said to be stamped with God’s image. Consequently, by
        God’s providence they are not only provided for, but they are provident
        themselves. This is why these substances can exercise a choice in their
        actions while other creatures cannot. The latter are provided for, but
        they themselves are not provident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, since providence is concerned with directing to an end, it must
        take place with the end as its norm; and since the first provider is
        Himself the end of His providence, He has the norm of providence within
        Himself. Consequently, it is impossible that any of the failures in
        those things for which He provides should be due to Him; the failures in
        these things can be due only to the objects of His providence. Now,
        creatures to whom His providence has been communicated are not the ends
        of their own providence. They are directed to another end, namely, God.
        Hence, it is necessary that they draw the rectitude of their own
        providence from God’s norm. Consequently, in the providence exercised by
        creatures failures may take place that are due, not only to the objects
        of their providence, but also to the providers themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, the more faithful a creature is to the norm of the first
        provider, the firmer will be the rectitude of his own providence.
        Consequently, it is because creatures of this sort can fail in their
        actions and are the cause of their actions, that their failures are
        culpable something which is not true of the failures of other creatures.
        Moreover, because these spiritual creatures are incorruptible even as
        individuals, they are provided for on their own account as individuals.
        Hence, defects that take place in them are destined to a reward or
        punishment which will belong to these individuals themselves—and not to
        them only as they are ordered to other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, man is numbered among these creatures, because his form—that is,
        his soul—is a spiritual being, the root of all his human acts, and that
        by which even his body has a relation to immortality. Consequently,
        human acts come under divine providence according as men themselves have
        providence over their own acts; and the defects in these acts are
        ordained according to what belongs to these men themselves, not only
        according to what belongs to others. For example, when a man sins, God
        orders the sin to the sinner’s good, so that after his fall, upon rising
        again, he may be a more humble person; or it is ordered at least to a
        good which is brought about in him by divine justice when he is punished
        for his sin. The defects happening in sensible creatures, however, are
        directed only to what belongs to others; for example, the corruption of
        some particular fire is directed to the generation of some particular
        air. Consequently, to designate this special manner of providence which
        God exercises over human acts, Wisdom (12:18) says: “Thou with great
        favour disposest of us.”

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The statement of Damascene does not mean that the things in us (that
        is, in our power to choose) are entirely outside of God’s providence,
        but it means rather that our choice is not determined to one course of
        action by divine providence, as are the actions of those beings which do
        not possess freedom.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Natural things lacking sensation are provided for by God alone.
        Consequently, no failure here is possible on the part of the one who
        provides, but only on the part of the objects of His providence. But
        human acts can be defective because of human providence. For this
        reason, we find more failures and deordinations in human acts than we do
        in the acts of natural things. Yet, the fact that man has providence
        over his own acts is part of his nobility, Consequently, the number of
        his failures does not keep man from holding a higher place under God’s
        providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. God loves a thing more if it is a greater good. Consequently, He
        wills the presence of a greater good more than He wills the absence of a
        lesser evil (for even the absence of an evil is a certain good). So, in
        order that certain greater goods may be had, He permits certain persons
        to fall even into the evils of sin, which, taken as a class, are most
        hateful, even though one of them may be more hateful to Him than
        another. Consequently, to cure a man of one sin, God sometimes permits
        him to fall into another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. “God leaves man in the hand of his own counsel” in the sense that He
        gives him providence over his own acts. Man’s providence over his acts,
        however, does not exclude God’s providence over them, just as the active
        power of creatures does not exclude the active power of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Even though many of our human acts are the result of chance if we
        consider only lower causes, still, if we consider the providence which
        God has over all things, there is nothing that results from chance.
        Indeed, the very fact that so many things happen in human affairs when,
        if we consider merely lower causes, just the opposite should happen,
        proves that human actions are governed by God’s providence. Hence, the
        powerful frequently fall, for this shows that one is victorious because
        of God’s providence and not because of any human power. The same can be
        said of other cases.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Even though it may seem to us that all things happen equally to the
        good and to the evil since we are ignorant of the reasons for God’s
        providence in allotting these things, there is no doubt that in all
        these good and evil things happening to the good or to the evil there is
        operative a well worked out plan by which God’s providence directs all
        things. It is because we do not know His reasons that we think many
        things happen without order or plan. We are like a man who enters a
        carpenter shop and thinks that there is a useless multiplication of
        tools because he does not know how each one is used; but one who knows
        the trade will see that this number of tools exists for a very good
        reason.

        1. In the first Epistle to the Corinthians (9:9) we read: “Doth God take

        for the same reason.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. In the Book of Habakkuk (1:14) we read: “Thou wilt make men as the
        fishes of the sea...” In this passage, the prophet is lamenting the
        troubling of the order which seems to happen in men’s actions. It seems,
        therefore, that the acts of irrational creatures are not governed by
        divine providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. If a man is punished for no fault of his own, and this punishment
        does not help him in any way, it would not seem that human affairs were
        ruled by providence. Now, brute animals cannot comm it a fault, and,
        when they are killed, their death is not directed to their good, because
        there is no reward for them after death. Their lives, therefore, are not
        ruled by providence.

        4. A thing is not ruled by God’s providence ut is ordained to the end
        which He intends; and this end is nothing other than God Himself.
        Brutes, however, cannot attain to a participation in God, since they are
        not capable of beatitude. Consequently, it seems that divine providence
        does not rule them.

        2. Brutes are more noble than creatures that lack sensation. But these
        other creatures and all their actions come under God’s providence. Even
        more, then, will brutes come under His providence.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In this matter two errors have been made. Some’ have said that brutes
        are not ruled by providence except as they participate in the nature of
        their species, which alone is provided for and directed by God. It is to
        this kind of providence, they say, that all the passage in Scripture
        refer when they seem to imply God’s providence over brutes, for example:
        “Who giveth to beasts their food: and to the young...” (Psalms 146:9);
        “The young lions roaring...” (Psalm 103:21); and many similar passages.
        This error, however, attributes very great imperfection to God.
        Moreover, it is not possible that God should know the individual acts of
        brutes and not direct them, since He is most good and, because He is
        good, pours out His goodness upon all things. Consequently, the error we
        have mentioned belittles either God’s knowledge by denying that He knows
        individual things or His goodness by denying that He directs individual
        things as individuals. For this reason, others have said that the acts
        of brutes, also, fall under providence in the same way in which the acts
        of rational being do. Consequently, no evil would be found in the acts
        of brutes that would not be directed to their good. This position,
        however, is also far from reasonable, for punishment and reward is due
        only to those who have free choice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It must be said, therefore, that brutes and their acts, taken even
        individually, fall under God’s providence, but not in the same way in
        which men and their actions do. For providence is exercised over men,
        even as individuals, for their own sake; but individual brutes are
        provided for merely for the sake of something else—just as other
        corruptible creatures are, as mentioned previously. Hence, the evil that
        happens to a brute is not ordered to the good of the brute but to the
        good of something else, just as the death of an ass is ordered to the
        good of a lion or that of a wolf. But the death of a man killed by a
        lion is directed not merely to the good of the lion, but principally to
        the man’s punishment or to the increase of his merit; for his merit can
        grow if he accepts his sufferings.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The Apostle does not intend to remove brutes entirely from God’s
        care. He simply means to say that God does not care so much for brutes
        that He would impose a law upon men for the sake of brutes, commanding
        men to be good to them or not to kill them; for brutes have been made
        for man’s use. Consequently, providence is not exercised over them for
        their own sake but for the sake of men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. God has so ordered fishes and brutes that the weak are subject to the
        strong. This was done without any consideration of merits or demerits,
        but only for the conservation of the good of nature. The prophet
        wondered, therefore, if human affairs were governed in the same way. For
        this to be true, of course, would be unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. A different order of providence is required for human affairs than is
        required for brutes. Consequently, if the ordering of human affairs were
        only that proper to brutes, human affairs would seem to be entirely
        without providence. Yet, that order is sufficient for the providence of
        brutes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. God Himself is the end of all creatures, but in different ways. He is
        said to be the end of some creatures inasmuch as they participate
        somewhat in God’s image. This participation is common to all creatures.
        However, He is said to be the end of certain creatures inasmuch as they
        can attain God Himself through their own actions. This is the end only
        of rational creatures, who can know and love God in whom their beatitude
        lies.

        Divine providence extends to men in two ways: first, in so far as men
        are provided for; second, in so far as they themselves become providers.
        If they fail in their own providence they are called evil; but if they
        observe the demands of justice they are called good. Moreover in so far
        as they come under providence they are given both good and evil. Now,
        men are provided for in different ways according to the different ways
        they have of providing for themselves. For, if they keep the right order
        in their own providence, God’s providence in their regard will keep an
        ordering that is congruent with their human dignity; that is, nothing
        will happen to them that is not for their own good, and everything that
        happens to them will be to their own advantage, according to what is
        said in the Epistle to the Romans (8:2 8): “To them that love God, all
        things work together unto good.” However, if in their own providence men
        do not keep that order which is congruent with their dignity as rational
        creatures, but provide after the manner of brute animals, then God’s
        providence will dispose of them according to the order that belongs to
        brutes, so that their good and evil acts will not be directed to their
        own profit but to the profit of others, according to the words of the
        Psalmist: “And man when he was in honour did not understand; he is
        compared...” (Psalms 48:13) —From this it is evident that God’s
        providence governs the good in a higher way than it governs the evil.
        For, when the evil leave the order of providence, that is, by not doing
        the will of God, they fall into another order, an order in which the
        will of God is done to them. The good, however, are in the true order of
        His providence in both respects.

        1. God is said to abandon the wicked, not because they are entirely
        alien to His providence, but because their acts are not directed to
        their own profit. This is especially true of the depraved.

        1. In Job (34:13) we read: “What other hath he appointed over the earth?
        or whom hath he set over the world which he hath made?” In his
        commentary on this passage, Gregory says: “By Himself, indeed, He rules
        that world who has created it by Himself.”’ Consequently, God does not
        rule material creatures through the mediation of spirits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Damascene says that it is inconsistent to say that one person makes a
        thing and another rules over it. But, without any medium, God alone
        creates material creatures. Therefore, He governs them without any
        intermediaries.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Hugh of St. Victor says that God’s providence is His predestination,
        which is the highest wisdom and the highest goodness. Now, the highest
        good or wisdom is not communicated to any creature. Therefore, neither
        is providence. Hence, God does not provide for material creatures
        through the mediation of spiritual creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Material creatures are ruled by providence in so far as they are
        directed to an end. But bodies are ordained to their end through their
        natural operations in accordance with their determinate natures.
        Therefore, since the natures of natural bodies are made determinate, not
        by spiritual creatures, but directly by God, it seems that they are not
        governed through the mediation of spiritual substances.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Augustine distinguishes between two types of providential operations:
        “natural and voluntary.” The former he calls natural because it makes
        trees and plants grow; the latter he calls voluntary because it takes
        place through the deeds of angels and men. It is clear, therefore, that
        all material things are ruled by the natural operation of providence,
        not through the mediation of angels, as would be true were they ruled by
        voluntary operation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. What is attributed to one person because of his dignity does not
        belong to another who does not have a similar dignity. Now, Jerome
        writes: “Great is the dignity of souls, each of whom has an angel
        appointed to guard it.” This dignity, however, is not found in material
        creatures; consequently, they are not committed to the providence and
        direction of angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The effects and due courses of these material bodies are frequently
        hindered. This would not happen if they were governed by the mediation
        of angels, because these obstacles would then occur either with the
        consent of the angels—and this is impossible, since it would be contrary
        to that for which angels were appointed, namely, the government of
        natures according to its due order—or they would occur against the
        angels’ will—and this, too, is impossible, since the angels would not be
        in the state of beatitude if something could happen to them which they
        did not want to happen. Therefore, material creatures are not ruled
        through the mediation of spiritual creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The more noble and powerful a cause is, the more perfect is its
        effect. Now, lower causes can produce such effects as can be kept in
        existence even after the operation of their efficient cause ceases; for
        example, a knife continues in existence even after the work of the
        cutler has ceased. Much more so, then, will the effects of God’s power
        be able to exist by themselves without being provided for by any
        efficient cause. Consequently, they do not need to be ruled through
        angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. The divine goodness has created the whole world in order to manifest
        itself; for, as we read in Proverbs (16:4): “The Lord hath made all
        things for himself...” Now, God’s goodness, as Augustine also says, is
        manifested more by a diversity of natures than by a number of things all
        possessing the same nature. For this reason, God did not make all
        creatures rational or all of them to exist in themselves. He made some
        creatures irrational, and some, like accidents, that exist in others.
        Consequently, it seems that for the greater manifestation of Himself God
        created not only creatures that needed the rule of another, but also
        some creatures that needed no rule at all. Hence, our position stands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. There are two types of acts in creatures, first act and second act.
        First act is the form and the act of existence that a form gives. Form
        is called the primarily first act, existence, the secondarily first act.
        Second act, however, is operation. Now, the first act of corporeal
        things comes directly from God. Therefore, their second acts are also
        caused directly by God. But the only way in which one thing governs
        another is by being in some manner the cause of its operations.
        Therefore, material creatures of this sort are not governed through the
        instrumentality of spirits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. According to Augustine, God simultaneously created a world that was
        perfect in all its parts in order that His power might be better shown.
        The praiseworthiness of His providence would similarly be even better
        shown if He were to govern all things directly. Therefore, He does not
        govern material things through the mediation of spirits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. There are two ways of governing. One way is to impart light or
        knowledge; this is the way in which a teacher rules his class, and a
        ruler, his city. The other way is to impart motion to a thing; this is
        the way in which a pilot guides his ship. Now, spiritual creatures do
        not govern material creatures by imparting light or knowledge, because
        these material things cannot receive knowledge, nor do they govern them
        by imparting motion, because, as is proved in the <i>Physics</i>, a
        mover must be joined to what he moves, and spiritual substances are not
        joined to these lesser material bodies. Consequently, the latter are not
        governed in any way through their mediation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. Boethius says: “Through Himself alone God disposes all things.” His
        disposition of material things, therefore, does not take place through
        spirits.

        1. Gregory says: “In this visible world, nothing can be disposed except
        through invisible creatures.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Augustine writes: “All material things are ruled in a definite order
        through the spirit of life.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Augustine also says: “God does certain things Himself, as
        illuminating and beatifying souls. Other things He does through
        creatures who serve Him. These, in proportion to their merit and
        according to inviolable laws, are ordained to care even for sparrows,
        even for the beauty of the grass of the fields, indeed, even for the
        number of hairs on our heads—and to all this divine providence extends.”
        Now, the creatures ordained to serve God’s inviolable decrees are the
        angels; consequently, it is through them that He governs material
        things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Origen writes: “The world needs the angels, who rule over beasts,
        preside over the birth of animals, and over the growth of bushes,
        plants, and other things.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Hugh of St. Victor says: “The ministry of angels rules not only over
        the life of men but also over the things that are related to their
        life.” Now, all material things are ordained for men’s use.
        Consequently, all things are governed through the mediation of angels.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. In a co-ordinated series, the earlier members act on the later
        members. The later do not act on the earlier. But spiritual substances
        are prior to material, since they are closer to the first principle.
        Therefore, the action of spiritual substances governs material actions,
        and the opposite is not true.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Man is said to be a “microcosm” because the soul rules the human body
        as God rules the whole universe. In this respect, the soul is called “an
        image of God” more than angels are. Now, our soul governs the body
        through the mediation of certain spirits which are spiritual in
        comparison with the body, although material in comparison with the soul.
        Consequently, God also rules material creatures through the mediation of
        spiritual creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Our soul exercises certain operations directly, for example,
        understanding and willing; but it exercises other operations mediately
        by using bodily organs as instruments, as, for example, in the
        operations of the sensitive and vegetative soul. God also exercises
        certain operations directly, such as the beatifying of souls and the
        other actions He performs in relation to the highest substances.
        Consequently, some of God’s operations will also take place in the
        lowest substances through the mediation of the highest ones.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. The first cause does not take away the operation of a second cause,
        but, as is clear from what is said in <i>The Causes,</i> it strengthens
        it. Now, if God were to govern all things immediately, second causes
        would have no operations of their own. God, therefore, rules lower
        beings through higher beings.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. In the universe there is something, such as the ultimate
        constituents of bodies, which is ruled but does not rule. There is
        something, such as God, which is not ruled but rules. Therefore, there
        will exist something that both rules and is ruled—a medium between both
        types. Consequently, God rules lower creatures through the mediation of
        higher.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As Dionysius and Augustine say, the divine goodness is the cause of
        things’ being brought into existence, for God wished to communicate His
        goodness to others as far as this was possible to creatures. God’s
        goodness, however, has a twofold perfection. We can consider it in
        itself as it contains all perfections in itself in a supereminent way,
        or we can consider it as it flows into things, that is, as it is the
        cause of things. It was fitting, therefore, that God’s divine goodness
        should be communicated to creatures in both ways so that because of this
        goodness created things not only would exist and possess goodness but
        also would give existence and goodness to other things, just like the
        sun’s outpoured rays, which not only illumine other bodies but also make
        them to be sources of light, too. However, the following order is kept:
        Those that most resemble the sun receive the most of its light and,
        consequently, have sufficient light not only for themselves but also to
        pour out on other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Similarly, in the ordering of the universe, as a result of the
        outpouring of God’s goodness, superior creatures have not only that by
        which they are good in themselves, but also that by which they are the
        cause of goodness for other things which participate the least in God’s
        goodness. These last-named things participate in the divine goodness
        merely in order to exist—not to be the cause of other things. And this
        is the reason, as Augustine and the Philosopher say, why that which is
        active is always more noble than that which is passive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, among the superior creatures, the closest to God are those rational
        ones that exist, live and understand in the likeness of God.
        Consequently, God in His goodness gives them the power not only of
        pouring out upon other things but also of having the same manner of
        outpouring that He Himself has—that is, according to their will, and not
        according to any necessity of their nature. Hence, God governs inferior
        creatures both through spiritual creatures and through the more noble
        material creatures. He provides through material creatures, not by
        making them provident themselves, but by making them active. He governs
        through spiritual creatures, however, by making them provident
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But even in rational creatures an order can be found. Rational souls
        hold the lowest place among these, and their light is shadowy in
        comparison with that of the angels. Consequently, as Dionysius says,
        their knowledge is more restricted, and their providence is likewise
        restricted to a few things, namely, to human affairs and practical
        matters of human life. But the providence of angels is universal and
        extends to all material creation. Consequently, both saints and
        philosophers say that all corporeal things are governed by divine
        providence through the mediation of angels. We must differ with the
        philosophers, however, in this, that some of them say that corporeal
        things are not only cared for by angels but are also created by them.
        This opinion is contrary to faith. We should follow, instead, the
        opinion of the saints who hold that corporeal things of this sort are
        administered by the providence of angels through motion only; that is,
        the angels move the higher bodies, and these motions cause the motions
        of the lower.

        1. An exclusive statement regarding an agent does not exclude the
        operation of an instrument; it merely excludes another principal agent.
        Hence, if one were to say, “Socrates alone makes a knife,” not the
        operation of his hammer but only the operation of another carpenter is
        excluded. Similarly, when it is said that God governs the world by
        Himself, this does not exclude the operation of inferior causes, which
        God uses as instrumental means. All that is excluded is government by
        another principal ruler.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The governing of a thing pertains to its direction to an end. The
        ordination of a thing to an end, however, presupposes its act of
        existing; but its act of existing presupposes nothing else.
        Consequently, creation, by which all things are brought into existence,
        is the operation of the only cause that presupposes no other cause by
        which it is kept in existence. Government, however, can be one of those
        causes that do presuppose other causes, so it is not necessary for God
        to create through the mediation of certain causes through whose
        instrumentality He governs.

        3. What creatures receive from God cannot exist in them in the same
        manner in which it exists in Him. Consequently, this difference becomes
        apparent when names are applied to Him. Those names that express some
        perfection absolutely are common also to creatures; but those that
        express both a perfection and its manner of existing in God are not
        common to creatures, for example,
        <i>omnipotence, supreme wisdom,</i> and <i>supreme goodness.</i> It is
        clear, therefore, that even though supreme goodness is not communicated
        to a creature, providence can be communicated to it.

        4. Even though that establishment of nature by which material things
        receive a tendency to an end comes directly from God, their motion and
        action can take place through the instrumentality of angels, just as
        natures in seeds possess their undeveloped nature from God alone but, by
        the providence of a farmer, are helped to develop into act.
        Consequently, just as a farmer supervises the growth of the crops in his
        fields, so do angels direct the entire activity of material creation.

        5. Augustine divides the operation of natural providence from that of
        voluntary providence by considering the proximate principles of their
        operations; and nature is the proximate principle of some operations of
        divine providence, while the will is that of others. But the remote
        principle of all providential action is the will, at least the divine
        will. The argument, therefore, proves nothing.

        6. Just as all material bodies lie under God’s providence but God’s care
        is nevertheless said to be only for men because of the special kind of
        providence He has for them, so also, even though all material bodies are
        subject to the rule of angels, nevertheless, because of the dignity of
        men’s souls, angels are appointed to guard men in a very special way.

        entirely true of the wills of angels, which are perfectly conformed to

        8. As Avicenna saya, no effect can remain if its proper cause is
        removed. Now, certain inferior causes are causes of becoming; others are
        causes of existing. A cause of becoming is that which educes a form from
        the potentiality of matter by means of motion, such as a cutler who is
        the efficient cause of a knife. A cause of a thing’s existing, however,
        is that upon which the act of existence of a thing essentially depends,
        as the existence of light in the air depends upon the sun. Now, if the
        cutler is removed, the becoming of the knife ceases, but not its
        existence. However, if the sun is taken away, there ceases the very
        existence of the light in the air. Similarly, if God’s action ceases,
        the existence of a creature utterly ceases, since God is the cause not
        only of a thing’s becoming but also of its existence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. That condition cannot possibly be in a creature; that is, a creature
        cannot have an act of existence without someone keeping it in that act.
        It is repugnant to the very notion of a creature; for a creature,
        because it is a creature, has an act of existence that is caused, and,
        consequently, it depends on something else.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. More things are required for second act than for first act. Hence,
        it is not unreasonable that something should be the cause of another’s
        motion and operation, even though it is not the cause of its act of
        existence.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. The breadth of God’s providence and goodness is manifested more
        clearly in His governance of inferior beings through superior beings
        than if He were to govern all things directly. For in this kind of
        government, as is clear from what has been said, the perfection of God’s
        goodness is communicated in more than one regard.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. A spiritual creature governs a material one by giving it motion.
        This does not necessitate that spiritual creatures be joined to all
        bodies, but only to those which they move directly, namely, the first
        bodies. Spiritual creatures, moreover, are not joined to these bodies by
        being their forms, as some have held, but by being their movers.

        13. When something is said to take place through another, the
        preposition <i>through</i> implies that it is a cause of the operation.
        Now, since an operation stands halfway between the one doing the work
        and the work that is done, <i>through</i> can imply a cause of the
        operation in so far as this cause issues in a result. In this sense it
        is said that something takes place <i>through</i> an instrument.
        <i>Through</i> can also, however, signify a cause of the operation in so
        far as the operation comes from the one operating. In this sense we say
        that something takes place <i>through</i> the form of the agent. Now,
        here it is not the instrument which is the cause of the agent’s action,
        but his form or some superior agent is the cause. However, an instrument
        can be the cause of the result which receives the agent’s action.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consequently, when we read that God disposes all things through Himself
        alone, <i>through</i> denotes the cause of His divine disposition in so
        far as it comes from God who is disposing. In this sense, God is said to
        dispose through Himself alone, because He is not moved by any superior
        disposing Him; and He disposes, not through any extrinsic form, but only
        through His own goodness.

        1. Speaking of celestial bodies, Damascene writes as follows: “We say,
        however, that they do not cause generation or corruption.”’ Since bodies
        here below are subject to generation and corruption, they are
        consequently not disposed through celestial bodies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It was said, however, that the celestial bodies are not called the
        causes of bodies here below merely because they do not introduce any
        necessity into them.—On the contrary, if an effect of a heavenly body on
        bodies here below is impeded, this must have been caused by some
        condition in the lower bodies. Now, if the lower bodies are ruled by the
        heavenly bodies, then that obstructing condition must be traced to some
        influence of a heavenly body. Consequently, no impediment could arise
        from bodies here below unless it were due to an exigency of the
        celestial bodies. Therefore, if the celestial bodies rule the lower, and
        if the motions of the celestial bodies are necessary, they will
        introduce necessity into the lower bodies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. For an action to be completed, all that is needed is something active
        and something passive. Now, both active and passive natural powers are
        found in bodies here below. Therefore, no power of a celestial body is
        needed for their actions. Consequently, bodies here below are not ruled
        through the instrumentality of celestial bodies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. According to Augustine, there are three types of things: first,
        things that are acted upon but do not act (e.g., bodies); second, things
        that act but are not acted upon (e.g., God); third, things that both act
        and are acted upon (e.g., spiritual substances). Now, celestial bodies
        are simply corporeal. Consequently, they do not have the power of acting
        upon bodies here below. Hence, the latter are not disposed through their
        instrumentality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. If a celestial body acts upon bodies here below, either it acts upon
        them in so far as it is a body, that is, through its material form, or
        it acts upon them through something else. Now, a celestial body does not
        act in so far as it is a body, because this kind of action can be found
        in all bodies; and this explanation seems unlikely from what Augustine
        says. Consequently, if it does act upon lower bodies, its action is due
        to something else; and, in this case, it should be attributed to an
        immaterial power and not to the heavenly bodies. Hence, the conclusion
        is the same as before.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. What does not belong to what is prior does not belong to what is
        subsequent. Now, as the Commentator says, material forms presuppose
        indeterminate dimensions in matter. However, dimensions are not active,
        because quantity is not an active principle. Therefore, material forms
        are not active principles, and so no body can do anything except through
        an immaterial power existing within it. Consequently, the conclusion is
        the same as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Explaining this statement made in <i>The Causes,</i> “Every noble
        soul has three operations,” a Commentator declares that the soul acts on
        nature by means of a divine power existing within it. A soul, however,
        is much more noble than a body. Hence, neither can a body do anything to
        the soul except by means of a divine power within it. Consequently, our
        original position stands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. That which is more simple is not moved by what is less simple. But
        seminal principles in the matter of bodies here below are more simple
        than the material power of the heavens, because the power of the latter
        is diffused in matter while that of the seminal principles is not.
        Therefore, the seminal principles in bodies here below cannot be moved
        by the power of a celestial body. Hence, bodies here below are not
        governed in their motions by celestial bodies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Augustine writes as follows: “Nothing pertains to the body more than
        the body’s sex. Yet, twins of different sexes can be conceived when the
        stars are in the same position.” Therefore, celestial bodies have no
        influence even on material things, and our original position stands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. As we read in <i>The Causes</i>: “The first cause has more effect on
        what is caused by a second cause than the second cause itself has.” Now,
        if bodies here below are disposed by celestial bodies, then with respect
        to the powers in bodies here below the powers of the celestial bodies
        are in a relation similar to that of the first cause; and the powers in
        bodies here below are then like second causes. Hence, effects taking
        place in bodies here below are determined more by the disposition of the
        celestial spheres than they are by the powers of the bodies themselves.
        However, there is necessity in the celestial bodies, since they always
        remain the same. Therefore, their effects below will also be necessary.
        But this is not true. Consequently, the first statement—that bodies here
        below are disposed by heavenly bodies—is also not true.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        i 1. As we read in <i>The Heavens</i>, the motion of the heavens is
        natural. Consequently, it can hardly be voluntary or the result of a
        choice The things that are caused by it, therefore, are not caused as
        the result of a choice, and so do not come under providence. It would be
        unreasonable, however, to suppose that bodies here below are not
        governed by providence. Therefore, it is unreasonable for the motion of
        celestial bodies to be the cause of bodies here below.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. When a cause is placed, an effect is placed. Therefore, the act of
        existence of a cause is, as it were, antecedent to that of an effect.
        Now, if an antecedent is necessary, the consequent is also necessary.
        Therefore, if a cause is necessary, the effect is likewise necessary.
        However, the effects taking place in bodies here below are not necessary
        but contingent. Consequently, they are not caused by the motion of the
        heavens, which is necessary because natural. Therefore, our original
        position stands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. The final cause of a thing’s becoming is more noble than the thing.
        But all things were made for the sake of man—even heavenly bodies. For
        we read the following in Deuteronomy (4:19): “Lest perhaps lifting up
        thy eyes to heaven, thou see the sun and the moon, and all the stars of
        heaven, and being deceived by error thou adore them, which the Lord thy
        God created for the service of all the nations that are under heaven.”
        Therefore, man is more noble than the celestial bodies. Now, what is
        less noble does not influence what is more noble. Consequently,
        celestial bodies have no influence on a human body, and, for the same
        reason, none on other bodies such as elements that are prior to the
        human body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. It was said, however, that man is more noble than the heavenly
        bodies because of his soul, not because of his body.—On the contrary, a
        nobler perfection is proper to a nobler subject. Now, the body of a man
        has a more noble form than a heavenly body has; for the form of the
        heavens is purely material, and a rational soul is much more noble than
        matter. Therefore, even the body of a man is nobler than a heavenly
        body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. A contrary is not the cause of its contrary. Now, occasionally, the
        power of a celestial body is opposed to the introduction of certain
        effects into lower bodies. For example, sometimes a celestial body
        starts to cause dampness, while a doctor is trying to dispose of some
        matter by drying it up in order to restore health; and he often succeeds
        in doing this even though a heavenly body is exerting a contrary
        influence. Therefore, heavenly bodies do not cause physical effects in
        bodies here below.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. Since all action takes place through contact, what makes no contact
        does not act. Heavenly bodies, however, do not touch bodies here below.
        Consequently, they do not act upon them; and the original position
        stands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        17. But it was said that heavenly bodies contact lower bodies through a
        medium.—On the contrary, whenever there is contact and action through a
        medium, the medium must receive the effect of the agent before the
        end-term does. For example, fire heats the air before it heats us. Now,
        the effects of the sun and of the stars cannot be received in the lower
        spheres because these have the nature of the fifth essence and
        consequently cannot be affected by heat, cold, or any of the other
        states found in bodies here below. Therefore, no action can come from
        the heavenly bodies through the lower spheres to bodies here below.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        18. Providence is communicated to what is an instrument of providence.
        But providence cannot be communicated to heavenly bodies, since they
        lack intelligence. Therefore, they cannot be an instrument for providing
        for things.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        l. Augustine says: “Bodies with weaker and grosser natures are ruled in
        a definite order by those that are more subtle and powerful.” Now, the
        heavenly bodies are more subtle and powerful than bodies here below.
        Therefore, they rule the bodies here below.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Dionysius says that the rays of the sun “enable visible bodies to
        generate and give them life, nourishment, and growth.” Now, these are
        the more noble effects to be found in bodies here below. Consequently,
        all the other physical effects also are produced by the providence of
        God through the mediation of celestial bodies.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. According to the Philosopher, that which is first in any genus is the
        cause of the others that come afterwards in that genus. But the heavenly
        bodies are first in the genus of bodies, and their motions are first of
        all material motions. They are, therefore, the cause of material bodies
        that are moved here below. Hence, the conclusion is the same as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. According to the Philosopher, the movement of the sun along an
        inclined circle causes generation and corruption in bodies here below.
        Consequently, generations and corruptions are measured by this movement.
        Aristotle also says that all the variety found in concepts is due to the
        heavenly bodies. Therefore, bodies here below are disposed through their
        mediation.

        5. Rabbi Moses says that the heavens are in the universe as a heart is
        in an animal. But all the other members are ruled by the soul through
        the instrumentality of the heart. Therefore, all material things are
        ruled by God through the instrumentality of the heavens.

        The common intention of all philosophers was to reduce multitude to
        unity and variety to uniformity as much as possible. Consequently, after
        considering the diversity of actions to be found in bodies here below,
        the ancient philosophers attempted to reduce these bodies to some fewer
        and more simple principles, that is, to elements, one or many, and to
        elementary qualities. But their position is not logical; for, in the
        actions of natural things, elementary qualities are like instrumental
        principles. An indication of this is the fact that they do not have the
        same way of acting in all things, nor do their actions always arrive at
        the same term. They have different effects in gold, in wood, and in the
        flesh of an animal. Now, this would not happen unless their actions were
        controlled by something else. Moreover, the action of the principal
        agent is not reduced to the action of an instrument as to its principle.
        Rather, the opposite is true, as, for example, a product of handicraft
        ought not be attributed to the saw but to the craftsman. Therefore,
        neither can natural effects be reduced to elementary qualities as to
        their first principles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consequently, others (the Patonists) made simple and separated forms the
        first principles of natural effects. These were the origin, they said,
        of the existence, genera on, and every natural property of bodies here
        below. This opinion also, however, is false; for, if a cause remains
        always the same, then the effect is always the same. Now, the forms they
        posited were immovable. Consequently, any generation resulting from them
        would always have to happen in bodies here below in a constant manner.
        But we see with our own eyes that what happens is quite the contrary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is therefore necessary to say that in bodies here below the
        principles of generation, of corruption, and of the other motions that
        depend upon these do not always remain the same; but they nevertheless
        always remain as the first principles of generation, and thereby make
        continual generation possible. Moreover, they must be unchangeable in
        their substance, and subject only to local motion. Consequently, as a
        result of their approach or withdrawal, they bring about diverse and
        contrary motions in bodies here below. Now, the heavenly bodies are of
        just such a nature. Consequently, all material effects should be reduced
        to them as to their cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In this reduction, however, two errors have been made. Some have reduced
        the bodies here below to heavenly bodies, as though the latter were
        their absolute first cause, for these philosophers denied that
        immaterial substances exist. Consequently, they said that what is prior
        among bodies is first among beings. This, however, is clearly false.
        Whatever is moved must be reduced to a first immovable principle, since
        nothing is moved by itself, and one cannot keep going back into
        infinity. Now, even though a heavenly body does not undergo change by
        generation or corruption or by a motion which would alter what belongs
        to its substance, it is nevertheless moved locally. Consequently, the
        reduction must be made to some prior principle so that things undergoing
        qualitative change are traced back by a definite order to that which
        causes this change in other things but is not so changed itself,
        although it is moved locally; and then further back to that which does
        not change in any way at all.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Others have asserted that the heavenly bodies cause not only the motion
        of bodies here below but also their very beginning. For example,
        Avicenna says that, as a result of what is common to all heavenly
        bodies, that is, their circular motion, there is caused the common
        element of bodies here below, namely, first matter; and, as a result of
        those things which differentiate one heavenly body from another, there
        is caused the difference in their forms. Thus, the heavenly bodies are
        media, to some extent, between God and things here below even in the
        line of creation. This position, however, is contrary to faith, which
        teaches that the whole of nature in its first beginning was created
        directly by God. But that one creature should be moved by another,
        presupposing that natural powers of each creature are given it as a
        result of God’s work, is not contrary to faith. Consequently, we say
        that the heavenly bodies are the causes of bodies here below merely in
        the line of motion. Thus, these heavenly bodies are instruments in the
        work of governing, but not in the work of creating.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Damascene intends to exclude from heavenly bodies only first
        causality or any causality which would introduce necessity into bodies
        here below. For, even if heavenly bodies always act in the same way,
        their effects are received in lower bodies according to the manner of
        these lower bodies, which are frequently seen to be in a contrary state.
        Consequently, the forces exercised by the heavenly bodies are not always
        able to bring about their effects in the bodies here below, because a
        contrary disposition prevents them from doing so. This is why the
        Philosopher says that signs of storms and winds frequently appear, but
        the storms and winds do not take place because the contrary dispositions
        are stronger.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Those dispositions that resist the force of the celestial bodies are
        caused in their original creation, not by a heavenly body, but by God’s
        operation, which has made fire to be hot, water to be cold, and so
        forth. Consequently, we should not reduce all impediments of this kind
        to the celestial bodies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The active powers in these lower bodies are merely instrumental.
        Consequently, like an instrument which does not move unless it is moved
        by a first agent, the active powers of inferior bodies cannot operate
        unless moved by celestial bodies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. That objection touches a certain opinion found in
        <i>The Fount of Life</i> to the effect that no body acts because of any
        power that it has as a body, because the quantity found in matter
        prevents the form from acting. Hence, every action we attribute to a
        body is really the action of some spiritual power operating in it.
        According to Rabbi Moses, this opinion was held by certain teachers
        among the Moors who said that fire does not heat, but God heats in the
        fire. This position, however, is foolish, since it denies all things
        their natural operations. Moreover, it is contrary to what philosophers
        and saints have said. Consequently, we say that bodies act by means of
        their material power; nevertheless, God operates in all things as a
        first cause operating in a second cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, the statement made to the effect that bodies are only acted
        upon but do not act should be understood in this sense: only that is
        said to act which has dominion over its action. It was in this sense
        that Damascene asserted: “Brute animals do not act but are only acted
        upon.” But this does not mean that animals do not act if act is taken to
        mean simply the performance of an action.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. As we read in <i>Generation and Corruption</i>, that which is active
        is always other than or contrary to that which is passive. Consequently,
        it does not belong to a body to act upon another body with respect to
        that which it has in common with that body, but only with respect to
        that in which it is different from it. A body, therefore, does not act
        in so far as it is a body, but in so far as it is a certain kind of
        body. For example, no animal reasons inasmuch as it is simply animal,
        but some animals reason inasmuch as they are also men. Similarly, fire
        does not heat in so far as it is a body, but in so far as it is hot. The
        same is true of a celestial body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Before the advent of natural forms, dimensions are presupposed as
        existing in matter in a state of incomplete act, not of complete act.
        Consequently, they are first in the line of matter and of generation.
        Form, however, is first in the line of completion. Now, a thing acts in
        so far as it is completed and is an actual being, not in so far as it is
        in potency. As a being in potency it is merely passive. Hence, it does
        not follow from the fact that matter or dimensions pre-existing in
        matter are not active that form is likewise inactive. Instead, the
        opposite follows. It would follow, however, if these dimensions were not
        passive, that the form would not be passive. But, as the Commentator
        says, the form of a heavenly body is not in it through the mediation of
        dimensions of the sort described.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The order of effects should correspond to the order of causes.
        According to the author of that book, however, the following order of
        causes exists: first, the first cause, God; second, the intelligence;
        third, the soul. Consequently, the first effect, the act of existence,
        is properly attributed to the first cause; the second effect, knowing,
        is attributed to intelligence; the third effect, moving, is attributed
        to the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A second cause, however, always acts in virtue of the first cause, and,
        consequently, possesses something of its operation (like the lower
        spheres which possess something of the motion of the highest). According
        to the author, however, the intelligence not only knows but also gives
        existence; and the soul, which he holds to be caused by the
        intelligence, has not only the motion of the soul, which is to move, but
        also that of an intellect, which is to understand, and that of God,
        which is to give existence. I admit these to be the actions of a noble
        soul, but he understands such a soul to be the soul of a heavenly body
        or any other rational soul whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, it is not necessary that the divine power be the only one to
        move all things without any intermediary. The lower causes can also move
        through their own powers in so far as they participate in the power of
        superior causes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. According to Augustine, seminal principles are all the active and
        passive powers given to creatures by God; and through their
        instrumentality natural effects are brought into existence. He writes in
        <i>The Trinity</i>: “Like a mother pregnant with her unborn infant, the
        world is pregnant with the causes of unborn things.” While explaining
        what he said above about seminal principles, he also called them “the
        powers and faculties” that are allotted to things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consequently, included in these seminal principles are the active powers
        of celestial bodies, which are more noble than the active powers of
        bodies here below and, consequently, able to move them. They are called
        seminal principles inasmuch as all effects are originally in their
        active causes in the manner of seeds. But if, as some hold, seminal
        principles are understood as being the beginnings of forms in first
        matter, inasmuch as first matter is in potency to all forms, then, even
        though this does not agree very much with the words of Augustine, it can
        be said that the simplicity of these principles, like the simplicity of
        first matter, is caused by their imperfection, and, because of it, they
        cannot be moved, just as first matter cannot be.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Differentiation of the sexes must be attributed to celestial causes.
        Our reason for saying this is as follows: Every agent tends to form to
        its own likeness, as far as possible, that which is passive in its
        respect. Accordingly, the active principle in the male seed always tends
        toward the generation of a male offspring, which is more perfect than
        the female. From this it follows that conception of female offspring is
        something of an accident in the order of nature-in so far, at least, as
        it is not the result of the natural causality of the particular agent.
        Therefore, if there were no other natural influence at work tending
        toward the conception of female offspring, such conception would be
        wholly outside the design of nature, as is the case with what we call
        “monstrous” births. And so it is said that, although the conception of
        female offspring is not the natural result of the efficient causality of
        the particular nature at work—for which reason the female is sometimes
        spoken of as an “accidental male”—nevertheless, the conception of female
        offspring is the natural result of universal nature; that is, it is due
        to the influence of a heavenly body, as Avicenna suggests.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Matter, however, can cause an impediment which will prevent both the
        celestial force and the particular nature from attaining their effect,
        namely, the production of a male. And so, sometimes, as a result of an
        improper disposition in matter, a female is conceived even when the
        celestial influence tends to the contrary; or the opposite may happen,
        and, despite the influence of the celestial body, a male will sometimes
        be conceived because the formative influence of the particular agent is
        strong enough to overcome the defect in the material. In the conception
        of twins, the matter is separated by the operation of nature; and one
        part of the matter yields to the active principle more than the other
        part does because of the latter’s deficiency. Consequently, in one part
        a female is generated, in the other, a male—independently of the
        dispositions of the celestial spheres one way or the other. The
        generation of a female twin, however, happens more often when a
        celestial body disposes to the female sex.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. A first cause is said to have more influence than a second cause in
        so far as its effect is deeper and more permanent in what is caused than
        the effect of the second cause is. Nevertheless, the effect has more
        resemblance to the second cause, since the action of the first cause is
        in some way determined to this particular effect by means of the second
        cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Although a movement in the heavens, as it is the act of a movable
        body, is not a voluntary motion, nevertheless, as it is the act of a
        mover, it is voluntary; that is to say, it is caused by a will. And in
        this respect the things which are caused by this movement may come under
        providence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. An effect does not follow from a first cause unless the second cause
        has already been placed. Consequently, the necessity of a first cause
        does not introduce necessity into its effect unless the second cause is
        also necessary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. The celestial bodies are not made for man in the sense that man is
        their principal end. Their principal end is the divine goodness.
        Moreover, that man is nobler than a heavenly body is not due to the
        nature of his body but to the nature of his rational soul. Besides, even
        granting that man’s body were, speaking absolutely, nobler than a
        celestial body, this would not prevent a celestial body from being
        nobler than a human body under a certain aspect, namely, as it has
        active power while the latter has merely passive power; and in this
        respect, a celestial body can act upon the human body. Similarly, fire
        as it is actually hot can act upon a human body in so far as the latter
        is potentially hot.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. The rational soul is a substance as well as the act of a body. As a
        substance, therefore, it is nobler than the form of a celestial body;
        but it is not nobler as the act of a body. Or it could be said that the
        soul is a perfection of the human body both as a form and as a mover.
        But, since a celestial body is more perfect, it does not need a
        spiritual substance to perfect it as a form, but only to perfect it as a
        mover. This self-sufficiency makes it naturally more noble than [man who
        needs] a human soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Even though some have asserted that the movers of the heavenly spheres
        are joined to them as forms, Augustine left the matter in doubt. In his
        commentary on the words of Ecclesiastes (1:6), “The spirit goeth forward
        surveying all places round about,” Jerome seems to follow the
        affirmative position; for he says: “He calls the sun a spirit because it
        breathes and lives like an animal.” Damascene, however, holds the
        contrary: “Let no one think that the heavens or the stars are living.
        They lack both life and feeling.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. Even the action of a contrary which resists the active influence of
        a celestial body has some cause in the heavens; for, as the philosophers
        say, things here below are sustained in their actions by the first
        motion. Consequently, a contrary whose action impedes the effect of a
        celestial body, like the hot remedy which impedes moistening by the
        moon, nevertheless has a cause in the heavens. Similarly, the health
        that follows is not entirely contrary to the action of the celestial
        body but has some roots there.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. As is said in <i>Generation and Corruption</i>, heavenly bodies
        contact bodies here below, but are not contacted by them. Moreover, as
        was mentioned, no heavenly body immediately contacts a body here below.
        The contact is through a medium.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        17. The action of the agent is received in the medium according to the
        manner of the medium. Consequently, it is sometimes received in a
        different way in the medium than in the ultimate term. For example, the
        force of a magnet attracting iron passes to the iron through the medium
        of air, which is not attracted; and, as the Commentator says, the force
        of a fish that shocks the hand is transmitted to the hand through a net
        which is not shocked. Moreover, heavenly bodies do have all the
        qualities found in bodies below, but in their own way (which is that of
        a source) and not as in these lower bodies. Consequently, their actions
        are not received in the intermediate spheres in such a way that these
        are changed as the lower bodies are.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        18. Bodies f this kind here below are ruled by divine providence through
        the h her bodies, but not in such a way that divine providence is
        communicated to them. They are made merely the instruments by which
        God’s providence is carried out—just as art is not communicated to a
        hammer, which is merely an instrument of the art.

        It seems that they are, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. According to Damascene, heavenly bodies “are responsible for our
        habits, temperament, and disposition.” Now, habits and dispositions
        belong to the intellect and the will, which are the principles of human
        acts. Consequently, human acts are disposed by God through the mediation
        of celestial bodies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. We read in <i>The Six Principles</i>: That the soul when joined to a
        body, imitates the temperament of that body. But, since the celestial
        bodies leave their impression on a man’s temperament, they thereby
        influence his soul. Hence, they can cause human acts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Whatever acts upon a prior member of a series also acts upon a
        subsequent member. Now, the essence of the soul exists before its powers
        of intellect and will exist, because these have their origin in the
        essence of the soul. Therefore, since the celestial bodies leave their
        impression on the essence of the rational soul, which they do inasmuch
        as the soul is the act of a body—a function belonging to it by its very
        essence, it seems that they leave their impression on the intellect and
        will, and, consequently, are principles of human acts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. An instrument acts, not only because of its own power, but also
        because of the power of the principal agent. Now, since a heavenly body
        is a moved mover, it is the instrument of the spiritual substance moving
        it. Consequently, its motion is not that of a body alone but it is also
        the act of the spirit moving it. Therefore, its motion takes place, not
        only by reason of the body moved, but also by reason of the spirit
        moving it. Now, just as that celestial body is superior to a human body,
        so is that spiritual substance superior to a human spirit. Consequently,
        that motion leaves its impression on a man’s soul as well as on his
        body. It seems, therefore, that they are the principles of his acts of
        intellect and will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. By experience we know that from their birth some men have talents for
        learning or exercising certain crafts. Hence, some become carpenters,
        others become doctors, and so forth. Now, this proclivity cannot be
        reduced to the proximate principles of generation as its cause, for
        children are often found to have a bent to certain things which their
        parents did not have. This difference in talent, therefore, should be
        reduced to the celestial bodies as its cause. Moreover, it cannot be
        said that this sort of talent is in men’s souls through the mediation of
        their bodies, because the physical qualities of the body do not
        contribute to these inclinations as they actually do to anger, joy, and
        similar passions of the soul. Celestial bodies, therefore, leave their
        impression on men’s souls immediately and directly. Consequently, human
        acts are disposed through the instrumentality of the celestial bodies.

        6. Of all human acts, the following seem to be superior to all others:
        ruling, waging wars, and similar actions. But, as Isaac says: “God made
        a sphere to rule over kingdoms and wars.” Much more, then, are other
        human acts disposed through the mediation of heavenly bodies.

        7. It is easier to transfer a part than a whole. But, according to
        philosophers, the influence of the celestial bodies sometimes moves the
        entire population of a province to launch a war. Much more, then, can
        the power of these celestial bodies affect some particular man.

        1. Damascene writes of the heavenly bodies that they never cause our

        To get a clear understanding of this question, we must first understand
        what is meant by <i>human acts.</i> Human acts, properly speaking, are
        those over which a man is master. A man, however, is the master of his
        acts through his will or free choice. Consequently, this question is
        concerned with the acts of the will and of free choice. There are, of
        course, other acts in man that do not lie under the command of his will,
        for example, the acts of his nutritive and generative powers. These acts
        lie under the influence of celestial forces, just as other physical acts
        do.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There have been many errors regarding human acts. Some have said that
        human acts do not come under God’s providence and cannot be reduced to
        any cause other than our own providence. As Augustine says, this seems
        to have been the position of Cicero. The position, however, is
        untenable; for, as proved in <i>The Soul</i>, our will is a moved mover.
        Consequently, its act must be reduced to some first principle that is an
        unmoved mover.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For this reason, some have reduced all the acts of the will to the
        celestial bodies; for, since they asserted that our senses and intellect
        are the same, it followed that all the powers of the soul are material
        and, therefore, subject to the action of the heavenly bodies. The
        Philosopher, however, destroys this position by showing that the
        intellect is an immaterial power and that its action is not material. As
        he says in <i>The Generation of Animals</i>, if the actions of
        principles are immaterial, the principles themselves must be immaterial.
        Consequently, it is impossible for the actions of the will and intellect
        of themselves to be reduced to any material principles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Avicenna, therefore, declared that heavenly bodies were made, like man,
        of a soul and body, and that, just as the actions and motion of a human
        body are reduced to celestial bodies, so all the actions of the soul are
        reduced to celestial souls as to their principles. Consequently,
        whatever will we have is caused by the will of a celestial soul. This
        position is consistent with his opinion on the end of man, which he
        holds to be the union of the human soul with a celestial soul or
        intelligence. For, since the perfection of the will is its end and its
        good—and this is its object, just as the visible is the object of
        sight—then that which acts upon the will should have the nature of an
        end, because an efficient cause acts only in so far as it impresses its
        form on a recipient.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Faith, however, teaches that God is the direct end of man’s life, and
        that we will be beatified and enjoy the vision of God. Consequently, He
        alone can leave an impression on our will. Now, the order of what is
        moved should correspond to the order of the movers. But in our
        ordination to our end, with which providence is concerned, the first
        thing that is in us is our will; and the characters of the good and of
        an end primarily pertain to the will, which uses everything we have as
        instruments toward achieving our end. However, in a certain respect the
        intellect precedes the will, and is, moreover, more closely related to
        it than our bodily powers are. Consequently, God alone, who is the first
        provider in all respects, leaves His imprint on our will; the angels,
        who follow Him in the order of causes, leave their imprint on our
        intellect in so far as we are enlightened, cleansed, and perfected by
        them, as Dionysius says. But the celestial bodies, which are inferior
        agents, can leave their imprint only upon our sensible powers and the
        other powers in our organs. Of course, inasmuch as the movement of one
        power of the soul flows over into another, it happens that the
        impression made by a celestial body will, as it were, accidentally flow
        over into the intellect and finally into the will. Similarly, the
        impression made by an angel upon our intellect also accidentally flows
        over into our will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But the relation of the intellect and of the will to the sensitive
        powers is different in the following respect: the intellect is naturally
        moved by the sensitive apprehension in the way in which a potency is
        moved by an object, because, as is said in <i>The Soul</i>, the phantasm
        is related to the possible intellect as color is to sight. Consequently,
        whenever an interior sensitive power is disturbed, the intellect is
        necessarily also disturbed. We see, for example, that when the organ of
        the imagination is injured the action of the intellect is necessarily
        impeded. By this means, therefore, the action or influence of a
        celestial body can flow over into the intellect with a kind of
        necessity; but this influence is accidental, because what it directly
        influences is the body. I say Itneccssity” flows over—unless there is a
        contrary disposition in what is affected. But the sensitive appetite is
        not the natural mover of the will. Instead, the opposite is true,
        because, as is said in <i>The Soul</i>, a higher appetite moves a lower
        “as one sphere” moves another. And no matter how much a lower appetite
        is troubled by the passion, as of anger or of concupiscence, the will
        need not be disturbed. Indeed, the will has the power to repel a
        disturbance of this kind; for, as we read in Genesis (4:7): “The lust
        thereof shall be under thee.” Consequently, no necessity is introduced
        into human acts by the influence of celestial bodies, either by the
        celestial bodies themselves or by those things which receive their
        influence. The celestial bodies introduce only an inclination, which the
        will can resist by means of an acquired or infused power.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Damascene is thinking of bodily habits and dispositions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. From what was said above, it is clear that an act of the will in the
        soul does not necessarily follow the disposition of the body. From the
        temperament of the body, only an inclination arises to those things
        which are the object of the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That argument would proceed correctly if a heavenly body could leave
        its impression on the essence of the soul directly. But the influence of
        a heavenly body reaches to the essence of the soul only indirectly, that
        is, only in so far as the soul is united to a body, whose act the soul
        is. The will, however, does not have its origin in the essence of the
        soul in so far as the soul is joined to a body. Consequently, the
        argument proves nothing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. An instrument of a spiritual agent acts through a spiritual power
        only as it acts through its own material power. Because of its material
        power, however, a heavenly body can act upon our bodies only.
        Consequently, the action that arises from its spiritual power can arrive
        at the soul only indirectly, that is, through the mediation of man’s
        body. However, the material and spiritual power of a heavenly body can
        influence man’s body directly. Because of its material power it moves
        elementary qualities, such as hot, cold, and so forth; and because of
        its spiritual power it moves to species and to those effects following
        the entire species which cannot be reduced to elementary qualities.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. There are in those bodies some effects of the heavenly bodies which
        are not caused by heat or cold, such as the attraction of iron by a
        magnet. In this way some disposition is left in a human body by a
        celestial body; and by reason of this disposition the soul that is
        joined to such a body is inclined to this or that craft.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. If we must “save” the words of Isaac, we have to understand them to
        mean merely an inclination in the manner described above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. For the most part, a large group follows its natural inclinations,
        for, as members of a group, men give in to the passions of the group.
        But by using their intelligence wise men overcome these passions and
        inclinations. Consequently, it is more probable that a large group will
        do what a celestial body inclines it to do than that one individual
        will; for he may use his reason to overcome this inclination. Similarly,
        if there is a large group of hot-tempered men, it is unlikely that they
        will not be angered, although it is more likely that an individual will
        not.
