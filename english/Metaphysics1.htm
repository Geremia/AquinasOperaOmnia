        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 1: 980a 21-983a 3
      </p>
      <p>
        1. All men naturally desire to know. A sign of this is the delight we
        take in the senses; for apart from their usefulness they are loved for
        themselves, and most of all the sense which operates through the eyes.
        For not only that we may act, but even when we intend to do nothing, we
        prefer sight, as we may say, to all the other senses. The reason is that
        of all the senses this most enables us to know and reveals many
        differences between things.
      </p>
      <p>2. Animals by nature, then, are born with sensory power.</p>
      <p>
        3. Now in some animals memory arises from the senses, but in others it
        does not; and for this reason the former are prudent and more capable of
        being taught than those which are unable to remember. Those which cannot
        hear sounds are prudent but unable to learn, as the bee and any other
        similar type of animal there may be. But any which have this sense
        together with memory are able to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Thus other animals live by imagination and memory and share little in
        experience, whereas the human race lives by art and reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Now in men experience comes from memory, for many memories of the
        same thing produce the capacity of a single experience. And experience
        seems to be somewhat like science and art.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. But in men science and art come from experience; for “Experience
        causes art, and inexperience, luck,” as Polus rightly states. Art comes
        into being when from many conceptions acquired by experience a Single
        universal judgment is formed about similar things. For to judge that
        this [medicine] has been beneficial to Callias and Socrates and many
        other individuals who suffer from this disease, is a matter of
        experience; but to judge that it has been beneficial to all individuals
        f a particular kind, as the phlegmatic, the bilious, or the feverish,
        taken as a lass, who suffer from this disease, is a matter of art.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. In practical matters, then, experience seems to differ in no way from
        art. ut we see that men of experience are more proficient than those who
        have theory without experience. The reason is that experience is a
        knowledge of in singulars, whereas art is a knowledge of universals. But
        all actions and processes of generation are concerned with singulars.
        For the physician heals man only incidentally, but he heals Socrates or
        Callias, or some individual that can be named, to whom the nature man
        happens to belong. Therefore, if anyone has the theory without
        experience, and knows the universal but not the singulars contained in
        this, he will very often make mistakes; for it is rather the individual
        man who is able to be cured.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. Yet we think that scientific knowledge and the ability to refute
        objections belong to art rather than to experience, and we are of the
        opinion that those who are proficient in art are wiser than men of
        experience, implying that it is more according to wisdom to know as one
        pursuing all things.
      </p>
      <p>
        9. Now this is because the former know the cause whereas the latter do
        not. For those who have experience know that something is so but do not
        know why, whereas the others know the why and the cause. For this
        reason, too, we think that the master planners in each art are to be
        held in greater esteem, and that they know more and are wiser than the
        manual laborers, because they understand the reasons for the things
        which are done. Indeed, we think that the latter resemble certain
        inanimate things, which act but do not know what they do, as fire burns.
        Therefore inanimate things perform each of their actions as a result of
        a certain natural disposition, whereas manual laborers perform theirs
        through habit, implying that some men are wiser not insofar as they are
        practical but insofar as they themselves have the theories and know the
        causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. In general a sign, of scientific knowledge is the ability to teach,
        and for this reason we think that art rather than experience is science.
        For those who have an art are able to teach, whereas the others are not.
      </p>
      <p>
        11. Furthermore, we do not hold that any one of the senses is wisdom,
        since the cognition of singular things belongs especially to the senses.
        However, these do not tell us why a thing is so; for example, they do
        not tell us why fire is hot but only that it is so.
      </p>
      <p>
        12 It is only fitting, then, that the one who discovered any art
        whatsoever that went beyond the common perceptions of men should be
        admired by men, not only because of some usefulness of his discoveries,
        but as one who is wise and as distinguishing [a thing] from others. And
        as more of the arts were discovered, some to supply the necessities of
        life, and others to introduce us [to the sciences], those who discovered
        the former were always considered to be wiser than those who discovered
        the former, because their sciences were not for the sake of utility.
        Hence, after all such arts had already been developed, those sciences
        were discovered which are pursued neither for the sake of pleasure nor
        necessity. This happened first in those places where men had leisure.
        Hence the mathematical arts originated in Egypt, for there the priestly
        class was permitted leisure. The difference between art and science and
        similar mental states has been stated in our work on morals.
      </p>
      <p>
        13. Now the reason for undertaking this investigation is that all men
        think that the science which is called wisdom deals with the primary
        causes and principles of things. Hence, as we have said before (8, 9),
        the man of experience is considered to be wiser than one who has any of
        the senses; the artist wiser than the man of experience; the master
        planner wiser than the manual laborer and speculative knowledge wiser
        than practical knowledge. It is quite evident then, that wisdom is a
        science of certain causes and principles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Three reasons why people naturally desire to know</i></p>
      <p>
        1. Aristotle first sets down an introduction to this science, in which
        he treats of two things. First (2), he points out with what this science
        is concerned. Second (53), he explains what kind of science it is (“That
        this is not a practical science”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows that the
        office of this science, which is called wisdom, is to consider the
        causes of things. Second (36), he explains with what causes or kinds of
        causes it is concerned (“But since we are in search”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he prefaces certain preliminary considerations
        form which he argues in support of his thesis. Second (35), he draws a
        conclusion from these considerations (“Now the reason for undertaking”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he makes clear the
        dignity of scientific knowledge in general. Second (9), he explains the
        hierarchy in knowing (“Animals by nature”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now he establishes the dignity of scientific knowledge from the fact
        that it is naturally desired as an end by all men. Hence, in regard to
        this he does two things. First, he states what he intends [to prove].
        Second (1), he proves it (“A sign of this”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, he says, first, that the desire to know belongs by nature
        to all men.
      </p>
      <p>2. Three reasons can be given for this:</p>
      <p>
        The first is that each thing naturally desires its own perfection. Hence
        matter is also said to desire form as any imperfect thing desires its
        perfection. Therefore, since the intellect, by which man is what he is,
        considered in itself is all things potentially, and becomes them
        actually only through knowledge, because the intellect is none of the
        things that exist before it understands them, as is stated in Book III
        of <i>The Soul</i>, so each man naturally desires knowledge just as
        matter desires form.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. The second reason is that each thing has a natural inclination to
        perform its proper operation, as something hot is naturally inclined to
        heat, and something heavy to be moved downwards. Now the proper
        operation of man as man is to understand, for by reason of this he
        differs from all other things. Hence the desire of man is naturally
        inclined to understand, and therefore to possess scientific knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. The third reason is that it is desirable for each thing to be united
        to its source, since it is in this that the perfection of each thing
        consists. This is also the reason why circular motion is the most
        perfect motion, as is proved in Book VIII of the <i>Physics</i>, because
        its terminus is united to its starting-point. Now it is only by means of
        his intellect that man is united to the separate substances, which are
        the source of the human intellect and that to which the human intellect
        is related as something imperfect to something perfect. It is for this
        reason, too, that the ultimate happiness of man consists in this union.
        Therefore man naturally desires to know. The fact that some men do not
        devote any study to this science does not disprove this thesis; for
        those who desire some end are often prevented from pursuing it for some
        reason or other, either because of the difficulty of attaining it, or
        because of other occupations. And in this way, too, even though all men
        desire knowledge, still not all devote themselves to the pursuit of it
        because they are held back by other things, either by pleasures or the
        needs of the present life; or they may even avoid the effort that
        learning demands because they are lazy. Now Aristotle makes this
        statement in order to show that it is not pointless to search for a
        science that is not useful for anything else, as happens in the case of
        this science, since a natural desire cannot exist in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Then he establishes his thesis by means of an example. Since our
        senses serve us in two respects: in knowing things and in meeting the
        needs of life, we love them for themselves inasmuch as they enable us to
        know and also assist us to live. This is evident from the fact that all
        men take the greatest delight in that sense which. is most knowing,
        i.e., the sense of sight, which we value not merely in order to do
        something, but even when we are not required to act at all. The reason
        is that this sense—that of sight—is the most knowing of all our senses
        and makes us aware of many differences between things.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. In this part it is clear that he gives two reasons why sight is
        superior to the other senses in knowing. The first is that it knows in a
        more perfect way; and this belongs to it because it is the most
        spiritual of all the senses. For the more immaterial a power is, the
        more perfectly it knows. And evidently sight is a more immaterial sense,
        if we consider the modification produced in it by its object. For all
        other sensible objects change both the organ and medium of a sense by a
        material modification, for example, the object of touch by heating and
        cooling, the object of taste by affecting the organ of taste with some
        flavor through the medium of saliva, the object of hearing by means of
        motion in the body, and the object of smell by means of the evaporation
        of volatile elements. But the object of sight changes the organ and
        medium of sight only by a spiritual modification; because neither the
        pupil of the eye nor the air becomes colored, but these only receive the
        form of color in a spiritual mode of being. Therefore, because actual
        sensation consists in the actual modification of a sense by its object,
        it is evident that that sense which is changed in a more immaterial and
        spiritual way is more spiritual in its operation. Hence sight judges
        about sensible objects in a more certain and perfect way than the other
        senses do.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. The other reason which he gives for the superiority of sight is that
        it gives us more information about things. This is attributable to the
        nature of its object, for touch and taste, and likewise smell and
        hearing, perceive those accidents by which lower bodies are
        distinguished from higher ones. But sight perceives those accidents
        which lower bodies have in common with higher ones. For a thing is
        actually visible by means of light, which is common both to lower and
        higher bodies, as is said in Book II of The Soul. Hence the celestial
        bodies are perceptible only by means of sight.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. There is also another reason. Sight informs us of many differences
        between things, for we seem to know sensible things best by means of
        sight and touch, but especially by means of sight. The reason for this
        can be drawn from the fact that the other three senses perceive those
        accidents which in a way flow from a sensible body and do not remain in
        it. Thus sound comes from a sensible body inasmuch as it flows away from
        it and does not remain in it. The same thing is true of the evaporation
        of volatile elements, with which and by which odor is diffused. But
        sight and touch perceive those accidents which remain in sensible
        bodies, such as color, warmth and coldness. Hence the judgment of sight
        and touch is extended to things themselves, whereas the judgment of
        hearing and smell is extended to those accidents which flow from things
        and not to things themselves. It is for this reason that figure and size
        and the like, by which a sensible being itself is disposed, are
        perceived more by sight and touch than by the other senses. And they are
        perceived more by sight than by touch, both because sight knows more
        efficaciously, as has been pointed out (C 6), and also because quantity
        and those [accidents] which naturally follow from it, which are seen to
        be the common sensibles, are more closely related to the object of sight
        than to that of touch. This is clear from the fact that the object of
        sight belongs in some degree to every body having some quantity, whereas
        the object of touch does not.

        9. <span style="font-weight: bold">Animals by nature, then</span> (2).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he considers the hierarchy in knowledge. He does this, first (9),
        with respect to brute animals; and, then (14), with respect to men
        (“Thus other animals”).
      </p>
      <p>
        With respect to brute animals he mentions first what all animals have in
        common; and second (10), that by which they differ and surpass one
        another (“Now in some animals”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now all animals are alike in the respect that they possess by nature the
        power of sensation. For an animal is an animal by reason of the fact
        that it has a sentient soul, which is the nature of an animal in the
        sense in which the distinctive form of each thing is its nature. But
        even though all animals are naturally endowed with sensory power, not
        all animals have all the senses, but only perfect animals. All have the
        sense of touch, for this sense in a way is the basis of all the other
        senses. However, not all have the sense of sight, because this sense
        knows in a more perfect way than all the other senses. But touch is more
        necessary; for it perceives the elements of which an animal is composed,
        namely, the hot, cold, moist and dry. Hence, just as sight knows in a
        more perfect way than the other senses, in a similar way touch is more
        necessary inasmuch as it is the first to exist in the process of
        generation. For those things which are more perfect according to this
        process come later in the development of the individual which is moved
        from a state of imperfection to one of perfection.
      </p>
      <p>10. <b>Now in some animals</b> (3).</p>
      <p>
        Here he indicates the different kinds and three levels of knowing found
        among brute animals. For there are certain animals which have sensation,
        although they do not have memory which comes from sensation. For memory
        accompanies imagination, which is a movement caused by the senses in
        their act of sensing, as we find in Book II of <i>The Soul</i>. But in
        some animals imagination does not accompany sensation, and therefore
        memory cannot exist in them. This is found verified in imperfect animals
        which are incapable of local motion, such as shellfish. For since
        sensory cognition enables animals to make provision for the necessities
        of life and to perform their characteristic operations, then those
        animals which move towards something at a distance by means of local
        motion must have memory. For if the anticipated goal by which they are
        induced to move did not remain in them through memory, they could not
        continue to move toward the intended goal which they pursue. But in the
        case of immobile animals the reception of a present sensible quality is
        sufficient for them to perform their characteristic operations, since
        they do not move toward anything at a distance. Hence these animals have
        an indefinite movement as a result of confused [or indeterminate]
        imagination alone, as he points out in Book III of <i>The Soul</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        11. Again, from the fact that some animals have memory and some do not,
        it follows that some are prudent and some not. For, since prudence makes
        provision for the future from memory of the past (and this is the reason
        why Tully in his <i>Rhetoric</i>, Book II, makes memory, understanding
        and foresight parts of prudence), prudence cannot be had by those
        animals which lack memory. Now those animals which have memory can have
        some prudence, although prudence has one meaning in the case of brute
        animals and another in the case of man. Men are prudent inasmuch as they
        deliberate rationally about what they ought to do. Hence it is saidin
        Book VI of the <i>Ethics</i>, that prudence is a rationally regulated
        plan of things to be done. But the judgment about things to be done
        which is not a result of any rational deliberation but of some natural
        instinct is called prudence in other animals. Hence in other animals
        prudence is a natural estimate about the pursuit of what is fitting and
        the avoidance of what is harmful, as a lamb follows its mother and runs
        away from a wolf.
      </p>
      <p>
        12. But among those animals which have memory some have hearing and some
        do not. And all those which cannot hear (as the bee or any other similar
        type of animal that may exist), even though they have prudence, are
        still incapable of being taught, i.e., in the sense that they can be
        habituated to the doing or avoiding of something through someone else’s
        instruction, because such instruction is received chiefly by means of
        hearing. Hence in <i>The Senses and Their Objects</i> it is stated that
        hearing is the sense by which we receive instruction. Furthermore, the
        statement that bees do not have hearing is not opposed in any way to the
        observation that they are frightened by certain sounds. For just as a
        very loud sound kills an animal and splits wood, as is evident in the
        case of thunder, not because of the sound but because of the violent
        motion of the air in which the sound is present, in a similar fashion
        those animals which lack hearing can be frightened by the sounding air
        even though they have no perception of sound. However, those animals
        which have both memory and hearing can be both prudent and teachable.
      </p>
      <p>
        13. It is evident, then, that there are three levels of knowing in
        animals. The first level is that had by animals which have neither
        hearing nor memory, and which are therefore neither capable of being
        taught nor of being prudent. The second level is that of animals which
        have memory but are unable to hear, and which are therefore prudent but
        incapable of being taught. The third level is that of animals which have
        both of these faculties, and which are therefore prudent and capable of
        being taught. Moreover, there cannot be a fourth level, so that there
        would be an animal which had hearing but lacked memory. For those senses
        which perceive their sensible objects by means of an external medium—and
        hearing is one of these—are found only in animals which have locomotion
        and which cannot do without memory, as has been pointed out (10).
      </p>
      <p>14. <span style="font-weight: bold">Thus other animals</span> (4).</p>
      <p>
        Here he explains the levels of human knowing; and in regard to this he
        does two things. First (14), he explains how human knowing surpasses the
        knowing of the abovementioned animals. Second (17), he shows how human
        knowing is divided into different levels (“Now in men”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, in the first part (4) he says that the life of animals is
        ruled by imagination and memory: by imagination in the case of imperfect
        animals, and by memory in the case of perfect animals. For even though
        the latter also have imagination, still each thing is said to be ruled
        by that [power] which holds the highest place within it. Now in this
        discussion life does not mean the being of a living thing, as it is
        understood in Book II of <i>The Soul</i>, when he says that “for living
        things to live is to be”; for the life of an animal in this sense is not
        a result of memory or imagination but is prior to both of these. But
        life is taken to mean vital activity, just as we are also accustomed to
        speak of association as the life of men. But by the fact that he
        establishes the truth about the cognition of animals with reference to
        the management of life, we are given to understand that knowing belongs
        to these animals, not for the sake of knowing, but because of the need
        for action.
      </p>
      <p>
        15. Now, as is stated below (18), in men the next thing above memory is
        experience, which some animals have only to a small degree. For an
        experience arises from the association of many singular [intentions]
        received in memory. And this kind of association is proper to man, and
        pertains to the cogitative power (also called particular reason), which
        associates particular intentions just as universal reason associates
        universal ones. Now since animals are accustomed to pursue or avoid
        certain things as a result of many sensations and memory, for this
        reason they seem to share something of experience, even though it be
        slight. But above experience, which belongs to particular reason, men
        have as their chief power a universal reason by means of which they
        live.
      </p>
      <p>
        16. And just as experience is related to particular reason [in men], and
        customary activity to memory in animals, in a similar way art is related
        to universal reason. Therefore, just as the life of animals is ruled in
        a perfect way by memory together with activity that has become habitual
        through training, or in any other way whatsoever, in a similar way man
        is ruled perfectly by reason perfected by art. Some men, however, are
        ruled by reason without art; but this rule is imperfect.
      </p>
      <p>17. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now in men</span> (5).</p>
      <p>
        Here he explains the different levels of human knowing; and in regard to
        this he does two things. First (17), he compares art with experience;
        and, second (31), he compares speculative art with practical art (“It is
        only fitting”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He treats the first point in two ways. First, he explains how art and
        experience originate. Second (20), he explains how one is superior to
        the other (“In practical matters”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he explains how each
        of the above originates. Second (18), he makes this clear by means of an
        example (“For to judge”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he describes how
        experience originates, and second (18), how art originates (“But in men,
        science”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says first (5), then, that in men experience is caused by memory. The
        way in which it is caused is this: from several memories of a single
        thing a man acquires experience about some matter, and by means of this
        experience he is able to act easily and correctly. Therefore, because
        experience provides us with the ability to act easily and correctly, it
        seems to be almost the same as science and art. For they are alike
        inasmuch as in either case from many instances a single view of a thing
        is obtained. But they differ inasmuch as universals are grasped by art
        and singular things by experience, as is stated later (18).
      </p>
      <p>
        18.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But in men science and art</span> (6).
        Here he describes the way in which art arises. He says that in men
        science and art come from experience, and he proves this on the
        authority of Polus, whp says that “Experience causes art and
        inexperience luck.” For when an inexperienced person acts correctly,
        this happens by chance. Furthermore, the way in which art arises from
        experience is the same as the way spoken of above in which experience
        arises from memory. For just as one experiential cognition comes from
        many memories of a thing, so does one universal judgment abour all
        similar things come from the apprehension of many experiences. Hence art
        has this [unified view] more than experience, because experience is
        concerned only with singulars, whereas art has to do with universals.
      </p>
      <p>
        19. Thereupon he makes this clear by means of examples (“But in men”).
        For when a man has learned that this medicine has been beneficial to
        Socrates and Plato, and to many other individuals who were suffering
        from some particular disease, whatever it may be, this is a matter of
        experience; but when a man learns that this particular treatment is
        beneficial to A men who have some particular kind of disease and some
        particular kind of physical constitution, as it has benefited the
        feverish, both the phlegmatic and the bilious, this is now a matter of
        art.
      </p>
      <p>
        20. <span style="font-weight: bold">In practical matters</span> (7).
      </p>
      <p>
        He compares art to experience from the viewpoint of pre-eminence; and in
        regard to this he does two things. First (20), he compares them from the
        viewpoint of action; and, second (23), from the viewpoint of knowledge
        (“Yet we think”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says then that in practical matters experience seems to differ in no
        way from art; for when it comes to acting, the difference between
        experience and art, which is a difference between the universal and the
        singular, disappears, because art operates with reference to singulars
        just as experience does. Therefore the aforesaid difference pertains
        only to the way in which they come to know. But even though art and
        experience do not differ in the way in which they act, because both act
        on singular things, nevertheless they differ in the effectiveness of
        their action. For men of experience act more effectively than those who
        have the universal knowledge of an art but lack experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        21. The reason is that actions have to do with singular things, and all
        processes of generation belong to singular things. For universals are
        generated or moved only by reason of something else, inasmuch as this
        belongs to singular things. For man is generated when this man is
        generated. Hence a physician heals man only incidentally, but properly
        he heals Plato or Socrates, or some man that can be individually named,
        to whom the nature man belongs, or rather to whom it is accidental
        inasmuch as he is the one healed. For even though the nature man belongs
        essentially to Socrates, still it belongs only accidentally to the one
        healed or cured; for the proposition “Socrates is a man” is an essential
        one, because, if Socrates were defined, man would be given in his
        definition, as will be said below in Book IV.” But the proposition “What
        is healed or cured is man” is an accidental one.
      </p>
      <p>
        22. Hence, since art has to do with universals and experience with
        singulars, if anyone has the theoretical knowledge of an art but lacks
        experience, he will be perfect insofar as he knows the universal; but
        since he does not know the singular, because he lacks experience, he
        will very often make mistakes in healing. For healing belongs to the
        realm of the singular rather than to that of the universal, because it
        belongs to the former essentially and to the latter accidentally.
      </p>
      <p>23. <span style="font-weight: bold">Yet we think</span> (8).</p>
      <p>
        Here he compares art with experience from the viewpoint of knowing; and
        in regard to this he does two things. First (23), he states how art is
        superior to experience; and second (24), he proves this (“Now this is
        because”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He claims that art and science are superior to experience in three
        respects. First, they are superior from the viewpoint of scientific
        knowledge, which we think is attained by art rather than by experience.
        Second, they are superior from the viewpoint of meeting objections,
        which occurs in disputes. For in a dispute the one who has an art is
        able to meet the objections raised against that art, but one who has
        experience [alone] cannot do this. Third, they are superior from this
        point of view, that those who have an art come nearer to the goal of
        wisdom than men of experience, “Implying that it is,” i.e., happens to
        be, “more truly to know if wisdom pursues all things,” i.e., insofar as
        it pursues universals. For one who has an art is judged wiser than one
        who has experience, by reason of the fact that he considers universals.
        Or in another version: “Implying that it is more according to wisdom to
        know as one pursuing all things,” i.e., universals. Another reading has:
        “As more conformable to knowing, since wisdom pursues all things,” as if
        to say: “As more dependent upon knowing” than upon doing, “since wisdom
        pursues all things,” i.e., it seeks to reach each single thing; so that
        those are rather called wise who are more knowing, not those who are
        more men of action. Hence another reading expresses this meaning more
        clearly, saying: “Implying that all pursue wisdom more with respect to
        knowing.”
      </p>
      <p>24. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now this is</span> (9).</p>
      <p>
        Then he proves the superiority of art and science mentioned above, and
        he does this by means of three arguments. The first runs thus: those who
        know the cause and reason why a thing is so are more knowing and wiser
        than those who merely know that it is so but do not know why. Now men of
        experience know that something is so but do not know the reason, whereas
        men who have an art know not merely that something is so but also know
        its cause and reason. Hence those who have an art are wiser and more
        knowing than those who have experience.
      </p>
      <p>25. <span style="font-weight: bold">For this reason too</span> (9).</p>
      <p>
        Here he proves the first aspect of superiority, and this runs as
        follows. Those who know the cause and reason why a thing is so are
        compared to those who merely know that it is so as the architectonic
        arts are to the arts of manual laborers. But the architectonic arts are
        nobler. In a similar way, then, those who know the causes and reasons of
        things are more knowing than those who merely know that things are so.
      </p>
      <p>
        26. The first part of this proof becomes clear from the fact that
        architects, or master artists, know the causes of the things that are
        done. In order to understand this we must note that architect means
        chief artist, from αρχος meaning chief, and τεχνη meaning art. Now that
        art is said to be a chief art which performs a more important operation.
        Indeed, the operations of artists are distinguished in this way; for
        some operations are directed to disposing the material of the artifact.
        Carpenters, for example, by cutting and planing the wood, dispose matter
        for the form of a ship. Another operation is directed to introducing
        this form into the matter, for example, when someone builds a ship out
        of wood which has been disposed and prepared. A third operation is
        directed to the use of the finished product, and this is the highest
        operation. But the first operation is the lowest because it is directed
        to the second and the second to the third. Hence the shipbuilder is a
        superior artist compared with the one who prepares the wood; and the
        navigator, who uses the completed ship, is a superior artist
        comparedwith the shipbuilder.
      </p>
      <p>
        27. Further, since matter exists for the sake of form, and ought to be
        such as to befit the form, the shipbuilder knows the rea son why the
        wood should be shaped in some particular way; but those who prepare the
        wood do not know this. And in a similar way, since the completed ship
        exists in order to be used, the one who uses the ship knows why it
        should have some particular form; for the form should be one that befits
        its use. Thus it is evident that the reason for the operations which
        dispose the matter is taken from the design of the product in the
        artist’s mind, and the reason for the operations which produce the form
        of the artifact is taken from the use [to which the artifact is put].
      </p>
      <p>
        28. It is evident, then, that the master artists know the causes of the
        things which are done. In fact we judge and speak about the others,
        i.e., the manual laborers, as we do about certain inanimate things. This
        is not because they do not perform artful operations, but because the
        things which they do they do without knowing the cause; for they know
        that something is to be done but not why it is, just as fire burns
        without knowing why. Hence there is a likeness between inanimate things
        and manual laborers from this point of view, that, just as inanimate
        things act without knowing the causes, inasmuch as they are directed to
        their proper end by a superior intellect, so also do manual laborers.
        But they differ in this respect, that inanimate things perform each of
        their operations as a result of their nature, whereas manual laborers
        perform theirs through habit. And while habit is practically the same as
        nature inasmuch as it is inclined to one definite effect, still habit
        differs from nature inasmuch as it is open to opposites by reason of
        human knowledge. For we do not habituate natural bodies, as is stated in
        Book II of the <i>Ethics</i>; nor, indeed, is it possible to cause
        habits in things that lack knowledge. Now the statements that have been
        made, as is evident from the statements themselves, must be interpreted
        as meaning that some men are wiser, not insofar as they are “practical,”
        i.e., men of action, as befits men of experience, but insofar as they
        have a plan for things to be done and know their causes, which are the
        basis of such a plan; and this befits master artists.
      </p>
      <p>
        29.
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >In general a sign of scientific knowledge</span
        >
        (10).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument, which is as follows: a sign of
        knowledge is the ability to teach, and this is so because each thing is
        perfect in its activity when it can produce another thing similar to
        itself, as is said in Book IV of <i>Meteors</i>. Therefore, just as the
        possession of heat is indicated by the fact that a thing can heat
        something else, in a similar way the possession of knowledge is
        indicated by the fact that one can teach, that is, cause knowledge in
        another. But men who have an art can teach, for since they know causes
        they can demonstrate from these; and demonstration is a syllogism which
        produces knowledge, as is said in Book I of the
        <i>Posterior Analytics</i>. But men who have experience [only] cannot
        teach; for since they do not know the causes, they cannot cause
        knowledge in someone else. And if they do teach others the things which
        they know by experience, these things are not learned after the manner
        of scientific knowledge but after that of opinion or belief. Hence, it
        is clear that men who have an art are wiser and more knowing than those
        who have experience.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Furthermore, we do not hold</span> (11).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument, which is as follows: knowing singular
        things is proper to the senses rather than to any other type of knowing
        [power], since our entire knowledge of singular things originates with
        the senses. Yet we do not hold that “any one of these,” i.e., any one of
        the senses, is wisdom, because even though each sense knows that a thing
        is so, it does not know why it is so; for touch judges that fire is hot
        but does not know why it is hot. Therefore men of experience, who have a
        knowledge of singular things but do not know their causes, cannot be
        called wise men.
      </p>
      <p>31. <span style="font-weight: bold">It is only fitting</span> (12).</p>
      <p>
        Here he compares practical art with speculative art; and in regard to
        this he does three things. First (20), he shows that a speculative art
        is wisdom to a greater degree than a practical art. Second
        (<i>ibid.</i>), he answers an objection (“The difference”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He proves his first statement by this argument: in any of the sciences
        or arts we find that men with scientific knowledge are more admired and
        are held in higher esteem than all other men, because their knowledge is
        held to be nobler and more worthy of the name of wisdom. Now the
        discoverer of any art at all is admired because he perceives, judges and
        discerns a cause beyond the perceptions of other men, and not because of
        the usefulness of his discoveries. We admire him rather “as being wise,
        and as distinguishing [a thing] from others.” As being wise, indeed, in
        the subtle way in which he investigates the causes of his discoveries,
        and as distinguishing [a thing] from others insofar as he investigates
        the ways in which one thing differs from another. Or, according to
        another interpretation, “as being distinct from the others” is to be
        read passively, as being distinguished in this respect from others.
        Hence another text has “one who is different.” Some sciences, then, are
        more admirable and worthy of the name of wisdom because their
        observations are more outstanding, not because they are useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        32. Therefore, since many useful arts have been discovered (some to
        provide the necessities of life, as the mechanical arts, and others to
        introduce us to the sciences, as the logical disciplines), those artists
        must be said to be wiser whose sciences were discovered not for the sake
        of utility but merely for the sake of knowing, that is to say, the
        speculative sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
        33. That the speculative sciences were not discovered for the sake of
        utility is made clear by this fact, that after all sciences of this kind
        “had already been developed,” i.e., acquired or discovered, which can
        serve as introductions to the other sciences, or provide the necessities
        of life, or give pleasure (as those arts whose object is to delight
        man), the speculative sciences were discovered, not for this kind of
        end, but for their own sake. The fact that they were not discovered for
        the sake of utility becomes evident from the place in which they were
        discovered. For they originated in those places where men first applied
        themselves to such things. Another version reads, “And first in those
        places where men had leisure,” i.e., they had time for study because
        they were released from other occupations as a result of the abundance
        of things necessary [for life]. Hence the mathematical arts, which are
        speculative in the highest degree, were first discovered in Egypt by the
        priests, who were given time for study, and whose expenses were defrayed
        by the community, as we also read in Genesis (47:22)
      </p>
      <p>
        34. But because the names “wisdom,” “science” and “art” have been used
        indifferently, lest someone should think that these terms are
        synonymous, he excludes this opinion and refers to his work on morals,
        i.e., to Book VI of the <i>Ethics</i>, where he has explained the
        difference between art, wisdom, science, prudence, and understanding.
        And to give the distinction briefly—wisdom, science and understanding
        pertain to the speculative part of the soul, which he speaks of in that
        work as the scientific part of the soul. But they differ in that
        understanding is the habit of the first principles of demonstration,
        whereas science has to do with conclusions drawn from subordinate
        causes, and wisdom with first causes. This is the reason it is spoken of
        there as the chief science. But prudence and art belong to the practical
        part of the soul, which reasons about our contingent courses of action.
        And these also differ; for prudence directs us in actions which do not
        pass over into some external matter but are perfections of the one
        acting (which is the reason why prudence is defined in that work as the
        reasoned plan of things to be done), but art directs us in those
        productive actions, such as building and cutting, which pass over into
        external matter (which is the reason why art is defined as the reasoned
        plan of things to be made).
      </p>
      <p><i>Wisdom deals with causes.</i></p>
      <p>
        35. From what has been said he proves his major thesis, that is to say,
        that wisdom deals with the causes of things. He says that the reason
        “for undertaking this investigation,” i.e., the above piece of
        reasoning, is that the science which is called wisdom seems to be about
        first causes and principles. This is evident from the foregoing; for the
        more a man attains to a knowledge of the cause, the wiser he is. This is
        also evident from the foregoing; because the man of experience is wiser
        than one who has sensation alone without experience; and the artist is
        wiser than any man of experience; and among artists the architect is
        wiser than the manual laborer. And similarly among the arts and sciences
        the speculative are more scientific than the practical. All these things
        are dear from the foregoing remarks. It follows, then, that that science
        which is wisdom in an absolute sense is concerned with the causes of
        things. The method of arguing would be similar if we were to say that
        that which is hotter is more afire, and therefore that that which is
        afire in an absolute sense is hot in an absolute sense.<br />

      </p>
      <p>
        14. But since we are in search of this science, it will therefore be
        necessary to consider with what kind of causes and principles wisdom or
        science deals. This will perhaps become evident if we take the opinions
        which we have about the wise man. First of all, then, we think that the
        wise man is one who knows all things in the highest degree, as becomes
        him, without having a knowledge of them individually.
      </p>
      <p>
        15. Next, we say that that man is wise who is capable of knowing things
        that are difficult and not easy for man to understand. For sensory
        perception is common to all, and is therefore easy and not a matter of
        wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>16. Again, [we consider him wise who is] more certain.</p>
      <p>
        17. And in every branch of science we say that he is wiser who is more
        capable of teaching us about the causes of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        18. Again, among the sciences we think that that science which exists
        for itself and is desirable for the sake of knowledge is wisdom to a
        greater degree than one which is desirable for the sake of contingent
        effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        19. And we think that a superior science which is rather the more basic
        comes nearer to wisdom than a subordinate science. For a wise man must
        not be directed but must direct, and he must not obey another but must
        be obeyed by one who is less wise. Such then and so many are the
        opinions which we have about the wise and about wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        20. Now of these attributes, that of knowing all things necessarily
        belongs to him who has universal knowledge in the highest degree,
        because he knows in which are subordinate.
      </p>
      <p>
        21. But the things which are just about the most difficult for man to
        understand are also those which are most universal; for they are
        farthest removed from the senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        22. Again, the most certain of the sciences are those which are most
        concerned with primary things. For sciences based on fewer principles
        are more certain than those which have additional principles, as
        arithmetic is more certain than geometry.
      </p>
      <p>
        23. Moreover, that science which speculates about the causes of things
        is more instructive. For those who teach us are those who assign the
        causes of every single thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        24. Again, understanding and scientific knowledge for their own sake are
        found in the highest degree in the science which has as its object what
        is most knowable. For one who desires scientific knowledge for itself
        will desire in the highest degree the science which is most truly
        science, and such a science has for its object what is most knowable.
        Now first principles and causes are most knowable; for it is by reason
        of these and from these that other things are known, and not these from
        things which are subordinate to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        25. But that science is highest and superior to subordinate sciences
        which knows the reason why each single thing must be done. This is the
        good of every single thing, and viewed universally it is the greatest
        good in the whole of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        26. In view of everything that has been said, then, the term which we
        are investigating evidently falls to the same science. For this science
        must speculate about first principles and causes, because the good, or
        that for the sake of which something is done, is also one of the causes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Six opinions about who is wise</i></p>
      <p>
        36. Having shown that wisdom is a knowledge of causes, the Philosopher’s
        aim here is to establish with what kinds of causes and what kinds of
        principles it is concerned. He shows that it is concerned with the most
        universal and primary causes, and he argues this from the definition of
        wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to this he does three things. First, he formulates a
        definition of wisdom from the different opinions which men have about
        the wise man and about wisdom. Second (44), he shows that all of these
        are proper to that universal science which considers first and universal
        causes (“Now of these”). Third (50), he draws the conclusion at which he
        aims (“In view of everything”). In regard to the first he gives six
        common opinions which men have entertained about wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        He states the first where he says “But since we are in search”; and this
        opinion is this: in general we all consider those especially to be wise
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >who know all things, as the case demands</span
        >, without having a knowledge of every singular thing. For this is
        impossible, since singular things are infinite in number, and an
        infinite number of things cannot be comprehended by the intellect.
      </p>
      <p>37. <b>Next, we say that</b> (15).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second opinion, which is this: we hold that man to be
        wise who is capable, by reason of his intellect, of knowing
        <span style="font-weight: bold">difficult things</span>, and those which
        are not easy for ordinary men to understand. For sensory perception,
        i.e., the knowing of sensible things, is common to all men, and is
        therefore easy and so not a matter of wisdom. That is to say, it is
        neither a mark nor the office of a wise man. Thus it is clear that
        whatever pertains properly to wisdom is not easily known by all.
      </p>
      <p>38. <b>Again, [we consider]</b> (16).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third opinion, namely, that we say that he is wise
        who, regarding what he knows, is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">more certain</span> than other men
        generally are.
      </p>
      <p>
        39. <b>And in every branch</b> (17). Here he gives the fourth opinion,
        namely, that that man is said to be wiser in every science who can give
        the <span style="font-weight: bold">causes</span> of anything that is
        brought into question, and can teach by means of this.
      </p>
      <p>40. <b>Again, among the sciences</b> (18).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the fifth opinion, which is this: among the many sciences
        that science which is more desirable and
        <span style="font-weight: bold">willed for its own sake</span>, i.e.,
        chosen for the sake of knowledge and for knowledge itself alone, is more
        of the nature of wisdom than one which is for the sake of any of the
        other contingent effects which can be caused by knowledge, such as the
        necessities of life, pleasure, and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        41. <b>And we think</b> (19). Here he gives the sixth opinion, namely,
        that this wisdom, of which mention has been made, must be or is said to
        be “rather the more basic,” i.e.,
        <span style="font-weight: bold">nobler</span>, than “a subordinate
        science.” This can be understood from the foregoing. For in the field of
        the mechanical arts, subordinate artists are those who execute by manual
        operations the commands of superior artists, whom he referred to above
        as master artists and wise men.
      </p>
      <p>
        42. That the notion of wisdom belongs to sciences which give orders
        rather than to those which take them, he proves by two arguments. The
        first is that subordinate sciences are directed to superior sciences.
        For subordinate arts are directed to the end of a superior art, as the
        art of horsemanship to the end of the military art. But in the opinion
        of all it is not fitting that a wise man should be directed by someone
        else, but that he should direct others The second is that inferior
        artists are induced to act by superior artists inasmuch as they rely
        upon superior artists for the things which they must do or make. Thus
        the shipbuilder relies upon the instructions of the navigator for the
        kind of form which a ship ought to have. However, it does not befit a
        wise man that he should be induced to act by someone else, but that he
        should use his knowledge to induce others to act.
      </p>
      <p>
        43. These, then, are the kind of opinions which men have of wisdom and
        the wise; and from all of these a description of wisdom can be
        formulated, so that the wise man is described as one who knows all, even
        difficult matters, with certitude and through their cause; who seeks
        this knowledge for its own sake; and who directs others and induces them
        to act. And in this way the major premise of the syllogism becomes
        evident. For every wise man must be such, and conversely whoever is such
        is wise.
      </p>
      <p><i>These six attributes are found in the metaphysician.</i></p>
      <p>
        44. <b>Now of these</b> (20). Here he shows that all of the above
        attributes come together in the man who knows the first and universal
        causes of things; and he follows the same order as he did above. Thus he
        held first that knowledge of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">all things in the highest degree</span>
        belongs to him who has universal knowledge. This was the first opinion,
        and it is made clear in this way: Whoever knows universals knows in some
        respect the things which are subordinate to universals, because he knows
        the universal in them.’ But all things are subordinate to those which
        are most universal. Therefore the one who knows the most universal
        things, knows in a sense all things.
      </p>
      <p>45. <b>But the things</b> (21).</p>
      <p>
        Here he proves that the second attribute belongs to the same person, by
        the following argument. Those things which are farthest removed from the
        senses are <span style="font-weight: bold">difficult</span> for men to
        know; for sensory perception is common to all men since all human
        knowledge originates with this. But those things which are most
        universal are farthest removed from sensible things, because the senses
        have to do with singular things. Hence universals are the most difficult
        for men to know. Thus it is clear that that science is the most
        difficult which is most concerned with universals.
      </p>
      <p>
        46. But the statement which appears in Book I of the
        <i>Physics</i> seems to contradict this. For it is said there that more
        <i>universal</i> things are known first by us; and those things which
        are known first are those which are easier. Yet it must be said that
        those things which are more universal
        <span style="font-weight: bold">according to simple apprehension</span>
        are known first; for being is the first thing that comes into the
        intellect, as Avicenna says, and animal comes into the intellect before
        man does. For just as in the order of nature, which proceeds from
        potentiality to actuality, animal is prior to man, so too in the genesis
        of knowledge the intellect conceives animal before it conceives man.
      </p>
      <p>
        But with respect to the investigations of natural properties and causes,
        less universal things are known first, because we discover universal
        causes by means of the particular causes which belong to one genus or
        species. Now those things which are universal
        <span style="font-weight: bold">in causing</span> are known subsequently
        by us (notwithstanding the fact that they are things which are primarily
        knowable according to their nature), although things which are universal
        <span style="font-weight: bold">by predication</span> are known to us in
        some way before the less universal (notwithstanding the fact that they
        are not known prior to singular things). For in us sensory knowledge,
        which is cognitive of singular things, precedes intellective knowledge,
        which is about universals. And some importance must also be attached to
        the fact that he does not say that the most universal things are the
        most difficult absolutely, but “just about.” For those things which are
        entirely separate from matter in being, as immaterial substances, are
        more difficult for us to know than universals. Therefore, even though
        this science which is called wisdom is the first in dignity, it is still
        the last to be learned.
      </p>
      <p>47. <b>Again, the most certain</b> (22).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that the third attribute belongs to the same science, by
        this argument: the more any sciences are prior by nature, the more
        <span style="font-weight: bold">certain</span> they are. This is clear
        from the fact that those sciences which are said to originate as a
        result of adding something to the other sciences are less certain than
        those which take fewer things into consideration; for example,
        arithmetic is more certain than geometry because the objects considered
        in geometry are a result of adding to those considered in arithmetic.
        This becomes evident if we consider what these two sciences take as
        their first principle, namely, the point and the unit. For the point
        adds to the unit the notion of position, because undivided being
        constitutes the intelligible structure of the unit; and insofar as this
        has the function of a measure it becomes the principle of number. And
        the point adds to this the notion of position. However, particular
        sciences are subsequent in nature to universal sciences, because their
        subjects add something to the subjects of universal sciences. For
        example, it is evident that mobile being, with which the philosophy of
        nature deals, adds to being pure and simple, with which metaphysics is
        concerned, and to quantified being, with which mathematics is concerned.
        Hence that science which treats of being and the most universal things
        is the most certain. Moreover, the statement here that this science
        deals with fewer principles is not opposed to the one made above, that
        it knows all things; for the universal takes in fewer inferiors
        actually, but many potentially. And the more certain a science is, the
        fewer actual things it has to consider in investigating its
        subject-matter. Hence the practical sciences are the least certain,
        because they must consider the many circumstances attending individual
        effects.
      </p>
      <p>48. <b>Moreover, that science</b> (23).</p>
      <p>
        Here he proves that the fourth attribute belongs to the same science, by
        this argument: that science is more instructive, or better able to
        teach, which is concerned to a greater degree with
        <span style="font-weight: bold">causes</span>. For only those teach who
        assign the causes of every single thing, because scientific knowledge
        comes about through some cause, and to teach is to cause knowledge in
        another. But that science which considers universals considers the first
        of all the causes. Hence it is evidently the best fitted to teach.
      </p>
      <p>49. <b>Again, understanding</b> (24).</p>
      <p>
        Here he proves that the fifth attribute belongs to the same science, by
        this argument: it is the office of those sciences which deal with things
        that are most knowable, most properly to know and understand
        <span style="font-weight: bold">for their own sake</span>, i.e., for the
        sake of those sciences themselves and not for something else. But it is
        the sciences that deal with first causes which consider the most
        knowable things. Therefore those sciences are desired most for their own
        sake. He proves the first premise thus: One who most desires knowledge
        for the sake of knowledge most desires scientific knowledge. But the
        highest kind of knowledge is concerned with things that are most
        knowable. Therefore those sciences are desired most for their own sake
        which have to do with things that are most knowable. He proves the
        second premise thus: Those things from which and by reason of which
        other things are known are more knowable than the things which are known
        by means of them. But these other things are known through causes and
        principles, and not vice versa, etc.
      </p>
      <p>50. <b>But that science</b> (25).</p>
      <p>
        Here he proves that the sixth attribute belongs to the same science, by
        the following argument: that science which considers the final cause, or
        that for the sake of which particular things are done, is related to the
        other sciences as a chief or
        <span style="font-weight: bold">master science</span> is to a
        subordinate or ancillary one, as is evident from the foregoing remarks.
        For the navigator, to whom the use, or end, of the ship belongs, is a
        kind of master artist in relation to the shipbuilder who serves him. But
        the aforesaid science is concerned most with the final cause of all
        things. This is dear from the fact that that for the sake of which all
        particular things are done is the good of each, i.e., a particular good.
        But the end in any class of things is a good; and that which is the end
        of all things, i.e., of the universe itself, is the greatest good in the
        whole of nature. Now this belongs to the consideration of the science in
        question, and therefore it is the chief or architectonic science with
        reference to all the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        51. <b>In view of everything</b> (26). Here he draws from the foregoing
        arguments his intended conclusion, saying that it is clear from
        everything that has been said that the name wisdom which we are
        investigating belongs to the same science which considers or speculates
        about first principles and causes. This is evident from the six primary
        conditions which clearly pertain to the science that considers universal
        causes. But because the sixth condition touched on the consideration of
        the end, which was not clearly held to be a cause among the ancient
        philosophers, as will be said below (1177), he therefore shows in a
        special way that this condition belongs to the same science, namely, the
        one which considers first causes. For the end, which is a good and that
        for the sake of which other things are done, is one of the many causes.
        Hence the science which considers first and universal causes must also
        be the one which considers the universal end of all things, which is the
        greatest good in the whole of nature.<br />

        27. That this is not a practical science is evident from those who first
        philosophized. For it is because of wonder that men both now and
        formerly began to philosophize, about less important matters, and then
        progressing little by little, they raised questions about more important
        ones, such as the phases of the moon and the courses of the sun and the
        stars and the generation of the universe. But one who raises questions
        and wonders seems to be ignorant. Hence the philosopher is also to some
        extent a lover of myth, for myths are composed of wonders. If they
        philosophized, then, in order to escape from ignorance, they evidently
        pursued their studies for the sake of knowledge and not for any utility.
      </p>
      <p>
        28. And what has happened bears witness to this; for when nearly all the
        things necessary for life, leisure and learning were acquired, this kind
        of prudence began to be sought. It is evident, then, that we do not seek
        this knowledge for the sake of any other necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        29. But just as we say that a man is free who exists for himself and not
        for another, in a similar fashion this is the only free, science,
        because it alone exists for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        30. For this reason, too, it might rightly be thought that this science
        is not a human possession, since in many respects human nature is
        servile.
      </p>
      <p>
        31. Hence, according, to Simonides, “Only God has this honor,” I and it
        is unfitting that a man should not seek a knowledge which befits him.
        Some poets accordingly say that the deity is naturally envious; and it
        is most likely that it should happen in this case, and that all those
        who are imperfect are unfortunate. But it is not fitting that the deity
        should be envious, for as the proverb says: “The poets tell many lies.”
      </p>
      <p>
        32. Nor must we think that any other science is more honorable than
        this. For what is most divine is most honorable. But then it alone will
        be such, and in two ways. For of all knowledge that which God most
        properly has is divine; and if there is any such knowledge, it is
        concerned with divine matters. But this science alone has both of these
        characteristics; for God seems to be a cause and in some sense a
        principle according to all men; and such [knowledge as this] God either
        alone has, or has in the highest degree. Therefore, all the other
        sciences are more necessary, but none is more excellent.
      </p>
      <p>
        33. But it is necessary in a sense to bring to a halt the progression of
        this science at the contrary of our original questions. Indeed, as we
        have said, all men begin by wondering whether things are as strange as
        chance occurrences appear to those who do not yet know the cause; or by
        wondering about the changes in the course of the sun, or about the
        incommensurability of the diagonal [of a square]. For it would seem an
        object of wonder to all it something having the nature of number were
        immeasurable. But it is necessary to advance to the contrary view and,
        as the proverb says, the worthier one, as also happens in a sense in
        these matters when men have learned them. For nothing would surprise a
        geometrician more than if the diagonal [of a square] should become
        commensurable [with a side]. It has been stated, then, what the nature
        is of the science which we are seeking, and what its goal is for which
        our search and whole method must be undertaken.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Why this science is called speculative</i></p>
      <p>
        53. First, he gives this argument. No science in which knowledge itself
        is sought for its own sake is a practical science, but a speculative
        one. Bot that science which is wisdom, or philosophy as it is called,
        exists for the sake of knowledge itself. Hence it is speculative and not
        practical. He proves the minor premise in this way. Whoever seeks as an
        end to escape from ignorance tends toward knowledge for itself. But
        those who philosophize seek as an end to escape from ignorance.
        Therefore they tend towards knowledge for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        54. That they seek to escape from ignorance is made clear from the fact
        that those who first philosophized and who now philosophize did so from
        wonder about some cause, although they did this at first differently
        than now. For at first they wondered about less important problems,
        which were more obvious, in order that they might know their cause; but
        later on, progressing little by little from the knowledge of more
        evident matters to the investigation of obscure ones, they began to
        raise questions about more important and hidden matters, such as the
        changes undergone by the moon, namely, its eclipse, and its change of
        shape, which seems to vary inasmuch as it stands in different relations
        to the sun. And similarly they raised questions about the phenomena of
        the sun, such as its eclipse, its movement and size; and about the
        phenomena of the stars, such as their size, arrangement, and so forth;
        and about the origin of the whole universe, which some said was produced
        by chance, others by an intelligence, and others by love.
      </p>
      <p>
        55. Further, he points out that perplexity and
        <span style="font-weight: bold">wonder</span> arise from ignorance. For
        when we see certain obvious effects whose cause we do not know, we
        wonder about their cause. And since wonder was the motive which led men
        to philosophy, it is evident that the philosopher is, in a sense, a
        philo-myth, i.e., a lover of myth, as is characteristic of the poets.
        Hence the first men to deal with the principles of things in a mythical
        way, such as Perseus and certain others who were the seven sages, were
        called the theologizing poets. Now the reason why the philosopher is
        compared to the poet is that both are concerned with wonders. For the
        myths with which the poets deal are composed of wonders, and the
        philosophers themselves were moved to philosophize as a result of
        wonder. And since wonder stems from ignorance, they were obviously moved
        to philosophize in order to escape from ignorance. It is accordingly
        evident from this that “they pursued” knowledge, or diligently sought
        it, only for itself and not for any utility or usefulness.
      </p>
      <p>
        56. Now we must note that, while this science was first designated by
        the name wisdom, this was later changed to the name philosophy, since
        they mean the same thing. For while the ancients who pursued the study
        of wisdom were called sophists, i.e., wise men, Pythagoras, when asked
        what he professed himself to be, refused to call himself a wise man as
        his predecessors had done, because he thought this was presumptuous, but
        called himself a philosopher, i.e., a lover of wisdom. And from that
        time the name “wise man” was changed to “philosopher,” and “wisdom” to
        “philosophy.” This name also contributes something to the point under
        discussion, for that man seems to be a lover of wisdom who seeks wisdom,
        not for some other reason, but for itself alone. For he who seeks one
        thing on account of something else, has greater love for that on whose
        account he seeks than for that which he seeks.
      </p>
      <p>57. <b>And what has happened</b> (28).</p>
      <p>
        Here he proves the same point by means of an example. The statement (he
        says) that wisdom or philosophy is not sought for any utility but for
        knowledge itself is proved by “what has happened,” i.e., by what has
        occurred in the case of those who have pursued philosophy. For when
        nearly all those [arts] were discovered which are necessary for life,
        “leisure” (i.e., for the sort of pleasure which consists in a life of
        ease), and learning, such as the logical sciences, which are not sought
        for themselves but as introductions to the other arts, then man began
        for the first time to seek this kind of prudence, namely, wisdom. And
        from this it is clear that wisdom is not sought because of any necessity
        other than itself but for itself a one; for no one seeks something which
        he already possesses. Hence, because wisdom was sought after all other
        knowledge had been discovered, it is evident that it was not sought for
        some reason other than itself but for itself.
      </p>
      <p><i>Why this science is liberal</i></p>
      <p>58. <b>But just as</b> (29).</p>
      <p>
        Here he proves the second attribute, namely, that wisdom is free; and he
        uses the following argument: that man is properly said to be free who
        does not exist for someone else but for himself. For slaves exist for
        their masters, work for them, and acquire for them whatever they
        acquire. But free men exist for themselves inasmuch as they acquire
        things for themselves and work for themselves. But only this science
        exists for itself; and therefore among all the sciences only this
        science is free.
      </p>
      <p>
        59. Now we must note that this can be understood in two ways. In one
        way, the expression “only this” may indicate
        <span style="font-weight: bold">every speculative science</span> as a
        class. And then it is true that only this class of science is sought for
        itself. Hence, only those arts which are directed to knowing are called
        free [or liberal] arts, whereas those which are directed to some useful
        end attained by action are called mechanical or servile arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understood in another way, the expression may specifically indicate this
        philosophy or wisdom which deals with the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">highest causes</span>; for the final
        cause is also one of the highest causes, as was stated above (51).
        Therefore this science must consider the highest and universal end of
        all things. And in this way all the other sciences are subordinated to
        it as an end. Hence only this science exists in the highest degree for
        itself.
      </p>
      <p><i>Why this science is super-human</i></p>
      <p>60. <b>For this reason</b> (30).</p>
      <p>
        Here he proves the third attribute, namely, that this science is not a
        human [possession]. In regard to this he does two things. First, he
        proves his thesis. Second (61), he criticizes an erroneous view held by
        certain men (“Hence, according to Simonides”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He proves his thesis by the following argument. A science which is free
        in the highest degree cannot be a possession of that nature which is
        servile and subordinate in many respects. But
        <span style="font-weight: bold">human nature is servile</span> “in many
        respects,” i.e., in many ways. Therefore this science is not a human
        possession. Now human nature is said to be servile insofar as it stands
        in need of many things. And on this account it happens that man
        sometimes neglects what should be sought for its own sake because of the
        things necessary for life. Thus it is said in Book III of the
        <i>Topics</i> that it is better to philosophize than to become wealthy,
        although sometimes becoming wealthy is more desirable, that is, to one
        lacking life’s necessities. From this it is clear that that wisdom is
        sought for itself alone which does not belong to man as his proper
        possession. For man has as his possession what he can have at his
        command and use freely. But that science which is sought for itself
        alone, man cannot use freely, since he is often kept from it because of
        the necessities of life. Nor again is it subject to man’s command,
        because man cannot acquire it perfectly. Yet that very small part of it
        which he does have outweighs all the things known through the other
        sciences.
      </p>
      <p>61. <b>Hence, according to Simonides</b> (31).</p>
      <p>
        Here he rejects the error of a certain poet, Simonides, who said that it
        is proper to God alone to have the honor of desiring that knowledge
        which ought to be sought for its own sake and not for the sake of
        something else. But it is not fitting that man should not seek that
        knowledge which is in keeping with his own condition, namely, that which
        is directed to the necessities of life required by man.
      </p>
      <p>
        62. Now Simonides’ error came from that of certain poets who said that
        the Deity is envious, and that since He is envious He does not desire
        that the things which pertain to His honor should be shared by all. And
        if God is envious of men in other things, He is rightly more so in this
        case, i.e., in the case of the science which is sought for its own sake,
        which is the most honorable of all the sciences. And according to the
        opinion of these men it follows that all who are imperfect are
        unfortunate’ for they said that men are fortunate as a result of the
        providence of the gods, who communicate their goods to men. Hence as a
        result of the envy of the gods, who are unwilling to communicate their
        goods, it follows that men, who remain outside the perfection of this
        science, are unfortunate.
      </p>
      <p>
        63. But the basis of this opinion is most false, because it is not
        fitting that any divine being should be envious. This is evident from
        the fact that envy is sadness at someone else’s prosperity. But this can
        occur only because the one who is envious thinks that someone else’s
        good diminishes his own. Now it is impossible that God’ should be sad,
        because He is not subject to evil of any kind. Nor can His goodness be
        diminished by someone else’s goodness, since every good flows from His
        goodness as from an unfailing spring. Hence Plato also said that there
        is no envy of any kind in God.’ But the poets have lied not only in this
        matter but in many others, as is stated in the common proverb.
      </p>
      <p><i>Why this science is most honorable</i></p>
      <p>64. <b>Nor must we think</b> (32).</p>
      <p>
        Here he proves the fourth attribute, namely, that this is the most
        honorable science, by the following argument. That science which is most
        divine is most honorable, just as God Himself is also the most honorable
        of all things. But this science is the most divine, and is therefore the
        most honorable. The minor premise is proved in this way: a science is
        said to be divine in two ways, and only this science is said to be
        divine in both ways. First, the science which God has is said to be
        divine; and second, the science which is about divine matters is said to
        be divine. But it is evident that only this science meets both of these
        requirements, because, since this science is about first causes and
        principles, it must be about God; for God is understood in this way by
        all inasmuch as He is one of the causes and a principle of things.
        Again, such a science which is about God and first causes, either God
        alone has or, if not He alone, at least He has it in the highest degree.
        Indeed, He alone has it in a perfectly comprehensive way. And He has it
        in the highest degree inasmuch as it is also had by men in their own
        way, although it is not had by them as a human possession, but as
        something borrowed from Him.
      </p>
      <p>
        65. From these considerations he draws the further conclusion that all
        other sciences are more necessary than this science for use in practical
        life, for these sciences are sought least of all for themselves. But
        none of the other sciences can be more excellent than this one.
      </p>
      <p><i>The relation between wonder and wisdom</i></p>
      <p>66. <b>But it is necessary</b> (33).</p>
      <p>
        He now gives the goal toward which this science moves. He says that its
        progression comes to rest, or is terminated, in the contrary of what was
        previously found in those who first sought this science, as also happens
        in the case of natural generations and motions. For each motion is
        terminated in the contrary of that from which the motion begins. Hence,
        since investigation is a kind of movement towards knowledge, it must be
        terminated in the contrary of that from which it begins. But, as was
        stated above (53), the investigation of this science began with man’s
        <span style="font-weight: bold">wonder</span> about all things, because
        the first philosophers wondered about less important matters and
        subsequent philosophers about more hidden ones. And the object of their
        wonder was whether the case was like that of strange chance occurrences,
        i.e., things which seem to happen mysteriously by chance. For things
        which happen as if by themselves are called chance occurrences. For men
        wonder most of all when things happen by
        <span style="font-weight: bold">chance</span> in this way, supposing
        that they were foreseen or determined by some cause. For chance
        occurrences are not determined by a cause, and wonder results from
        ignorance of a cause. Therefore when men were not yet able to recognize
        the causes of things, they wondered about all things as if they were
        chance occurrences; just as they wondered about changes in the course of
        the sun, which are two in number, namely, the solstices, that of winter
        and that of summer. For at the summer solstice the sun begins to decline
        toward the south, after previously declining toward the north. But at
        the winter solstice the opposite occurs. And they wondered also that the
        diagonal of a square is not commensurable with a side. For since to be
        immeasurable seems to belong to the indivisible alone (just as unity
        alone is what is not measured by number but itself measures all
        numbers), it seems to be a matter of wonder that something which is not
        indivisible is immeasurable, and consequently that what is not a
        smallest part is immeasurable. Now it is evident that the diagonal of a
        square and its side are neither indivisible nor smallest parts. Hence it
        seems a matter of wonder if they are not commensurable.
      </p>
      <p>
        67. Therefore, since philosophical investigation began with wonder, it
        must end in or arrive at the contrary of this, and this is to advance to
        the worthier view, as the common proverb agrees, which states that one
        must always advance to the better. For what that opposite and worthier
        view is, is evident in the case of the above wonders, because when men
        have already learned the causes of these things they do not wonder. Thus
        the geometrician does not wonder if the diagonal is incommensurable with
        a side. For he knows the reason for this, namely, that the proportion of
        the square of the diagonal to the square of a side is not as the
        proportion of the square of a number to the square of a number, but as
        the proportion of two to one. Hence it follows that the proportion of a
        side to the diagonal is not as the proportion of number to number. And
        from this it is evident that they cannot be made commensurable. For only
        those lines are commensurable which are proportioned to each other as
        number to number. Hence the goal of this science to which we should
        advance will be that in knowing the causes of things we do not wonder
        about their effects.
      </p>

        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >From what has been said, then, it is evident what the nature of this
          science is, namely, that it is speculative and free, and that it is
          not a human possession but a divine one; and also what its aim is, for
          which the whole inquiry, method, and art must be conducted. For its
          goal is the first and universal causes of things, about which it also
          makes investigations and establishes the truth. And by reason of the
          knowledge of these it reaches this goal, namely, that there should be
          no wonder because the causes of things are known.</span

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 3: 983a 24-984a 16
      </p>
      <p>
        34. It is evident, then, that one must acquire scientific knowledge of
        those causes which stand at the beginning, for we say that we have
        scientific knowledge of each thing when we think we comprehend its first
        cause. Now causes are spoken of in four ways. Of these we say that one
        is the substance or quiddity of a thing, for the first “why” of a thing
        is reduced to its ultimate intelligible structure, and the first why of
        a thing is a cause or principle; another is the matter or subject; a
        third is the source of motion; and a fourth is the cause which is
        opposite to this, namely, that for the sake of which, or the good; for
        this is the goal of every generation and motion. There has been
        sufficient consideration of these in our works on nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        35. However, let us examine those who have undertaken an investigation
        of existing things and have philosophized about the truth before us. For
        evidently they too speak of certain principles and causes. Therefore, to
        us who come later [their views] will serve as an introduction to the
        study which we are now making; for we shall either discover some other
        class of cause, or be more convinced of those which have just been
        expounded.
      </p>
      <p>
        36. Most of those who first philosophized thought that only the things
        which belong to the class of matter are the principles of all things.
        For that of which all things are composed, from which they first come to
        be, and into which they are finally dissolved, while their substance
        remains although it is changed in its attributes—this they call the
        element and principle of existing things.
      </p>
      <p>
        37. And for this reason they thought that nothing is either generated or
        corrupted, as if such a reality always remained in existence. And just
        as we do not say that Socrates comes to be in an unqualified sense when
        he becomes good or musical, or is corrupted when he loses these states,
        because the subject Socrates himself remains, in the same way they say
        that nothing else is generated or corrupted. For there must be some
        matter, either one or more than one, from which other things come to be,
        and which itself remains in existence. However, they do not all speak in
        the same way about the number and nature of such a principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        38. Thales, the originator of this kind of philosophy, says that this
        principle is water; and this is why he also claimed that the earth rests
        upon water.
      </p>
      <p>
        39. For presumably he took this position because he saw that the
        nutriment of all things is moist, that heat itself is generated from
        this, and that animal life comes from this. But that from which each
        thing comes to be is a principle of all things. He bases his opinion on
        this, then, and on the fact that the seeds of all things have a moist
        nature, whereas water is by nature the principle of moist things.
      </p>
      <p>
        40. Moreover, there are some who think that the ancients who lived long
        before the present generation and were the first to speculate about the
        gods held this view about the nature of things. For they made Oceanus
        and Tethys the parents of generation, and held the oath of the gods to
        be by a body of water, to which the poets gave the name Styx. For what
        is oldest is most honorable, and what is most honorable is that by which
        one swears. Whether this view of nature is in fact the ancient and
        primary one is perhaps uncertain. Thales is said to have expressed
        himself in this way about the first cause, but no one could say that
        Hippo is to be included in this group, because of the weakness of his
        understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        41. Anaximenes and Diogenes hold that air is prior to water and is the
        most fundamental of the simple bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        42. Hippasus of Metopontium and Heraclitus of Ephesus hold that fire [is
        the primary principle].
      </p>
      <p>
        43. Empedocles holds that there are four [simple bodies], since he adds
        a fourth—earth—to those already mentioned. For he says that these always
        remain and only become many or few in number by being combined into a
        unity and separated out of a unity.
      </p>
      <p>
        44. Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, who was prior to Empedocles in years but
        later in his speculations, says that the principles of things are
        infinite in number. For he says that nearly all bodies which are made up
        of parts like themselves, such as fire or water, are generated or
        corrupted in this way, merely by combining and separating; but that
        otherwise they are neither generated nor corrupted but always remain in
        existence. From these views, then, one might think that the only cause
        is the one which is said to belong to the class of matter.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        69. Having set f orth a preface in which he indicates the aim of this
        science, its dignity and goal, Aristotle begins to deal with this
        science; and this is divided into two parts. In the first (70), he
        explains what the first philosophers had to say about the causes of
        things. In the second (274), he begins to pursue the truth of this
        science. He does this in Book II (“Theoretical, i.e., speculative,
        knowledge”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two members. First, he gives the opinions
        of the philosophers about the causes of things. Second (181), he
        criticizes them insofar as their statements are unsatisfactory
        (“Therefore all those”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the firsthe does two things. First, he takes up again the
        enumeration of causes which was treated in greater detail in Book II of
        the <i>Physics</i>. Second (72), he presents the opinions of the
        philosophers (“However, let us examine”).
      </p>
      <p><i>The four causes, & three characteristics of final cause</i></p>
      <p>
        70. Accordingly, he says, first, that since it is evident that wisdom
        speculates about causes, we ought to begin by acquiring knowledge from
        the causes of things. This also seems to be in keeping with the
        intelligible structure of science, because we say that we know each
        thing scientifically when we think we are not ignorant of its cause. Now
        causes are spoken of in four ways. (1) One of these is the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">formal</span> cause, which is the very
        substance of a thing by which we know what each thing is. For it is well
        known, as is stated in Book II of the <i>Physics</i>, that we do not say
        that anything has a nature before it has received a form. Now it is
        clear that a form is a cause, because the question “Why is something
        so?” we reduce to its formal cause as its ultimate explanation,
        beginning with proximate forms and proceeding to the ultimate form. But
        evidently the “why?” asks about a cause and principle. Hence it is
        evident that a form is a cause. (2) A second cause is the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">material</span> cause. (3) A third is
        the <span style="font-weight: bold">efficient</span> cause, which is the
        source of motion. (4) A fourth is the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">final</span> cause, which is opposite to
        the efficient cause as a goal is to a starting-point; for motion begins
        with the efficient cause and terminates with the final cause. This
        [latter] cause is also that for the sake of which a thing comes to be,
        and the good of each nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        71. He makes the <span style="font-weight: bold">final</span> cause
        known by three considerations: (1) It is the goal of motion, and thus is
        opposite to the source of motion, which is the efficient cause. (2) It
        is first in intention, and for this reason is said to be that for the
        sake of which [something is done]. (3) It is desirable of itself, and
        for this reason is called a good; for the good is what all desire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, in explaining how the final cause is opposite to the efficient
        cause, he says that it is the goal [or end] of every process of
        generation and motion, whose starting-point is the efficient cause. By
        these two types of change he seems to imply that there is a twofold
        goal: (1) For the goal of a process of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">generation</span> is the form itself,
        which is a part of a thing. (2) But the goal of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">motion</span> is something sought for
        outside the thing moved. He says that he has treated these causes at
        sufficient length in the <i>Physics</i>, lest he should be asked to make
        a more extensive treatment of them.
      </p>
      <p>72. <b>However, let us examine</b> (35).</p>
      <p>
        Here he states what the philosophers had to say about the causes; and in
        regard to this he does two things. First, he gives the reasons why this
        must be done; and, second (36:C 73), he begins to carry out his plan
        ("Most of those").
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, he says that even though there is a treatise on the causes
        in the <i>Physics</i> it is still necessary to consider the opinions of
        the philosophers who first undertook an investigation of the natures of
        existing things, and have philosophized about the truth before him;
        because they too set down causes and principles. Therefore, for us who
        have come later, a consideration of their opinions will be "a first
        [step]," or preamble, "to the investigation," i.e., to the art which we
        are now seeking. Hence the text of Boethius also says: "Therefore as we
        enter upon the task of this science, their opinions will constitute a
        prearn ble to the road that is now to be travelled." Another text has:
        "Therefore to us who are beginning this inquiry it will be a certain
        vital work in the investigation that now confronts us, " and it must be
        read in this way: "Therefore, as we enter upon our present course,"
        i.e., upon the present study and art, it will be necessary to consider
        the opinion of these men "as a work of life," that is to say, as
        necessary, like works which are done for the preservation of life, so
        that this reading is interpreted as a metaphorical way of speaking,
        meaning by "work of life" anything necessary. Now this is useful,
        because from the opinions of these men we will either discover another
        class of causes over and above those already enumerated, or be more
        convinced of the things that have just been stated about the causes,
        namely, that there are four classes of them.
      </p>
      <p>73. <b>Most of those</b> (36).</p>
      <p>
        Here he begins to deal with the opinions of the ancient philosophers;
        and in regard to this he does two things. First (36), he states their
        opinions; and, second (86:C 181) he finds fault with them ("Therefore
        all those").
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he states the opinions
        which each one of the philosophers held about the causes. Second (79:C
        170, he summarizes the discussion ("We have examined").
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two members. In the first (36:C 74), he
        gives the opinions of those who omitted the formal cause. In the second
        (69:C 151), he gives the opinion of Plato, who was the first to posit a
        formal cause ("After the philosophies").
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he gives the opinion
        of those who claimed that certain evident things are principles. Second
        (55:C, 12), he gives the opinions of those who devised extrinsic
        principles ("Leucippus").
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he touches on the
        opinions which the ancient philosophers held about the material cause;
        and, second (45:C 93), on their opinions about the efficient cause ("But
        as men").
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he states in a general
        way the views of those who posited a material cause. Second (38:C 77),
        he examines their views in detail ("Thales, the originator").
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he states their
        opinions about the material cause. Second (37:C 75), he states their
        opinions about the generation of things, which follow from the first
        ("And for this reason").
      </p>
      <p><i>OPINIONS OF THOSE WHO GAVE ONLY MATERIAL CAUSE</i></p>
      <p><i>Four characteristics of matter</i></p>
      <p>
        74. Accordingly he says, first (36), that most of those who first
        philosophized about the natural world held that the principles of all
        things are merely those which are referred to the class of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">material cause</span>. In regard to this
        it must be said that they took the four conditions of matter which seem
        to belong to the notion of a principle. For, (1) that of which a thing
        is <span style="font-weight: bold">composed</span> seems to be a
        principle of that thing. But matter is such a thing; for we say that a
        thing that has matter is of its matter, as a knife is of iron. (2) That
        <span style="font-weight: bold">from which</span> a thing comes to be,
        being also a principle of the process of generation of that thing, seems
        to be one of its causes, because a thing comes into being by way of
        generation. But a thing first comes to be from matter, because the
        matter of things precedes their production. And a thing does not come
        from matter in an accidental way; for a thing is generated in an
        accidental way from its contrary or privation, as when we say that white
        comes from black. (3) Third, that
        <span style="font-weight: bold">into which</span> all things are
        ultimately dissolved by corruption seems to be a principle of things.
        For just as principles are first in the process of generation, in a
        similar way they are last in the process of dissolution; and obviously
        this too pertains to matter. (4) Fourth, since a principle must remain
        in existence, then that which
        <span style="font-weight: bold">remains throughout</span> the process of
        generation and corruption seems to be a principle. Now the matter which
        they said is the substance of a thing remains throughout every
        transmutation, although its attributes, such as its form and everything
        that accrues to it over and above its material substance, are changed.
        From all these considerations they concluded that matter is the element
        and principle of all beings.
      </p>
      <p><i>Without material cause, no generation or corruption</i></p>
      <p>75. <b>And for this reason</b> (37).</p>
      <p>
        Then he gives, as a secondary point, what they held as following from
        the above, namely, that in the world nothing is generated or corrupted
        in an absolute sense. For when some change occurs with regard to a
        thing’s attributes, and its substance remains unchanged, we do not say
        that it is generated or corrupted in an absolute sense, but only in a
        qualified one; for example, when Socrates becomes good or musical, we do
        not say that he simply comes to be, but comes to be this. And similarly
        when he loses a state of this kind, we do not say that he is corrupted
        in an absolute sense, but only in a qualified one. But matter, which is
        the substance of things according to them, always remains; and every
        change affects some of a thing’s accidents, such as its attributes. From
        this they concluded that nothing is generated or corrupted in an
        absolute sense, but only in a qualified one.
      </p>
      <p>
        76. Yet even though they all agreed on this point, in positing a
        material cause, nevertheless they differed in their position in two
        respects: first, with respect to the number of material causes, because
        some held that there is one, and others many; and second, with respect
        to its nature, because some held that it is fire, others water, and so
        on. Similarly, among those who posited many material causes, some
        assigned certain ones as the material principles of things, and some the
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        77. <span style="font-weight: bold">Thales, the originator</span> (38).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he begins to give the opinions of each of the philosophers about
        the material cause. First, he gives the opinions of those who posited
        one material cause; and second (88), the opinions of those who posited
        many (“Empedocles”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he gives the
        opinions of those who claimed that water is the principle of all things;
        second (86), he gives the opinion of those who made air the principle of
        things (“Anaximenes”); and third (87), the opinion of those who claimed
        that fire is the principle of things (“Hippasus”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he gives the opinion
        of Thales, who said that water is the principle of things; and second
        (79), the reason for this opinion (“For presumably”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says then that Thales, the originator of this kind of philosophy,
        i.e., speculative philosophy, said that water is the first principle of
        all things. Thales is said to have been the originator of speculative
        philosophy because he was the only one of the seven wise men, who came
        after the theological poets, to make an investigation into the causes of
        things, the other sages being concerned with moral matters. The names of
        the seven wise men are as follows. The first was Thales of Miletus, who
        lived during the time of Romulus and when Achaz, King of Israel, was
        reigning over the Hebrews. The second was Pittacus of Mitylene, who
        lived when Sedecias was reigning over the Hebrews and when Tarquinius
        Priscus was reigning over the Romans. The other five sages were Solon of
        Athens, Chilo of Lacedaemon, Periander of Corinth, Cleobulus of Lydia,
        and Bias of Prienne, all of whom lived during the period of the
        Babylonian captivity. Hence, since Thales alone among these men
        investigated the natures of things and distinguished himself by
        committing his arguments to writing, he is described here as the
        originator of this science.
      </p>
      <p>
        78. Nor should it be thought unfitting if he touches here on the
        opinions of those who have treated only the philosophy of nature;
        because according to the ancients, who knew no other substance except
        the corporeal and mobile, it was necessary that first philosophy be the
        philosophy of nature, as is stated in Book IV. And from this position
        Thales next adopted this one, that the earth rests upon water, as
        anything having a principle is based on its principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        79. <span style="font-weight: bold">For presumably he took</span> (39).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the reasons by which Thales could be led to the above
        position. First, he shows how he was led to this position by his own
        reasoning; and second (82), by the authority of his predecessors
        (“Moreover, there are some”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now he was led by two lines of reasoning; one is taken from the cause
        itself of a thing, and the other from a consideration of the generation
        of things (“And on the fact”). Therefore these premises are related. For
        the second follows from the first, because that which is a principle of
        being of other things is also the first principle from which things are
        generated. The third follows from the second, because by corruption each
        thing is dissolved into that from which it was generated. The fourth
        follows from the second and the third; for that which precedes the
        generation of things and remains after they have been corrupted must
        always remain in being.
      </p>
      <p>
        80. In the first line of reasoning he uses three indications to show
        that water is the principle of being of things. The first of these is
        that the nutriment of living things must be moist. But living things
        derive nourishment and being from the same principle; and thus moisture
        appears to be the principle of being of things. The second indication is
        that the being of any physical thing, and especially of a living one, is
        conserved by its proper and natural heat. But heat seems to be generated
        from moisture, since moisture itself is in a sense the matter of heat.
        Hence from this it appears that moisture is a principle of being of
        things. The third indication is that animal life depends on moisture.
        Hence an animal dies as a result of its natural moisture being dried up
        and is kept in existence as a result of its moisture being preserved.
        But in living things to live is to be. Hence it is also evident from
        this that moisture is a principle of being of things. These three
        indications also have a natural connection with one another. For an
        animal is nourished by moisture, because its natural heat is sustained
        by moisture. And from these two it follows that animal life is always
        due to moisture. But that from which a thing comes to be, i.e., from
        which a thing gets its being, is a principle of everything that derives
        being from it. And for this reason he adopted this opinion that moisture
        is the principle of all things.
      </p>
      <p>
        81. In a similar way he also draws an indication of this from the
        generation of things, because the processes of generation of living
        things, which are the noblest of [natural] beings, come from seed. But
        the seed or spermata of all living things have a moist nature. Hence
        from this it also appears that moisture is a principle of generation of
        things. Again, if we add to all of the above points the fact that water
        is the principle of moisture, it follows that water is the first
        principle of things.

        82. <span style="font-weight: bold">Moreover, there are</span> (40).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he shows how Thales was led to the above position by the authority
        of the ancients. He says that prior to Thales and many years before the
        men of Aristotle’s time there were some men, the first to speculate
        about the gods, who seem to have held this opinion about nature, namely,
        that water is the principle of all things.
      </p>
      <p>
        83. With a view to making this clear, we must bear in mind that among
        the Greeks the first who were famous for their learning were certain
        theological poets, so called because of the songs which they wrote about
        the gods. These poets, who were three in number, Orpheus, Museus and
        Linus, of whom Orpheus was the more famous, lived during the time when
        the judges ruled over the Jewish people. Hence it is dear that they
        lived long before Thales and much longer before Aristotle, who lived
        during the time of Alexander. These poets dealt to some extent with the
        nature of things by means of certain figurative representations in
        myths. For they said that Oceanus [i.e., the ocean], where the greatest
        aggregation of waters is found, and Tethys, which is the name they gave
        to the goddess of the waters, are the parents of generation, implying by
        this, under the form of a myth, that water is the principle of
        generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        84. They cloaked this view in another fabulous story, saying that the
        oath or vow of the gods was by a certain body of water, which the poets
        call Styx and describe as an underground swamp. And when they said that
        the gods swore by water, they implied that water was nobler than the
        gods themselves, because an oath or vow is taken on what is most
        honorable. Now that which is prior is more honorable; for the perfect is
        prior absolutely to the imperfect, both in nature and in time, although
        in a particular being imperfection is prior temporally to perfection.
        Hence, from this it is evident that they thought that water is prior to
        the gods themselves, whom they thought to be celestial bodies. And since
        these earliest thinkers said that water is the principle of things, if
        there was any opinion about natural bodies prior to theirs, we do not
        know what it was. Thus what Thales is said to have thought about the
        first cause of things is now clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        85. A certain philosopher named Hippo was not credited with adding
        anything to those mentioned because of the imperfection of his knowledge
        or understanding. Hence, in <i>The Soul</i>, Hippo is placed among the
        ruder [thinkers]; for in that work it is stated that Hippo, basing his
        argument on the seeds of things, as was said here of Thales, held water
        to be the soul and principle of things. Hence it is clear that he adds
        nothing to Thales’ view. Or the statement can mean that, since he spoke
        imperfectly, he did not make himself worthy to have his doctrine
        included here with the others.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Anaxinienes and Diogenes</span> (41).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the opinions of those who held that air is the principle
        of things, namely, Diogenes and Anaximenes, who held that air is
        naturally prior to water and is the principle of all simple bodies,
        i.e., of the four elements, and thus of all other things. Anaximenes is
        the third philosopher after Thales and the disciple of Anaximander, who
        was the disciple of Thales; and Diogenes is said to have been the
        disciple of Anaximenes. Yet there is this difference between the opinion
        of Diogenes and that of Anaximenes: Artaximenes held that air is the
        principle of things in an absolute sense, whereas Diogenes said that air
        could be the principle of things only if it possessed a divine nature.
        From this comes the opinion which is touched on in <i>The Soul</i>, Book
        I. Now the reason why he held that air is the principle of things could
        be taken from the process of respiration, by which the life of animals
        is conserved, and because the processes whereby things are generated and
        corrupted seem to be modified as a result of changes in the air.

      </p>
      <p>
        Here he states that the two philosophers, Hippasus and Heraclitus, held
        that fire is the material principle of things. And they could have been
        influenced by its subtileness, as is said below.
      </p>
      <p>88. <span style="font-weight: bold">Empedocles</span> (43).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the opinions of those who posited many material
        principles. First, he gives the opinion of Empedocles, who held that
        there are a limited number of such principles; and second 90), that of
        Anaxagoras, who held that there are an infinite number (“Anaxagoras”).
      </p>
      <p>
        First (43), he gives Empedocles’ opinion regarding the three elements
        mentioned above, water, air, and fire, which he says are the principles
        of things, adding to them a fourth, earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        89. Second, he gives Empedocles’ opinion about the permanence of these
        elements; for, like those who hold that there is one material cause, he
        holds that these elements always remain and are neither generated nor
        corrupted. However, he said that other things are generated from and
        dissolved into these elements according as a greater or smaller number
        of them are combined or separated out, i.e., inasmuch as these four are
        united by the process of combination and lose their unity by the process
        of separation.
      </p>
      <p>90. <span style="font-weight: bold">Anaxagoras</span> (44).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the opinion of Anaxagoras, who was the other disciple of
        Anaximenes and the classmate of Diogenes. A native of Clazomenae, he was
        prior to Empedocles in years but later in his activity or work, either
        because he began to philosophize later, or because his explanation of
        the number of principles is less satisfactory than that of Empedocles.
        For he said that there are an infinite number of material principles,
        whereas it is better to take a limited and smaller number, as Empedocles
        did, as is stated in Book I of the <i>Physics</i>. For Anaxagoras not
        only said that fire, water, and the other elements are the principles of
        things, as Empedocles did, but also claimed that all things having like
        parts, such as flesh, bones, marrow and so forth, whose smallest parts
        are infinite in number, are the principles of things. For he claimed
        that in each being there are an infinite number of parts of each type of
        thing, because he found that in the case of inferior things one of these
        can be generated from another. He said, in fact, that things could be
        generated only by being separated out from a mixture, as Aristotle has
        explained more fully in the <i>Physics</i>, Book I.
      </p>
      <p>
        91. Second, Anaxagoras also agrees with Empedocles on this point,
        namely, that things are generated and corrupted only insofar as the
        parts of these infinite principles are combined or separated out, and
        that if this were not the case nothing would be generated or corrupted.
        But he said that the infinite number of principles of this kind, from
        which the substances of things are produced, always remain in being.
      </p>
      <p>
        92. From the opinions of these philosophers, then, Aristotle concludes
        that the only cause which these men recognized was the one which belongs
        to the class of material cause.<br />

        45. But as men proceeded in this way, reality itself again opened up a
        path and forced them to make investigations. For if every process of
        generation and corruption is from some one thing or more than one, why
        does this occur, and what is the cause? For certainly the subject itself
        does not cause itself to change. I mean, for example, that neither wood
        nor bronze is the cause of the change undergone by either one of them;
        for wood does not produce a bed, or bronze a statue, but something else
        is the cause of the change. But to seek this is to seek another
        principle, as if one were to say that from which the beginning of motion
        comes.
      </p>
      <p>
        46. Now in general those who have taken such a course from the very
        beginning, and who said that the subject is one, created no difficulty
        for themselves when they said that everything is one. [But some of those
        who say that it is one ], being baffled, so to speak, by this question,
        say that this [one subject] and the whole of nature is immobile not only
        with respect to generation and
      </p>
      <p>
        corruption (for this is an ancient opinion and one which all men confess
        to be true), but also with respect to every other change. This opinion
        is peculiar to them. Hence, of those who said that the [universe] itself
        is one, it occurred to none of them to conceive of such a cause, except
        perhaps Parmenides, and to him only insofar as he claims that there is
        not one cause but also in a sense two causes. But for those who make the
        elements of things many, such as the hot and cold, or fire and earth, a
        better explanation is possible, because they use fire as if it were a
        material principle which is active in nature, but water and earth and
        the like they use in the opposite way.
      </p>
      <p>
        47. After these men and such principles, as if they were insufficient to
        generate the natures of existing things, men were again compelled (as we
        said [45]) by the truth itself to seek for the next principle. For
        perhaps it is unlikely that either fire or earth or anything else of
        this kind should be the cause of the good dispositions of things which
        are or come to be; nor was it consistent that they should think this to
        be the case. Nor again would it be right to attribute so important a
        matter to chance occurrence and fortune.
      </p>
      <p>
        48. And when someone said that there is one intellect present in nature
        as in animals, and that this is the cause of the world and the
        arrangement of the whole, he seemed to atone for the untenable
        statements made by his predecessors.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know that Anaxagoras expressed these views, although Hermotimus of
        Clazomenae was the first to speak of such a cause. Those, therefore, who
        held these opinions likewise posited a principle in existing things
        which is the cause of their goodness, and that sort of cause which is
        the source of motion in the world.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">Chapter 4</p>
      <p>
        49. Now someone might have suspected that Hesiod was the first to have
        investigated this sort of cause, or anyone else who held that love or
        desire is a principle in existing things, as Parmenides did. For in the
        place where he attempts to explain the generation of the universe, he
        says that “Love, the first of all the gods, was made.” And Hesiod says
        that “The first of all things to be made was chaos, then broad earth,
        and love, who is pre-eminent among the immortals”—as though there must
        be in the world some cause which moves things and brings them together.
        How one must arrange these thinkers in sequence will be decided later
        on.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        93. Having given the philosophers opinions about the material cause,
        Aristotle now gives their opinions about the efficient cause, which is
        the source of motion. This is divided into two parts. First, he gives
        the opinion of those who assigned without qualification a cause of
        motion and generation. Second (97), he examines the opinion of those who
        posited an efficient cause, which is also the principle of good and evil
        in the world (“After these men”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he gives the reasoning
        which compelled them to posit an efficient cause. Second (94), he shows
        the different positions which different men have held regarding this
        (“Now in general”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says (45), then, that some philosophers have proceeded in this way in
        positing a material cause, but that the very nature of reality clearly
        provided them with a course for understanding or discovering the truth,
        and compelled them to investigate a problem which led them to the
        efficient cause. This problem is as follows: no thing or subject changes
        itself; for example, wood does not change itself so that a bed comes
        from it, nor does bronze cause itself to be changed in such a way that a
        statue comes from it; but there must be some other principle which
        causes the change they undergo, and this is the artist. But those who
        posited a material cause, whether one or more than one, said that the
        generation and corruption of things come from this cause as a subject.
        Therefore there must be some other cause of change, and to seek this is
        to seek another class of principle and cause, which is called the source
        of motion.
      </p>
      <p>94. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now in general</span> (46).</p>
      <p>
        He shows here that the philosophers have adopted three positions with
        respect to the foregoing issue. For those who adopted this course from
        the very beginning, and said that there is one material cause, were not
        greatly concerned with the solution of this problem. For they were
        content with their view of matter and neglected the cause of motion
        altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        95. But others, who said that all things are one, being defeated as it
        were by this issue, as they were unable to go so far as to assign a
        cause of motion, denied motion altogether. Hence they said that the
        whole universe is one immobile being. In this respect they differed from
        the first philosophers of nature, who said that one cause is the
        substance of all things although it is moved by rarefaction and
        condensation, so that in this way many things come to be in some measure
        from one principle. However, they did not say that this principle is
        subject to generation and corruption in an absolute sense. For the view
        that nothing was generated or corrupted without qualification is an
        ancient one admitted by all of them, as is clear from what was said
        above (75). But it was peculiar to these later thinkers to say that the
        whole of reality is one immobile being, devoid of every kind of motion.
        These men were Parmenides and Melissus, as will be explained below
        (138). Hence it is evident that it was impossible for those who said
        that the whole is one immobile being to conceive of “such a cause,”
        i.e., a cause of motion. For, by the very fact that they did away with
        motion, they sought in vain for a cause of motion. An exception was
        Parmenides; for even though he held that there is only one thing
        according to reason, he held that there are many things according to the
        senses, as will be stated below (101). Hence, inasmuch as Parmenides
        held that there are many things, it was in keeping with his position to
        hold that there are many causes, one of which would be a mover and the
        others something moved. For just as he held that there are many things
        according to the senses, in a similar way it was necessary for him to
        hold that there is motion according to the senses, because a plurality
        of things can be understood to be produced from one subject only by some
        kind of motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        96. Third, there were those who, in making the substances of things
        many, assented to the aforesaid reasoning by positing a cause of motion.
        For they maintained that the hot or the cold, i.e., fire or earth, are
        causes; and of these they used fire as having a mobile, i.e., an active,
        nature, but water, earth and air they used in the opposite way, i.e., as
        having a passive nature. Thus fire was a sort of efficient cause, but
        the others a sort of material cause.
      </p>
      <p>97. <span style="font-weight: bold">After these men</span> (47).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the opinion of those who posited an efficient cause, not
        only as a principle of motion, but also as a principle of good and evil
        in things. In regard to this he does two things. First, he expounds
        their views. Second (107), he shows in what respect they failed in
        assigning the causes of things (“These thinkers”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he gives the reasons
        for their position by which they were induced to posit another cause
        besides the foregoing one. Second (100), he shows how they posited this
        kind of cause in different ways (“And when someone”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says first, then, that after the foregoing philosophers who held that
        there is only one material cause, or many bodies, one of which was
        active and the others passive, and after the other first principles
        given by them, men were again compelled by the truth itself ‘ “as we
        have said,” i.e., as was stated above (93), to seek the “next”
        principle, i.e., the one which naturally follows the foregoing one,
        namely, the cause of good, which is really the final cause, although it
        was held by them only incidentally, as will be see below (177). For they
        held that there is a cause of goodness in things only after the manner
        of an efficient cause. They were compelled to do this because the
        foregoing principles were not sufficient to account for the generation
        of the natural world, in which some things are found to be well
        disposed. The fact that bodies are conserved in their proper places and
        are corrupted outside of them proves this; and so do the benefits
        resulting from the parts of animals, which are found to be disposed in
        this manner according as this is in keeping with an animal’s good state
        of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        98. But neither fire nor earth nor any such bodies were held to be
        adequate causes of this kind of good disposition or state of being which
        some things already have but others acquire by some kind of production.
        For these bodies act in one definite way according to the necessity of
        their proper forms, as fire heats things and tends upward, and water
        cools things and tends downward. But the aforesaid benefits and good
        states of being of things must have a cause which is not limited to one
        effect only, since the parts of different animals are found to be
        disposed in different ways, and in each one insofar as it is in keeping
        with its nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        99. Hence, it is not reasonable that fire or earth or the like should be
        the cause of the aforesaid good state of being which things have, nor
        was it reasonable that these men should have thought this to be the
        case. Nor again would it be reasonable to say that these things are
        chance occurrences, i.e., that they are accidental or come about by
        chance, and that their causality is changed only fortuitously; although
        some of these thinkers had said this, as Empedocles and all those who
        posited a material cause, as is evident in Book II of the Physics.
        However, this is also seen to be false by reason of the fact that good
        dispositions of this kind are found either always or for the most part,
        whereas things that come about by chance or fortune do not occur always
        or for the most part but seldom. For this reason, then, it was necessary
        to discover besides the four elements some other principle which would
        account for the good dispositions of things. Another text has “Nor would
        it be right that these should be attributed to chance occurrence and
        fortune,” but this means the same as the above.

      </p>
      <p>
        He says, then, that after the foregoing doctrine someone appeared who
        said that there is an intellect present in nature at large, just as
        there is in animals, and that this is the cause of the world and the
        order of the whole, i.e., of the universe, in which order the good of
        the entire universe and that of every single part consists. And this man
        atoned for the first philosophers by reducing to pure truth those who
        said unreasonable things and did not mention this kind of cause. Now
        Anaxagoras clearly stated this doctrine, although another philosopher
        —Hermotimus of Clazomenae—first gave him the idea of proposing this
        opinion. Hence it is evident that those who held this opinion claimed at
        the same time that the principle by which things are well disposed and
        the one which is the source of motion in things, are one and the same.
      </p>
      <p>101. <b>Now someone might</b> (49).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the opinion of those who claimed that
        <span style="font-weight: bold">love</span> is the first principle,
        although they did not hold this very explicitly or clearly. Accordingly,
        he says that some suspected that Hesiod had sought for such a principle
        to account for the good disposition of things, or anyone else who
        posited love or desire in nature. For when Parmenides attempted to
        explain the generation of the universe, he said that in the establishing
        of the universe “Love, the first of all the gods, was made.” Nor is this
        opposed to his doctrine that there is one immobile being, of which
        Aristotle speaks here; because this man held that there are many things
        according to the senses, although there is only one thing according to
        reason, as was stated above and will be stated below. Moreover, he
        called the celestial bodies, or perhaps certain separate substances,
        gods.
      </p>
      <p>
        102. But Hesiod said that first of all there was chaos, and then broad
        earth was made, to be the receptacle of everything else; for it is
        evident that the receptacle [or void] and place are principles, as is
        stated in Book IV of the <i>Physics</i>. And he also held that love,
        which instructs all the immortals, is a principle of things. He did this
        because the communication of goodness seems to spring from love, for a
        good deed is a sign and effect of love. Hence, since corruptible things
        derive their being and every good disposition from immortal beings of
        this kind, this must be attributed to the love of the immortals.
        Furthermore, he held that the immortals are either the celestial bodies
        themselves, or material principles themselves. Thus he posited chaos and
        love as though there had to be in existing things not only a material
        cause of their motions, but also an efficient cause which moves and
        unites them, which seems to be the office of love. For love moves us to
        act, because it is the source of all the emotions, since fear, sadness
        and hope proceed only from love. That love unites things is clear from
        this, that love itself is a certain union between the lover and the
        thing loved, seeing that the lover regards the beloved as himself. This
        man Hesiod is to be numbered among the poets who lived before the time
        of the philosophers.
      </p>
      <p>
        103. Now, as to which one of these thinkers is prior, i.e., more
        competent in knowledge, whether the one who said that love is the first
        principle, or the one who said hat intellect is, can be decided later
        on, that is, where God is discussed. He calls this decision an
        arrangement, because the degree of excellence belonging to each man is
        allotted to him in this way. Another translation states this more
        clearly: “Therefore, in what order it is fitting to go over these
        thinkers, and who in this order is prior, can be decided later on.”<br />

        50. But since there would seem to be in nature things which are contrary
        to those that are good, and not only order and good but also disorder
        and what is base, and evil things more numerous than good ones, and base
        things more numerous than noble ones, for this reason another thinker
        introduced love and strife as causes, each of its own type of effects.
        For if anyone grasps what Empedocles said, taking it according to its
        meaning rather than according to its faltering expression, he will find
        that love is the cause of things which come to be by aggregation, and
        strife the cause of evil things. Hence, if anyone were to say that
        Empedocles, in a sense, both said and was the first to say that good and
        evil are princip es, he would perhaps speak correctly, i.e., if the
        cause of all good things is good and that of all evil things is evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        51. These thinkers, then, as we have said, to this extent have touched
        on two of the causes which we established in the <i>Physics</i>,—matter
        and the source of motion—though only obscurely and with no clarity, much
        as untrained men conduct themselves in battle. For the latter, though
        encircled, often deal telling blows, but without science. In the same
        way these thinkers do not seem to be aware of what they are saying. For
        it seems that they almost never make use of the causes except to a small
        degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        52. Anaxagoras uses “intellect” in an artificial way in generating the
        world. For when he is in difficulty as to what is necessarily the cause
        of something, he drags in this intellect; but in other cases he makes
        everything but intellect the cause of what comes to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        53. Empedocles, it is true, makes greater use of causes than Anaxagoras,
        though not sufficiently; nor does one find in his use of them what he
        professed. In many places he argues that love separates things, and that
        strife brings them together. For when being itself is separated into its
        elements by strife, then fire and each of the other elements are brought
        together into a unity. But when they are united by love, the particles
        must again be separated out from each element.
      </p>
      <p>
        54. In contrast to the first philosophers, then, Empedocles was the
        first to introduce this cause, dividing it in such a way as to make the
        source of motion not a single principle but different and contrary ones.
        Moreover, he was the first to claim that the elements, which are said to
        belong to the class of matter, are four in number, although he does not
        use them as four but as two, taking fire by itself alone, and its
        opposites—earth, air, and water—as a single nature (46).
      </p>
      <p>
        But anyone may see this by studying his basic sayings. This philosopher,
        then, as we have said, has spoken in this way about the principles of
        things and their number.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        104. Here Aristotle gives the opinion of those who posited contrariety
        in beings of this kind, and the reason which moved them, which is as
        follows. There would seem to be in nature things which are contrary to
        those that are good, because in nature one finds not only things which
        are ordered and good, but sometimes things which are disordered and
        base. Now it cannot be said that evil things have no cause but happen by
        chance, because evil things are more numerous than good ones, and base
        things more numerous than those which are unqualifiedly noble. But those
        things which come to be by chance without a definite cause do not occur
        for the most part but in the smaller number of cases. Hence, since
        contrary effects have contrary causes, it was necessary to hold as a
        cause of things not only love, from which the order and good in things
        originate, but also hate, which is the source of disorder and baseness
        or evil in things, so that in this way particular instances of evil and
        good have their own type of causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        105. That this was the reason which moved Empedocles is evident if
        anyone grasps what he says, taking his statement according to its
        meaning rather than according to the words which he used imperfectly
        and, as it were, in a faltering way. For he said that it is the office
        of love to bring the elements together, and of hate to separate them.
        But since the generation of things is a result of the coming together
        [of the elements], by reason of which there is being and good in things,
        and their corruption a result of the separation [of the elements], which
        is the way to non-being and evil, it is now evident that he wanted love
        to be the cause of things which come to be by aggregation, i.e., of good
        things, and hate the cause of evil things. Thus if one were to say that
        Empedocles was the first to maintain that good and evil are principles,
        he would perhaps speak correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        106. That is to say, this would follow if Empedocles did hold that good
        is the cause of all good things, and evil the cause of all evil things.
        For it is evident that he posited evil as the cause of some evil things,
        namely, of corruption, and good as the cause of some good things,
        namely, of generation. But because it would not follow that all good
        things would be caused by friendship or all evil things by hate, since
        the parts of the world would be differentiated by hate and fused
        together by friendship, therefore he did not always hold that good is
        the cause of good things, and evil the cause of evil things.
      </p>
      <p>107. <span style="font-weight: bold">These thinkers</span> (51).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that in giving these causes the philosophers treated them
        inadequately. First, he mentions them in a general way. Second (108), he
        treats each one individually (“Anaxagoras”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says first, then, that these philosophers—Anaxagoras and
        Empedocles—arrived at a doctrine of two of the causes which have been
        established in the <i>Physics</i>, namely, matter and the cause of
        motion, although they treated these obscurely and with no clarity,
        because they did not explain that those principles which they held to be
        the causes of things could be reduced to these classes of causes. But
        insofar as they posited two of these causes, they may be likened to
        untrained warriors who, ttiough encircled by the enemy, sometimes strike
        good blows, not by art but by chance. This is evident from the fact
        that, even though they happen to do this sometimes, this does not occur
        always or for the most part. In like manner, too, these philosophers
        were not accustomed to express themselves accurately, nor was it their
        custom to speak with awareness, i.e., as men who know. Hence another
        translation has, “But these men neither have science, nor are they to be
        compared with men who realize what they are saying.” This is shown by
        the fact that, although they had proposed these causes, they hardly ever
        used them, because they employed them in few instances. Hence it seems
        that they introduced them not as a result of art but by accident,
        because they were moved to, do so by necessity.
      </p>
      <p>108. <span style="font-weight: bold">Anaxagoras</span> (52).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows in what particular respect the view of each is
        unsatisfactory. First, he speaks of Anaxagoras; and second (109), of
        Empedocles (“Empedocles”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says first, then, that Anaxagoras uses “intellect” to generate the
        world, and in so doing he seems to speak of it in an artificial way. For
        when he inquires about the causes of the world’s generation, he drags it
        in of necessity, i.e., he invents this intelligence only because he is
        unable to attribute the generation of the world to any other cause which
        would differentiate things except to one which is essentially distinct
        and unmixed, and intellect is a thing of this kind. But in all other
        cases he draws his causes from any other source rather than intellect,
        for example, in the case of the particular natures of things.
      </p>
      <p>109. <b>Empedocles</b> (53).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows in what respect Empedocles’ doctrine is inadequate; and in
        regard to this he does two things. First, he shows in what respect
        Empedocles’ doctrine is inadequate. Second (111), he explains what
        Empedocles himself held in contrast to the other philosophers (“In
        contrast”)
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first (53), that Empedocles, in dealing with the particular
        natures of things, “makes greater use of the causes” posited by him (the
        four elements, and love and hate) than Anaxagoras did, because he
        reduced the generation and corruption of particular things to these
        causes, and not to intelligence as Anaxagoras did. But Empedocles failed
        in two ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, he failed because he does not treat causes of this kind
        adequately enough; for he uses things which are not self-evident as
        though they were self-evident axioms, as is stated in the
        <i>Physics</i>, Book W that is, insofar as he assumed that they are
        self-evident, because at one definite time strife has dominion over the
        elements and at another, love.
      </p>
      <p>
        110. Second, he failed because in the matters which he investigates, one
        does not find what he has professed, i.e., what he held as a principle,
        namely, that love combines things and that strife separates them,
        because in many places love must on the contrary “separate” or divide
        things, and strife “bring them together,” i.e., unite them. For when the
        universe itself “is separated out,” i.e., divided into its parts, by
        hate, as occurs when the world is generated, all particles of fire are
        then combined into one whole, and so also are the individual particles
        of the other elements “brought together,” i.e., joined to each other.
        Hence, strife not only separates the particles of fire from those of
        air, but also brings together the particles of fire. But, on the other
        hand, when the elements come together through love, which occurs when
        the universe is destroyed the particles of fire must then be separated
        from each other, and so also must the particles of the other elements.
        For fire can be mixed with air only if the particles of fire are
        separated from each other; and the same is true of the particles of air
        only if these elements penetrate one another, so that love not only
        unites unlike things but also separates like things, according to what
        follows from his position.
      </p>
      <p>111. <span style="font-weight: bold">In contrast</span> (54).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows in what respect Empedocles’ own doctrine differs from that
        of the other philosophers. He says that Empedocles maintained two things
        in contrast to the others. First, he divided the cause which is the
        source of motion into two contrary parts. Second, he held the material
        cause to be constituted of four elements—not that he uses the four
        elements as four, but rather as two, because he contrasts fire with the
        other three, saying that fire is active in nature and the others passive
        in nature. Anyone can gather this from the elements of things treated by
        him, or from his “basic sayings” in the sense of the rudiments of the
        doctrine which he propounded. Another version reads “from his verses,”
        because he is said to have written his philosophy in meters. And still
        another version, which says “from his statements,” agrees with this. As
        has been stated, then, this philosopher was the first to stipulate in
        this way that the principles of things are so many in number, namely,
        four, and to speak of those which have been mentioned.<br />

        55. Leucippus and his colleague Democritus say that the elements of
        things are the full and the void, calling the one being and the other
        non-being. For this reason they say that the full or solid is being, and
        the void, non-being. For this reason too they say that being no more
        <i>is</i> than non-being, because the void no more <i>is</i> than body;
        and they hold that these are the material causes of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        56. And just as those who make the underlying substance one generate
        other things from this by means of its attributes, holding that rarity
        and density are the principles of these attributes, in the same way
        these men say that the differences [of the atoms] are the causes of
        other things. These differences, they say, are three: shape,
        arrangement, and position. For they claim that what exists differs only
        by rhythm, inter-contact, and turning; and of these rhythm means shape,
        inter-contact arrangement, and turning position. For A differs from N in
        shape, and Z from N in position. But with regard to motion, from whence
        it comes or how it is present in things, these men carelessly dismissed
        this question as the other thinkers did. As we have said before, then,
        these two types of causes seem to have been investigated to this extent
        by the first thinkers.

        57. But during the time of these and prior to them, lived the group
        called the Pythagoreans who dealt with mathematics and were the first to
        develop it; and having been brought up in these sciences, they thought
        that their principles were the principles of all things. But since among
        these principles numbers are naturally first, they thought they saw in
        numbers, more than in fire and earth, many resemblances to things which
        are and come to be, because [according to them] this attribute of
        numbers is justice, another is soul and mind, and still another is
        opportunity. The case is the same, so to speak, with every other thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        58. Moreover, since they considered the attributes and ratios of
        harmonies in terms of numbers, and since other things in their whole
        nature seemed to be likened to numbers, and since numbers are the first
        things in the whole of nature, they thought that the elements of numbers
        are the elements of all things, and that the whole heaven is a harmony
        and number. And whatever they had revealed in the case of numbers and
        harmonies [which they could] show [to be in agreement] with the motions
        and parts of the heavens, and its whole arrangement, they collected and
        adapted to these. And if anything was lacking anywhere, they called it
        in in order that their undertaking might be complete. I mean that since
        the number ten seems to be the perfect number and to comprise the whole
        nature of numbers, they said that the bodies which move in the heavens
        are ten in number; but as only nine are observable they therefore
        invented a tenth, the counter-earth. These things have been dealt with
        more exactly in another work [ <i>De Coelo</i>, II, 13].

        112. Here he begins to give the positions of those who held strange and
        obscure views about the principles of things. First, he gives the
        position of those who held that there are many principles of things; and
        second (134) the position of those who held that there is only one being
        (“But there are some”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he gives the opinion
        of Leucippus and Democritus, who held that the principles of things are
        corporeal. Second (119), he gives the opinion of the Pythagoreans, who
        held that the principles of things are incorporeal entities (“But during
        the time”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he gives the opinion
        of Democritus and Leucippus about the material cause of things; and
        second (115), their opinion about the cause of diversity, that is, how
        matter is differentiated into many things. In this discussion the cause
        of the generation and corruption of things also becomes evident; and
        this is a point on which these men agreed with the ancient philosophers
        (“And just as those who”). He says, then, that two philosophers,
        Democritus and Leucippus, who are called friends because they followed
        each other in all things, held that the principles of things are the
        full and the void or empty, of which the full is being, and the void or
        empty, non-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        113. Now in order to clarify this opinion we must recall what the
        Philosopher says in Book I of <i>Generation</i>, where he treats it more
        fully. For certain philosophers had held that everything is one
        continuous immobile being, because it seems that there cannot be motion
        without a void, or any distinction between things, as they said. And
        though they could not comprehend the privation of continuity, by reason
        of which bodies must be understood to be differentiated, except by means
        of a void, they claimed that the void existed in no way. Democritus, who
        came after them, and who agreed with their reasoning but was unable to
        exclude diversity and motion from things, held that the void existed,
        and that all bodies are composed of certain indivisible bodies [i.e.,
        the atoms]. He did this because it seemed to him that no reason could be
        given why the whole of being should be divided in one part rather than
        another. And lest he should hold that the whole of being is continuous,
        he therefore chose to maintain that this whole is divided everywhere and
        in its entirety; and this could not be the case if anything divisible
        remained undivided. And according to him indivisible bodies of this kind
        can neither exist nor be joined together except by means of the void.
        For if the void did not come between any two of them, one continuous
        whole would result from the two; which he did not hold for the above
        reason. Hence he said that the continuous quantity of each body is
        constituted both of those indivisible bodies filling indivisible spaces
        and of certain empty spaces, which he called pores, coming between these
        indivisible bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        114. And since the void is non-being and the full is being, it is
        evident from this that he did not hold that a thing was constituted by
        being rather than non-being, because the [indivisible] bodies did not
        constitute things more than the void, or the void more than bodies; but
        he said that a body is composed at once of these two things, as is clear
        in the text. Hence he held that these two things are the causes of
        beings as their matter.
      </p>
      <p>115. <span style="font-weight: bold">And just as those</span> (56).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows in what respect these philosophers agreed with the
        ancients who claimed that there is only one matter. He indicates
        agreement in two respects.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, just as the ancient philosophers held that there is one matter,
        and from that one matter generated something else according to the
        different attributes of matter (i.e., the rare and dense, which they
        accepted as the principles of all other attributes), in a similar way
        these philosophers—Democritus and Leucippus—said that there were
        different causes of different things (namely, of the bodies composed of
        these indivisible bodies), i.e., that different beings were produced as
        a result of certain differences of these indivisible bodies and their
        pores.
      </p>
      <p>
        116. Now they said that these differences are, first, differences in
        shape, which is noted from this that things are angular, circular or
        square; second, differences in arrangement, i.e., insofar as the
        indivisible bodies are prior or subsequent; and, third, differences in
        position, i.e., insofar as these bodies are in front or behind, right or
        left, or above and below. Hence they said that one being differs from
        another “either by rhythm,” which is shape, “or by inter-contact,” which
        is arrangement, “or by turning,” which is position.
      </p>
      <p>
        117. He illustrates this by using the letters of the Greek alphabet,
        which differ from each other in shape just as in our alphabet one letter
        also differs from another; for A differs from N in shape. Again, AN
        differs from NA in arrangement, because one letter is placed before the
        other. And one letter also differs from another in position, as Z from
        IN, just as in our language we also see that semivowels cannot stand
        after liquids preceded by mutes in the same syllable. Therefore, just as
        tragedy and comedy come from the same letters as a result of the letters
        being disposed in different ways because of this threefold difference,
        in a similar fashion different species of things are produced from the
        same indivisible bodies as a result of the latter being disposed in
        different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        118. The second respect in which these philosophers agreed with the
        ancients is this: just as the ancient philosophers neglected to posit a
        cause which accounts for motion in things, so also did these men,
        although they would say that these indivisible bodies are capable of
        self-motion. Thus it is evident that these philosophers mentioned only
        two of the causes, i.e., all of them spoke of the material cause) and
        some of the efficient cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        119.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But during the time of these</span>
        (57).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the opinions of the Pythagoreans, who held that numbers
        are the substances of things. In regard to this he does two things.
        First, he gives their opinions about the substance of things; and second
        (124), their opinions about the principles of things (“But the reason”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he gives two reasons by which they were led to
        assert that numbers are the substances of things. He gives the second
        reason (121) where he says “Moreover, since they considered.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He says that the Pythagoreans were philosophers who lived “during the
        time of these,” i.e., they were contemporaries of some of the foregoing
        philosophers; “and prior to them,” because they preceded some of them.
        Now it must be understood that there were two groups of philosophers.
        One group was called the Ionians, who inhabited the land which is now
        called Greece. This group originated with Thales, as was pointed out
        above (77). The other group of philosophers were the Italians, who lived
        in that part of Italy which was once called Greater Greece and is now
        called Apulia and Calabria. The leader of these philosophers was
        Pythagoras, a native of Samos, so called from a certain city of
        Calabria. These two groups of philosophers lived at the same time, and
        this is why he says that they lived “During the time of these and prior
        to them.”
      </p>
      <p>
        120. These Italian philosophers, also called Pythagoreans, were the
        first to develop certain mathematical entities, so that they said that
        these are the substances and principles of sensible things. He says that
        they were “the first” because the Platonists were their successors. They
        were moved to bring in mathematics because they were brought up in the
        study of these sciences, and therefore they thought that the principles
        of mathematics are the principles of all existing things. For men are
        wont to judge about things in terms of what they already know. And since
        among mathematical entities numbers are first, these men therefore tried
        to see resemblances of natural things, both as regards their being and
        generation, in numbers rather than in the sensible elements—earth, water
        and the like. For just as the foregoing philosophers adapted the
        attributes of sensible things to those of natural things because of a
        certain resemblance which they bear to the properties of fire, water,
        and bodies of this kind, in a similar fashion these mathematicians
        adapted the properties of natural things to the attributes of numbers
        when they said that some one attribute of number is the cause of
        justice, another the cause of soul and intellect, and still another the
        cause of opportunity, and so on for other things. And in this way the
        attributes of numbers are understood to be the intelligible structures
        and principles of all things appearing in the sensible world, both in
        the realm of voluntary matters, signified by justice, and in that of the
        substantial forms of natural things, signified by soul and intellect,
        and in that of accidents, signified by opportunity.
      </p>
      <p><i>STRANGE AND OBSCURE VIEWS ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES OF THINGS</i></p>
      <p><i>Hidden principles: numbers</i></p>
      <p>121. <b>Moreover, since they</b> (58).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second reason which motivated them. For they thought
        of the attributes of harmonies, musical consonants and their ratios,
        i.e., proportions, in terms of the nature of numbers. Hence, since
        harmonious sounds are certain sensible things, they attempted by the
        same reasoning to liken all other sensible things, both in their
        intelligible structure and in their whole nature, to numbers, so that
        numbers are the first things in the whole of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        122. For this reason too they thought that the principles of numbers are
        the principles of all existing things, and they said that the whole
        heaven is merely a kind of nature and harmony of numbers, i.e., a kind
        of numerical proportion similar to the proportion found in harmonies.
        Hence, whatever they had “revealed,” i.e., had shown, which they could
        adapt to numbers and harmonies, they also adapted both to the changes
        undergone by the heavens, as its motion, eclipses and the like; and to
        its parts, as the different orbs; and to the whole arrangement of the
        heavens, as the different stars and different figures in the
        constellations.<br />

      <p>
        59. But the reason we have come [to examine these philosophers] is that
        we may also learn from them what they hold the principles of things to
        be, and how these principles fall under the causes already described.
        Now these men also seem to think that number is the principle of
        existing things both as their matter and as their attributes and states.
        According to them the elements of number are the even and odd, and of
        these the latter is limited and the former, unlimited. The unit is
        composed of both of these, since it is both even and odd, and number is
        derived from the unit. And number, as has been stated (58), constitutes
        the whole heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        60. But other members of the same school say that the principles of
        things are ten in number, which they give as co-elements: the limited
        and unlimited, even and odd, one and many, right and left, masculine and
        feminine, rest and motion, straight and curved, light and darkness, good
        and evil, square and oblong.
      </p>
      <p>
        61. Alcmaeon of Croton seems to have formed his opinion in the same way,
        and either he derived the theory from them or they from him; for
        Alcmaeon (who had reached maturity when Pythagoras was an old man)
        expressed views similar to those of the Pythagoreans. For he says that
        many things in the realm of human affairs are in twos [i.e., pairs],
        calling them contrarieties, not distinguished as these men had
        distinguished them, but such as are taken at random, for example, white
        and black, sweet and bitter, good and evil, small and great. It is true
        that this philosopher threw out vague remarks about the other
        contrarieties, but the Pythagoreans have declared both what the
        contrarieties are and how many there are.
      </p>
      <p>
        62. From both of these, then, we can gather this much, that contraries
        are the principles of existing things; but how many they are and that
        they are these [determinate ones must be learned] from other thinkers.
        The way in which many principles can be brought together under the
        causes described is not clearly expressed by them, although they seem to
        allot their elements to the class of matter; for they say that substance
        is composed and moulded out of these as something inherent. From these
        remarks, then, it is possible to get an adequate understanding of the
        meaning of the ancient philosophers who said that the elements of things
        are many.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        124. Here he states what the Pythagoreans had to say about the
        principles of things. In regard to this he does two things. First, he
        expounds their opinions about the principles of things; and second
        (132), he indicates to what class of cause the principles laid down by
        them are reduced (“From both of these”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he gives three opinions. The second (127) begins
        at the words “But other members”; and the third (131), where he says
        “Alcmaeon of Croton.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He says first (59), then, that the reason he came to examine the
        opinions of the Pythagoreans is that he might show from their opinions
        what the principles of things are and how the principles laid down by
        them fall under the causes given above. For the Pythagoreans seem to
        hold that number is the principle of existing things as matter,1 and
        that the attributes of number are the attributes and states of existing
        things. By “attributes” we mean transient accidents, and by “states,”
        permanent accidents. They also held that the attribute of any number
        according to which any number is said to be even is justice, because of
        the equality of division, since such a number is evenly divided into two
        parts right down to the unit. For example, the number eight is divided
        into two fours, the number four into two twos, and the number two into
        two units. And in a similar way they likened the other accidents of
        things to the accidents of numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        125. in fact, they said that the even and odd, which are the first
        differences of numbers, are the principles of num hers. And they said
        that even number is the principle of unlimitedness and odd number the
        principle of limitation, as is shown in the <i>Physics</i>, Book III,
        because in reality the unlimited seems to result chiefly from the
        division of the continuous. But an even number is capable of division;
        for an odd number includes within itself an even number plus a unit, and
        this makes it indivisible. He also proves this as followswhen odd
        numbers are added to each other successively, they always retain the
        figure of a square, whereas even numbers change their figure. For when
        the number three is added to the unit, which is the principle of
        numbers, the number four results, which is the first square [number],
        because 2 x 2 = 4. Again, when the number five, which is an odd number,
        is added to the number four, the number nine results, which is also a
        square number; and so on with the others. But if the number two, which
        is the first even number, is added to the number one, a triangular
        number results, i.e., the number three. And if the number four, which is
        the second even number, is added to the number three, there results a
        septangular number, i.e., the number seven. And when even numbers are
        added to each other successively in this way, they do not retain the
        same figure. This is why they attributed the unlimited to the even and
        the limited to the odd. And since limitedness pertains to form, to which
        active power belongs, they therefore said that even numbers are
        feminine, and odd numbers, masculine.
      </p>
      <p>
        126. From these two, namely, the even and odd, the limited and
        unlimited, they produced not only number but also the unit itself, i.e.,
        unity. For unity is virtually both even and odd; because all differences
        of number are virtually contained in the unit; for all differences of
        number are reduced to the unit. Hence, in the list of odd numbers the
        unit is found to be the first. And the same is true in the list of even
        numbers, square numbers, and perfect numbers. This is also the case with
        the other differences of number, because even though the unit is not
        actually a number, it is still virtually all numbers. And just as the
        unit is said to be composed of the even and odd, in a similar way number
        is composed of units. In fact, [according to them], the heavens and all
        sensible things are composed of numbers. This was the sequence of
        principles which they gave.
      </p>
      <p>127. <span style="font-weight: bold">But other members</span> (60).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives another opinion which the Pythagoreans held about the
        principles of things. He says that among these same Pythagoreans there
        were some who claimed that there is not just one contrariety in
        principles, as the foregoing did, but ten principles, which are
        presented as co-elements, that is, by taking each of these principles
        with its co-principle, or contrary. The reason for this position was
        that they took not only the first principles but also the proximate
        principles attributed to each class of things. Hence, they posited first
        the limited and the unlimited, as did those who have just been
        mentioned; and subsequently the even and the odd, to which the limited
        and unlimited are attributed. And because the even and odd are the first
        principles of things, and numbers are first produced from them, they
        posited, third, a difference of numbers, namely, the one and the many,
        both of which are produced from the even and the odd. Again, because
        continuous quantities are composed of numbers, inasmuch as they
        understood numbers to have position (for according to them the point was
        merely the unit having position, and the line the number two having
        position), they therefore claimed next that the principles of positions
        are the right and left; for the right is found to be perfect and the
        left imperfect. Therefore the right is determined from the aspect of
        oddness, and the left from the aspect of evenness. But because natural
        bodies have both active and passive powers in addition to mathematical
        extensions, they therefore next maintained that masculine and feminine
        are principles. For masculine pertains to active power, and feminine to
        passive power; and of these masculine pertains to odd number and
        feminine to even number, as has been stated (125).
      </p>
      <p>
        128. Now it is from active and passive power that motion and rest
        originate in the world; and of these motion is placed in the class of
        the unlimited and even, because it partakes of irregularity and
        otherness, and rest in the class of the unlimited and odd. Furthermore,
        the first differences of motions are the circular and straight, so that
        as a consequence of this the straight pertains to even number. Hence
        they said that the straight line is the number two; but that the curved
        or circular line, by reason of its uniformity, pertains to odd number,
        which retains its undividedness because of the form of unity.
      </p>
      <p>
        129. And they not only posited principles to account for the natural
        operations and motions of things, but also to account for the operations
        of living things. In fact, they held that light and darkness are
        principles of knowing, but that good and evil are principles of
        appetite. For light is a principle of knowing, whereas darkness is
        ascribed to ignorance; and good is that to which appetite tends, whereas
        evil is that from which it turns away.
      </p>
      <p>
        130. Again, [according to them] the difference of perfection and
        imperfection is found not only in natural things and in voluntary powers
        and motions, but also in continuous quantities and figures. These
        figures are understood to be something over and above the substances of
        continuous quantities, just as the powers responsible for motions and
        operations are something over and above the substances of natural
        bodies. Therefore with reference to this they held that what is
        quadrangular, i.e., the square and oblong, is a principle. Now a square
        is said to be a figure of four equal sides, whose four angles are right
        angles; and such a figure is produced by multiplying a line by itself.
        Therefore, since it is produced from the unit itself, it belongs to the
        class of odd number. But an oblong is defined as a figure whose angles
        are all right angles and whose opposite sides alone, not all sides, are
        equal to each other. Hence it is clear that, just as a square is
        produced by multiplying one line by itself, in a similar way an oblong
        is produced by multiplying one line by another. Hence it pertains to the
        class of even number, of which the first is the number two.
      </p>
      <p>131. <span style="font-weight: bold">Akmaeon of Croton</span> (61).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third opinion of the Pythagoreans, saying that
        Alcmaeon of Croton, so named from the city in which he was raised, seems
        to maintain somewhat the same view as that expressed by these
        Pythagoreans, namely, that many contraries are the principles of things.
        For either he derives the theory from the Pythagoreans, or they from
        him. That either of these might be true is clear from the fact that he
        was a contemporary of the Pythagoreans, granted that he began to
        philosophize when Pythagoras was an old man. But whichever happens to be
        true, he expressed views similar to those of the Pythagoreans. For he
        said that many of the things “in the realm of human affairs,” i.e., many
        of the attributes of sensible things are arranged in pairs,
        understanding by pairs opposites which are contrary. Yet in this matter
        he differs from the foregoing philosophers, because the Pythagoreans
        said that determinate contraries are the principles of things. But he
        throws them in, as it were, without any order, holding that any of the
        contraries which he happened to think of are the principles of things,
        such as white and black, sweet and bitter, and so on.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        132. <span style="font-weight: bold">From both of these</span> (62).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gathers together from the above remarks what the Pythagoreans
        thought about the principles of things, and how the principles which
        they posited are reduced to some class of cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, then, that from both of those mentioned above, namely, Alcmaeon
        and the Pythagoreans, it is possible to draw one common opinion, namely,
        that the principles of existing things are contraries; which was not
        expressed by the other thinkers. This must be understood with reference
        to the material cause. For Empedocles posited contrariety in the case of
        the efficient cause; and the ancient philosophers of nature posited
        contrary principles, such as rarity and density, although they
        attributed contrariety to form. But even though Empedocles held that the
        four elements are material principles, he still did not claim that they
        are the first material principles by reason of contrariety but because
        of their natures and substance. These men, however, attributed
        contrariety to matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        133. The nature of the contraries posited by these men is evident from
        the foregoing discussion. But how the aforesaid contrary principles
        posited by them can be “brought together under,” i.e., reduced to, the
        types of causes described, is not clearly “expressed,” i.e., distinctly
        stated, by them. Yet it seems that such principles are allotted to the
        class of material cause; for they say that the substance of things is
        composed and moulded out of these principles as something inherent, and
        this is the notion of a material cause. For matter is that from which a
        thing comes to be as something inherent. This is added to distinguish it
        from privation, from which something also comes to be but which is not
        inherent, as the musical is said to come from the non-musical.<br />

      <p>
        63. But there are some [the Eleatics] who spoke of the whole as if it
        were a single nature, although the statements which they made are not
        all alike either with regard to their acceptableness or their conformity
        with nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        64. Therefore a consideration of these men pertains in no way to the
        present investigation of causes. For they do not, like certain of the
        philosophers [the early physicists] who supposed being to be one, still
        generate it from the one as matter; but they speak of this in another
        way. For the others assume motion when they generate this whole, whereas
        these thinkers say it is immobile.
      </p>
      <p>
        65. Yet their opinion is relevant to the present investigation to some
        extent; for Parmenides seems to touch on unity according to intelligible
        structure and Melissus on unity according to matter. This is why the
        former says that it is limited, and the latter that it is unlimited.
        Xenophanes, the first of those to speak of the one (for Parmenides is
        said to have been his disciple), made nothing clear, nor does he seem to
        have touched on either of these. But with regard to the whole heaven he
        says that the one is God.
      </p>
      <p>
        66. As we have stated, then, these men must be dismissed for the
        purposes of the present inquiry. In fact, two of them—Xenophanes and
        Melissus—are to be disregarded altogether as being a little too rustic.
        Parmenides, however, seems to speak with more insight; for he thought
        that besides being there is only non-being, and this is nothing. This is
        why he thinks that being is necessarily one and nothing else. We have
        discussed this point more clearly in the <i>Physics</i>. But being
        compelled to follow the observed facts, and having assumed that what is
        one from the viewpoint of reason is many from the viewpoint of the
        senses, he postulates in turn two principles, i.e., two causes, the hot
        and cold, calling the one fire and the other earth; and of these he
        ranks the hot with being and the cold with non-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        67. From what has been said, then, and from the wise men who have
        already agreed with this reasoning, we have acquired these things. From
        the first philosophers we have learned that the principle of things is
        corporeal, because water and fire and the like are bodies; and from some
        we have learned that there is one corporeal principle, and from others,
        many; although both suppose that these belong to the class of matter.
        And from others we have learned that in addition to this cause there is
        the source from which motion begins, which some claim to be one and
        others two. Down to the Italian philosophers, then, and independent of
        them, others have spoken of these things in a more trivial way, except
        that, as we have said, they have used two kinds of causes, and one of
        these—the source of motion—some thinkers consider as one and others as
        two.
      </p>
      <p>
        68. Now the Pythagoreans have spoken of these two principles in the same
        way, but added this much, which is peculiar to them, that they did not
        think that the limited, unlimited and one are different natures, like
        fire or earth or anything else of this kind, but that the unlimited
        itself and the one itself are the substance of the things of which they
        are predicated. And this is why they considered number as the substance
        of all things. These thinkers, then have expres emselves thus with
        regard to these things, and they began to discuss and define the “what”
        itself of things, although they treated it far too simply. For they
        defined things superficially and thought that the substance of a thing
        is that to which a given definition first applies; just as if one
        supposed that double and two are the same because that to which the
        double first belongs is the number two. But perhaps “to be double” is
        not the same as “to be two”; and if they are not, then the one itself
        will be many. This, indeed, is the conclusion which they reached. From
        the first philosophers and others, then, this much can be learned.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Unitarians</i></p>
      <p>
        134. Here he gives the opinions of those philosophers who spoke of the
        whole universe as one being; and in regard to this he does two things.
        First, he gives the opinion which they held in common; and second (135),
        he shows how a consideration of this opinion is relevant to the present
        treatise, and how it is not (“Therefore a consideration”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, then, that there were certain philosophers, other than those
        just mentioned, who spoke “of the whole,” i.e,, of the universe, as if
        it were of one nature, i.e., as if the whole universe were a single
        being or a single nature. However, not all maintained this position in
        the same way, as he will make clear below (138-49). Yet in the way in
        which they differ their statements are neither acceptable nor in
        conformity with nature. None of their statements are in conformity with
        nature, because they did away with motion in things. And none of them
        are acceptable, because they held an impossible position and used
        sophistical arguments, as is clear in Book I of the <i>Physics</i>.
      </p>
      <p>135. <b>Therefore a consideration</b> (64).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows how a consideration of this position pertains to the
        present investigation and how it does not. He shows, first, that it has
        no bearing on this investigation if we consider their position itself;
        and, second (137), that it does have a bearing on this investigation if
        the reasoning or method behind their position is considered (“Yet their
        opinion”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, then, that since these philosophers held that there is only one
        being, and a single thing cannot be its own cause, it is clear that they
        could not discover the causes. For the position that there is a
        plurality of things demands a diversity of causes in the world. Hence, a
        consideration of their statements is of no value for the purposes of the
        present study, which deals with causes. But the situation is different
        in the case of the ancient philosophers of nature, who held that there
        is only one being, and whose statements must be considered here. For
        they generated many things from that one principle as matter, and thus
        posited both cause and effect. But these men with whom we are now
        dealing speak of this in a different way. For they do not say that all
        things are one materially, so that all things are generated from one
        matter, but
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >that all things are one in an absolute sense</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        136. The reason for this difference is that the ancient philosophers of
        nature added motion to the view of those who posited one being and one
        principle, and said that this one being is mobile; and therefore
        different things could be generated from that one principle by a certain
        kind of motion, i.e., by
        <span style="font-weight: bold">rarefaction</span> and
        <span style="font-weight: bold">condensation</span>. And they said that
        the whole universe with respect to the diversity found in its parts is
        generated in this way. Yet since they held that the only change
        affecting substance is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">accidental</span>, as was stated above
        (75), the conclusion then followed that the whole universe is one thing
        substantially but many things accidentally. But these thinkers [i.e.,
        the Eleatics], said that the one being which they posited is immobile in
        an absolute sense; and therefore a diversity of things could not be
        produced from that one being. For since this being is immobile they
        could not posit any plurality in the world, either substantial or
        accidental.
      </p>
      <p>137. <b>Yet their opinion</b> (65).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows how their opinion is relevant to the present inquiry.
        First, he deals with all of these thinkers in general; and second (142),
        with Parmenides in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first, that although they did away with diversity in the world,
        and consequently with causality, nevertheless their opinion is relevant
        to the present study to this extent, let us say: as regards the method
        by which they establish their position and the reason for their
        position.
      </p>
      <p>
        138. Parmenides, who was a member of this group, seems to touch on unity
        according to intelligible structure) i.e., according to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">form</span>; for he argued as follows:
        besides being there is only non-being, and non-being is nothing.
        Therefore besides being there is nothing. But being is one. Therefore,
        besides the one there is nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this argument he clearly considered the intelligible structure itself
        of being, which seems to be one, because nothing can be understood to be
        added to the concept of being by which it might be diversified. For
        whatever is added to being must be other than being. But anything such
        as this is nothing. Hence it does not seem that this can diversify
        being; just as we also see that differences added to a genus diversify
        it, even though these differences are outside the substance of that
        genus. For differences do not participate in a genus, as is stated in
        the <i>Topics</i>, Book IV, otherwise a genus would have the substance
        of a difference. And definitions would be nonsense if when a genus is
        given the difference were added, granted that the genus were the
        substance of the difference, just as it would be nonsense if the species
        were added. Moreover a difference would not differ in any way from a
        species. But those things which are outside the substance of being must
        be non-being, and thus cannot diversify being.
      </p>
      <p>
        139. But they were mistaken in this matter, because they used being as
        if it were one in intelligible structure and in nature, like the nature
        of any <span style="font-weight: bold">genus</span>. But this is
        impossible. For being is not a genus but is predicated of different
        things in many ways. Therefore in Book I of the <i>Physics</i> it is
        said that the statement “Being is one” is false. For being does not have
        one nature like one genus or one species.
      </p>
      <p>
        140. But Melissus considered being in terms of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">matter</span>. For he argued that being
        is one by reason of the fact that being is not generated from something
        prior, and this characteristic pertains properly to matter, which is
        ungenerated. For he argued in this way: whatever is generated has a
        starting-point. But being is not generated and therefore does not have a
        starting-point. But whatever lacks a starting-point lacks an end and
        therefore is unlimited. And if it is unlimited, it is immobile, because
        what is unlimited has nothing outside itself by which it is moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being is not generated he proves thus. If being were generated, it
        would be generated either from being or from non-being. But it is not
        generated from non-being, because non-being is nothing and from nothing
        nothing comes. Nor is it generated from being, because then a thing
        would be before it came to be. Therefore it is not generated in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this argument he obviously treats being as matter, because it is of
        the very nature of matter not to be generated from something prior. And
        since limitation pertains to form, and unlimitedness to matter,
        <i>Melissus</i>, who considered being under the aspect of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">matter</span>, said that there is one
        unlimited being. But <i>Parmenides</i>, who considered being under the
        aspect of <span style="font-weight: bold">form</span>, said that being
        is limited. Hence, insofar as being is considered under the aspect of
        form and matter, a study of these men is relevant to the present
        investigation; because matter and form are included among the causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        141. But Xenophanes, who was the first of those to say that
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">everything is one</span> (and
        therefore Parmenides was his disciple), did not explain by what
        reasoning he maintained that all things are one, either by arguing from
        the viewpoint of matter, or from that of form. Hence, with respect to
        neither nature, i.e., neither matter nor form, does he seem “to come up
        to these men,” that is, to reach and equal them in their irrational
        manner of arguing.
      </p>
      <p>
        But concerning the whole heaven he says that the one is God. For the
        ancients said that the world itself is God. Hence, seeing that all parts
        of the universe are alike insofar as they are bodies, he came to think
        of them as if they were all one. And just as the foregoing philosophers
        held that beings are one by considering those things which pertain
        either to matter or to form, in a similar way these philosophers
        maintained this position regarding the composite itself.
      </p>
      <p>142. <b>As we have stated</b> (66).</p>
      <p>
        His aim here is to explain in a special way how the opinion of
        Parmenides pertains to the present investigation. He concludes from the
        foregoing that, since these men did away with (~)
        <span style="font-weight: bold">diversity</span> in the world and
        therefore with (~) <span style="font-weight: bold">causality</span>, all
        of them must be disregarded so far as the present study is concerned.
        Two of them—Xenophanes and Melissus—must be disregarded altogether,
        because they are a little too “rustic,” i.e., they proceeded with less
        accuracy. But Parmenides seems to have expressed his views “with more
        insight,” i.e., with greater understanding. For he employs the following
        argument: besides being there is only non-being, and whatever is
        non-being “is thought to be nothing”; i.e., he considers it worthy to be
        nothing. Hence he thought that it necessarily followed that being is
        one, and that whatever is other than being is nothing. This argument has
        been treated more clearly in the <i>Physics</i>, Book I.
      </p>
      <p>
        143. But even though Parmenides was compelled by this argument to hold
        that all things are one, yet, because there appeared to the senses to be
        many things in reality, and because he was compelled to accept what
        appeared to the senses, it was his aim to make his position conform to
        both of these, i.e., to what is apprehended both by the senses and by
        reason. Hence he said that all things are one according to reason but
        many according to the senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        And inasmuch as he held that there is a plurality of things according to
        the senses, he was able to hold that there is in the world both cause
        and effect. Hence he posited two causes, namely, the hot and the cold,
        one of which he ascribed to fire, and the other to earth. And one of
        these—the hot or fire—seemed to pertain to the efficient cause, and the
        other—cold or earth—to the material cause. And lest his position should
        seem to contradict the conclusion of his own argument that whatever is
        besides being is nothing, he said that one of these causes—the hot—is
        being, and that the other cause—the one besides being, or the cold—is
        non-being, according to. both reason and the truth of the thing itself,
        and is a being only according to sensory perception.
      </p>
      <p>
        144. Now in this matter he comes very close to the truth; for the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">material</span> principle, which he held
        to be earth, is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">not an actual being</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in a similar way, too, one of two contraries is a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">privation</span>, as is said in Book I
        of the <i>Physics</i>. But privation does not belong to the intelligible
        constitution of being. Hence in a sense cold is the privation of heat,
        and thus is non-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        145. <b>From what has been said</b> (67). Here he summarizes the remarks
        which have been made about the doctrines of the ancient philosophers;
        and in regard to this he does two things. First, he summarizes the
        remarks made about the doctrines of the ancient philosophers of nature;
        and second (147), those made about the doctrines of the Pythagoreans,
        who introduced mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore from the above remarks he concludes, first, that from the
        foregoing philosophers, who adopted the same opinion, namely, that the
        material cause is the substance of things, and who were already
        beginning by the use of reason to know the causes of things by
        investigating them, we learn the causes which have been mentioned. For
        from the first philosophers it was learned that the principle of all
        things is corporeal. This is evident from the fact that water and the
        like, which are given as the principles of things, are bodies. However,
        they differed in this respect, that some, such as Thales, Diogenes and
        similar thinkers, claimed that there is only one corporeal principle,
        whereas others, such as Anaxagoras, Democritus and Leucippus, held that
        there are several corporeal principles. Yet both groups, i.e., both
        those who posited one principle and those who posited many, placed such
        corporeal principles in the class of material cause. And some of them
        not only posited a material cause but added to this the cause from which
        motion begins: some holding it to be one, as Anaxagoras did in positing
        intellect, and Parmenides, love, and others to be two, as Empedocles did
        in positing love and hate.
      </p>
      <p>
        146. Hence, it is clear that these philosophers who lived down to the
        time of the Italians, or Pythagoreans, “and [were] independent of them,”
        i.e., who had their own opinions about reality and were unaware of those
        of the Pythagoreans, spoke obscurely about the principles of things; for
        they did not designate to what class of cause such principles might be
        reduced. Yet they made use of two causes, i.e., the source from which
        motion begins and matter: some saying that the former—the source from
        which motion begins—is one, and others two; as has been pointed out
        (145).
      </p>
      <p>147. <b>Now the Pythagoreans</b> (68).</p>
      <p>
        Here he summarizes the opinions expressed by the Pythagoreans, both what
        they held in common with the foregoing philosophers, and what was
        peculiar to themselves. Now the opinion common to some of the foregoing
        philosophers and to the Pythagoreans was this that they posited, in a
        sense, two principles in the same way as the foregoing philosophers did.
        For Empedocles held that there are two contrary principles, one being
        the principle of good things, and the other the principle of evil
        things, and the Pythagoreans did the same thing, as is clear from the
        co-ordination of contrary principles which they posited.
      </p>
      <p>
        148. However, they did not do this in the same way; because Empedocles
        placed these contrary principles in the class of material cause, as was
        stated above (111), whereas the Pythagoreans added their own opinion to
        that of the other thinkers. The first thing that they added is this:
        they said that what I call the <i>one</i>, the <i>limited</i> and the
        <i>unlimited</i> are not (~)
        <span style="font-weight: bold">accidents</span> of any other natures,
        such as fire or earth or the like, but claimed that what I call the one,
        the limited and the unlimited constitute the (+)
        <span style="font-weight: bold">substance</span> of the same things of
        which they are predicated. From this they concluded that <i>number</i>,
        which is constituted of units, is the substance of all things. But while
        the other philosophers of nature posited the one, the limited and the
        unlimited, they nevertheless attributed these to another nature, as
        accidents are attributed to a subject, for example, to fire or water or
        something of this kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        149. The second addition which they made to the views of the other
        philosophers is this: they began to discuss and to define “the whatness
        itself,” i.e., the <span style="font-weight: bold">substance</span> and
        quiddity of things, although they treated this far too simply by
        defining things superficially. For in giving definitions they paid
        attention only to one thing; because they said that, if any given
        definition were to apply primarily to some thing, this would be the
        substance of that thing; just as if one were to suppose that the ratio
        “double” is the substance of the number two, because such a ratio is
        found first in the number two. And since being was found first in the
        one rather than in the many (for the many is composed of ones), they
        therefore said that being is the substance itself of the one.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this conclusion of theirs is not acceptable; for although the number
        two is double, the essence of twoness is not the same as that of the
        double in such a way that they are the same conceptually, as the
        definition and the thing defined. But even if their statements were
        true, it would follow that the many would be one. For some plurality can
        belong primarily to something one; for example, evenness and the ratio
        double belong first to the number two. Hence [according to them] it
        would follow that the even and the double are the same. And it would
        likewise follow that that to which the double belongs is the same as the
        number two, so long as the double is the substance of the number two.
        This, indeed, is also the conclusion which the Pythagoreans drew; for
        they attributed plurality and diversity to things as if they were one,
        just as they said that the properties of numbers are the same as the
        properties of natural beings.

        150. Hence, Aristotle concludes that it is possible to learn this much
        from the early philosophers, who posited only one material principle,
        and from the later philosophers, who posited many principles.<br />

      <p>
        69. After the philosophies described came the system of Plato, which
        followed them in many respects, but also had other [theses] of its own
        in addition to the philosophy of the Italians. For Plato agreeing at the
        very beginning with the opinions of Cratylus (362) and Heraclitus that
        all sensible things are always in a state of flux, and that there is no
        scientific knowledge of them, also accepted this doctrine in later
        years. However, when Socrates, concerning himself with moral matters and
        neglecting nature as a whole, sought for the universal in these matters
        and fixed his thought on definition, Plato accepted him because of this
        kind of investigation, and assumed that this consideration refers to
        other entities and not to sensible ones. For [according to him] it is
        impossible that there should be a common definition of any one of these
        sensible things which are always changing. Such entities, then, he
        called Ideas or Forms (<i>species</i>); and he said that all sensible
        things exist because of them and in conformity with them; for there are
        many individuals of the same name because of participation in these
        Forms. With regard to participation, he [merely] changed the name; for
        while the Pythagoreans say that things exist by imitation of numbers,
        Plato says that they exist by participation, changing the name. Yet what
        this participation or imitation of Forms is they commonly neglected to
        investigate.
      </p>
      <p>
        70. Further, he says that besides sensible things and Ideas there are
        the objects of mathematics, which constitute an intermediate class.
        These differ from sensible things in being eternal and immobile; and
        from the Ideas in that there are many alike, whereas each Idea is itself
        only one.
      </p>
      <p>
        71. And since the Forms [or Ideas] are the causes of other things, he
        thought that the elements of these are the elements of all existing
        things. Hence, according to him, the great and small are principles as
        matter, and the one as substance [or form]; for it is from these by
        participation in the one that the Ideas are numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        72. Yet Plato said that the one is substance and that no other being is
        to be called one, just as the Pythagoreans did; and like them too he
        said that numbers are the causes of real substance.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        73. But to posit a dyad in place of the indeterminate one, and to
        produce the unlimited out of the great and small, is peculiar to him.
        Moreover, he says that numbers exist apart from sensible things, whereas
        they say that things themselves are numbers. Further, they do not
        maintain that the objects of mathematics are an intermediate class.
      </p>
      <p>
        74. Therefore, his making the one and numbers to exist apart from things
        and not in things, as Pythagoreans did, and his introducing the separate
        Forms, were due to his investigation into the intelligible structures of
        things; for the earlier philosophers were ignorant of dialectic.
      </p>
      <p>
        75. But his making the dyad [or duality] to be a different nature was
        due to the fact that all numbers, with the exception of prime numbers,
        are naturally generated from the number two as a matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
        76. Yet what happens is the contrary of this. For this view is not a
        reasonable one; because the Platonists produce many things from matter
        but their form generates only once.
      </p>
      <p>
        77. And from one matter one measure seems to be produced, whereas he who
        induces the form, even though he is one, produces many measures. The
        male is also related to the female in a similar way; for the latter is
        impregnated by one act, but the male impregnates many females. And such
        are the changes in these principles. Concerning the causes under
        investigation, then, Plato defines them thus.
      </p>
      <p>
        78. From the foregoing account it is evident that Plato used only two
        causes: one being the the whatness of a thing, and the other, matter;
        for the Forms are the cause of the quiddity in other things, and the one
        is the cause of the quiddity in the Forms. What the underlying matter is
        of which the Forms are predicated in the case of sensible things, and
        the one in the case of the Forms, is also evident, namely, that it is
        this duality, the great and small. Moreover, he assigned the cause of
        good and evil to these two elements, one to each of them; which is
        rather a problem, as we say (48), that some of the first philosophers,
        such as Empedocles and Anaxagoras, [have attempted] to investigate.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Plato and form</i></p>
      <p>
        151. Having given the opinion of the ancient philosophers about the
        material and efficient cause, he gives a third opinion, that of Plato,
        who was the first to clearly introduce the formal cause. This is divided
        into two parts. First, he gives Plato’s opinion. Second (171), from all
        of the foregoing remarks he makes a summary of the opinions which the
        other philosophers expressed about the four classes of causes (“We have
        examined”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he gives Plato’s
        opinion about the substances of things; and second (159), his opinion
        about the principles of things (“And since the Forms”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he gives Plato’s
        opinion insofar as he posited
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Ideas</span>; and second (157), insofar
        as he posited intermediate substances, namely, the separate mathematical
        entities (“Further, he says”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first, that after all the foregoing philosophers came the
        system of Plato, who immediately preceded Aristotle; for Aristotle is
        considered to have been his disciple. And even if Plato followed in many
        respects the natural philosophers who preceded him, such as Empedocles,
        Anaxagoras and the like, he nevertheless had certain other doctrines of
        his own in addition to those of the preceding philosophers, because of
        the philosophy of the Italians, or Pythagoreans. For insofar as he was
        devoted to the study of truth he sought out the philosophers of all
        lands in order to learn their teachings. Hence he came to Tarenturn in
        Italy, and was instructed in the teachings of the Pythagoreans by
        Archytas of Tarenturn, a disciple of Pythagoras.
      </p>
      <p>
        152. Now Plato would seem to follow the natural philosophers who lived
        in Greece; and of this group some of the later members held that all
        sensible things are always in a state of flux, and that there can be no
        scientific knowledge of them (which was the position of Heraclitus and
        Cratylus). And since Plato became accustomed to positions of this kind
        from the very beginning, and agreed with these men in this position,
        which he acknowledged to be true in later years, he therefore said that
        scientific knowledge of particular sensible things must be abandoned.
        And Socrates (who was Plato’s master and the disciple of Archelaus, a
        pupil of Anaxagoras), because of this position, which arose in his time,
        that there can be no science of sensible things, was unwilling to make
        any investigation into the nature of physical things, but only busied
        himself with moral matters. And in this field he first began to
        investigate what the universal is, and to insist upon the need for
        definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        153. Hence, Plato, being Socrates’ pupil, “accepted Socrates,” i.e.,
        followed him, and adopted this method for the purpose of investigating
        natural beings. He did so believing that in their case the universal in
        them could successfully be grasped and a definition be assigned to it,
        with no definition being given for any sensible thing; because, since
        sensible things are always “changing,” i.e., being changed, no common
        intelligible structure can be assigned to any of them. For every
        definition must conform to each thing defined and must always do so, and
        thus requires some kind of immutability. Hence universal entities of
        this kind, which are separate from sensible things and that to which
        definitions are assigned, he called the Ideas or Forms of sensible
        things. He called them Ideas, or exemplars, inasmuch as sensible things
        are made in likeness to them; and he called them Forms inasmuch as
        [sensible things] have substantial being by participating in them. Or he
        called them Ideas inasmuch as they are principles of being, and Forms
        inasmuch as they are principles of knowledge. Hence all sensible things
        have being because of them and in conformity with them. They have being
        because of the Ideas insofar as the Ideas are the causes of the being of
        sensible things, and “in conformity with them” insofar as they are the
        exemplars of sensible things.
      </p>
      <p>
        154. The truth of this is clear from the fact that “many individuals of
        the same name” are attributed to one Form alone, i.e., there are many
        individuals which have the same Form predicated of them, and predicated
        by participation. For the Form or Idea [of man] is the specific nature
        itself by which there exists man essentially. But an individual is man
        by participation inasmuch as the specific nature [man] is participated
        in by this designated matter. For that which is something in its
        entirety does not participate in it but is essentially identical with
        it, whereas that which is not something in its entirety but has this
        other thing joined to it, is said properly to participate in that thing.
        Thus, if heat were a self-subsistent heat, it would not be said to
        participate in heat, because it would contain nothing but heat. But
        since fire is something other than heat, it is said to participate in
        heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        155. In a similar way, since the separate Idea of man contains nothing
        but the specific nature itself, it is man essentially; and for this
        reason it was called by him man-in-itself. But since Socrates and Plato
        have in addition to their specific nature an individuating principle,
        which is designated matter, they are therefore said to participate in a
        Form, according to Plato.
      </p>
      <p>
        156. Now Plato took this term participation from Pythagoras, although
        [in doing so] he made a change in the term. For the Pythagoreans said
        that numbers are the causes of things, just as the Platonists said that
        the Ideas are, and claimed that sensible things of this kind exist as
        certain imitations of numbers. For inasmuch as numbers, which have no
        position of themselves, received positions, they caused bodies. But
        because Plato held that the Ideas are unchangeable in order that there
        might be scientific knowledge of them, he did not agree that the term
        <i>imitation</i> could be used of the Ideas, but in place of it he used
        the term <i>participation</i>. However, it must be noted that, even
        though the Pythagoreans posited participation or imitation, they still
        did not investigate the way in which a common Form is participated in by
        individual sensible things or imitated by them. But the Platonists have
        treated this.
      </p>
      <p>157. <b>Further, he says</b> (70).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives Plato’s opinion about the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">mathematical substances</span>. He says
        that Plato posited other substances—the objects of mathematics—in
        addition to the Forms and sensible things. Moreover, he said that beings
        of this kind were an intermediate class among the three kinds of
        substances; or that they were above sensible substances and below the
        Forms, and differed from both. The mathematical substances differed from
        sensible substances, because sensible substances are corruptible and
        changeable, whereas the mathematical substances are eternal and
        immobile. The PIatonists got this idea from the way in which
        mathematical science conceives its objects; for mathematical science
        abstracts from motion. The mathematical substances also differed from
        the Forms, because the objects of mathematics are found to be
        numerically different and specifically the same, otherwise the
        demonstrations of mathematics would prove nothing. For unless two
        triangles belonged to the same class, geometry would attempt in vain to
        demonstrate that some triangles are alike; and the same thing is true of
        other figures. But this does not happen in the case of the Forms. For,
        since a Form is just the specific nature itself of a thing, each Form
        can only be unique. For even though the Form of man is one thing, and
        the Form of ass another thing, nevertheless the Form of man is unique,
        and so is the Form of ass; and the same thing is true of other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        158. Now to one who carefully examines Plato’s arguments it is evident
        that Plato’s opinion was false, because
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >he believed that the mode of being which the thing known has in
          reality is the same as the one which it has in the act of being
          known</span
        >. Therefore, since he found that our intellect understands abstractions
        in two ways: in one way as we understand universals abstracted from
        singulars, and in another way as we understand the objects of
        mathematics abstracted from sensible things, he claimed that for each
        abstraction of the intellect there is a corresponding abstraction in the
        essences of things. Hence he held that both the objects of mathematics
        and the Forms are separate.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this is not necessary. For even though the intellect understands
        things insofar as it becomes assimilated to them through the
        intelligible form by which it is put into act, it still is not necessary
        that a form should have the same mode of being in the intellect that it
        has in the thing known; for everything that exists in something else
        exists there according to the mode of the recipient. Therefore,
        considering the nature of the intellect, which is other than the nature
        of the thing known, the mode of understanding, by which the intellect
        understands, must be one kind of mode, and the mode of being, by which
        things exist, must be another. For although the object which the
        intellect understands must exist in reality, it does not exist there
        according to the same mode [which it has in the intellect]. Hence, even
        though the intellect understands mathematical entities without
        simultaneously understanding sensible substances, and understands
        universals without understanding particulars, it is not therefore
        necessary that the objects of mathematics should exist apart from
        sensible things, or that universals should exist apart from particulars.
        For we also see that sight perceives color apart from flavor, even
        though flavor and color are found together in sensible substances.
      </p>
      <p>159. <b>And since the Forms</b> (159).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives Plato’s opinion concerning the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">principles of things</span>; and in
        regard to this he does two things. First, he states the principles which
        Plato assigned to things; and second (169), the class of cause to which
        they are reduced (“From the foregoing”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he tells us what kind
        of principles Plato had assigned to things. Second (160), he shows in
        what respect Plato agreed with the Pythagoreans, and in what respect he
        differed from them (“Yet Plato”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first, that, since the Forms are the causes of all other beings
        according to Plato, the Platonists therefore thought that the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">elements of the Forms</span> are the
        elements of all beings. Hence, they assigned as the material principle
        of things <span style="font-weight: bold">the great and small</span>,
        and said that “the substance of things,” i.e., their form, is the one.
        They did this because they held these to be the principles of the Forms.
        For they said that just as the Forms are the formal principles of
        sensible things, in a similar way the <i>one</i> is the formal principle
        of the Forms. Therefore, just as sensible things are constituted of
        universal principles by participation in the Forms, in a similar way the
        Forms, which he said are numbers, are constituted “of these,” i.e., of
        the <i>great and small</i>. For the unit constitutes different species
        of numbers by addition and subtraction, in which the notion of the great
        and small consists. Hence, since the one was thought to be the substance
        of being (because he did not distinguish between the one which is the
        principle of number, and the one which is convertible with being), it
        seemed to him that a plurality of different Forms might be produced from
        the one, which is their common substance, in the same way that a
        plurality of different species of numbers is produced from the unit.
      </p>
      <p>160. <b>Yet Plato</b> (72).</p>
      <p>
        Here he compares the position of Plato with that of Pythagoras. First,
        he shows in what respect they agreed; and second (160), in what respect
        they differed (“But to posit”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now they <span style="font-weight: bold">agreed</span> in two positions;
        (1) and the first is that the one is the substance of things. For the
        Platonists, like the Pythagoreans, said that what I call the one is not
        predicated’ of some other being as an accident is of a subject, but
        signifies a thing’s substance. They said this, as we have pointed out
        (159), because they did not distinguish between the one which is
        convertible with being and the one which is the principle of number.
      </p>
      <p>
        161. (2) The second position follows from the first; for the Platonists,
        like the Pythagoreans, said that numbers are the causes of the substance
        of all beings; and they held this because [in their opinion] number is
        just a collection of units. Hence if the one is substance, number must
        also be such.
      </p>
      <p>162. <b>But to posit</b> (73).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows in what respect they
        <span style="font-weight: bold">differed</span>; and in regard to this
        he does two things. First, he states how they differed. Second (164), he
        gives the reason for this difference (“Therefore, his making”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now this difference involves two things. First, the Pythagoreans, as has
        already been stated, posited two principles of which things are
        constituted, namely, the limited and the unlimited, of which one, i.e.,
        the unlimited, has the character of matter. But in place of this one
        principle—the unlimited— which the Pythagoreans posited, Plato created a
        dyad, holding that the great and small have the character of matter.
        Hence the unlimited, which Pythagoras claimed to be one principle, Plato
        claimed to consist of the great and small. This is his own opinion in
        contrast with that of Pythagoras.
      </p>
      <p>
        163. The second difference is that Plato held that numbers are separate
        from sensible things, and this in two ways. For he said that the Forms
        themselves are numbers, as was pointed out above (159); and he also
        held, as was stated above (157), that the objects of mathematics are an
        intermediate class between the Forms and sensible things, and that they
        are numbers by their very essence. But the Pythagoreans said that
        sensible things themselves are numbers, and did not make the objects of
        mathematics an intermediate class between the Forms and sensible things;
        nor again did they hold that the Forms are separate from things.
      </p>
      <p>164. <b>Therefore, his making</b> (74).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the reason for the difference. First, he gives the reason
        for the second difference; and then (165), the reason for the first
        difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, then, that the Platonists adopted the position that both the
        one and numbers exist apart from sensible things and not in sensible
        things, as the Pythagoreans claimed; and they also introduced separate
        Forms because of the investigation “which was made into the intelligible
        structures of things,” i.e., because of their investigation of the
        definitions of things, which they thought could not be attributed to
        sensible substances, as has been stated (150). This is the reason they
        were compelled to hold that there are certain things to which
        definitions are assigned. But the Pythagoreans, who came before Plato,
        were ignorant of dialectic, whose office it is to investigate
        definitions and universals of this kind, the study of which led to the
        introduction of the Ideas.
      </p>
      <p>165. <b>But his making</b> (75).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the reason for the other difference, that is, the one
        concerning matter. First, he gives the reason for such a difference.
        Second (166), he shows that Plato was not reasonably motivated.
      </p>
      <p>
        He accordingly says that the Platonists made the dyad [or duality] to be
        a number of a different nature than the Forms, because all numbers with
        the exception of prime numbers are produced from it. They called prime
        numbers those which are not measured by any other number, such as three,
        five, seven, eleven, and so on; for these are produced immediately from
        unity alone. But numbers which are measured by some other number are not
        called prime numbers but composite ones, for example, the number four,
        which is measured by the number two; and in general every even number is
        measured by the number two. Hence even numbers are attributed to matter,
        since unlimitedness, which belongs to matter, is attributed to them, as
        has been stated above (125). This is why he posited the dyad, from which
        as “a matrix,” or exemplar, all other even numbers are produced.
      </p>
      <p>166. <b>Yet what happens</b> (76).</p>
      <p>
        Here he proves that Plato made unreasonable assumptions; and in regard
        to this he does two things. For, first, he proves this by an argument
        from nature. Second (167), he gives the argument based on the nature of
        things, which led Plato to adopt this position (“And from one matter”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says that, although Plato posited a dyad on the part of matter, still
        what happens is the contrary of this, as the opinions of all the other
        natural philosophers testify; for they claimed that contrariety pertains
        to form and unity to matter, as is clear in Book I of the
        <i>Physics</i>. For they held that the material principle of things is
        air or water or something of this kind, from which the diversity of
        things is produced by rarefaction and condensation, which they regarded
        as formal principles; for Plato’s position is not a reasonable one. Now
        the natural philosophers adopted this position because they saw that
        many things are generated from matter as a result of a succession of
        forms in matter. For that matter which now supports one form may
        afterwards support rnany forms as a result of one form being corrupted
        and another being generated. But one specifying principle or form
        “generates only once,” i.e., constitutes the thing which is generated.
        For when something is generated it receives a form, and the same form
        numerically cannot become the form of another thing that is generated,
        but ceases to be when that which was generated undergoes corruption. In
        this argument it is clearly apparent that one matter is related to many
        forms, and not the reverse, i.e., one form to many matters. Thus it
        seems more reasonable to hold that unity pertains to matter but duality
        or contrariety to form, as the philosophers of nature claimed. This is
        the opposite of what Plato held.
      </p>
      <p>167. <b>And from one matter</b> (77).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives an opposite argument taken from sensible things according
        to the opinion of Plato. For Plato saw that each thing is received in
        something else according to the measure of the recipient. Hence
        receptions seem to differ according as the capacities of recipients
        differ. But one matter is one capacity for reception. And Plato also saw
        that the agent who induces the form, although he is one, causes many
        things to have this form; and this comes about because of diversity on
        the part of matter. An example of this is evident in the case of male
        and female; for a male is related to a female as an agent and one who
        impresses a form on matter. But a female is impregnated by one act of a
        male, whereas one male can impregnate many females. This is why he held
        that unity pertains to form and duality to matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        168. Now we must note that this difference between Plato and the
        philosophers of nature is a result of the fact that they considered
        things from different points of view. For the philosophers of nature
        considered sensible things only insofar as they are subject to change,
        in which one subject successively acquires contrary qualities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence they attributed unity to matter and contrariety to form. But
        Plato, because of his investigation of universals, went on to give the
        principles of sensible things. Therefore, since the cause of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">diversity</span> of the many singular
        things which come under one universal is the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">division of matter</span>, he held that
        diversity pertains to matter and unity to form. “And such are the
        changes of those principles” which Plato posited, i.e., participations,
        or, as I may say, influences in the things generated. For Pythagoras
        understands the word <i>change</i> in this way. Or Aristotle says
        “changes” inasmuch as Plato changed the opinion which the first
        philosophers of nature had about principles, as is evident from the
        foregoing. Hence it is evident from the foregoing that Plato dealt thus
        with the causes which we are investigating.
      </p>
      <p>169. <b>From the foregoing</b> (78).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows to what class of cause the principles given by Plato are
        referred. He says that it is evident from the foregoing that Plato used
        only two kinds of causes. For he used as “one” cause of a thing the
        cause of its “whatness,” i.e., its quiddity, or its formal cause, which
        determines its quiddity; and he also used matter itself. This is also
        evident from the fact that the Forms which he posited “are the causes of
        other things,” i.e., the causes of the whatness of sensible things,
        namely, their formal causes, whereas the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">formal</span> cause of the Forms
        themselves is what I call the <i>one</i>, which seems to be the
        substance of which the Forms are composed. And just as he holds that the
        one is the formal cause of the Forms, in a similar fashion he holds that
        <i>the great and small</i> are their
        <span style="font-weight: bold">material</span> cause, as was stated
        above (159). And these causes—the formal and the material cause—are
        referred not only to the Forms but also to sensible substances, because
        [there is some subject of which] the one is predicated in the case of
        the Forms. That is to say, that which is related to sensible substances
        in the same way as the one is to the Forms is itself a Form, because
        that duality which relates to sensible things as their matter is the
        great and small.
      </p>
      <p>
        170. Furthermore, Plato indicated the cause of good and evil in the
        world, and he did this with reference to each of the elements which he
        posited. For
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >he made Form the cause of good and matter the cause of evil</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, some of the first philosophers attempted to investigate the
        cause of good and evil, namely, Anaxagoras and Empedocles, who
        established certain causes in the world with this special end in view
        that by means of these causes they might be able to give the principles
        of good and evil. And in touching upon these causes of good and evil
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >they came very close to positing the final cause, although they did
          not posit this cause directly but only indirectly</span
        >, as is stated below (177).<br />

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 7: 988a 18-988b 21
      </p>
      <p>
        79. We have examined, then, in a brief and summary way those
        philosophers who’ have spoken about the principles of things and about
        the truth, and the way in which they did this. Yet we have learned from
        them this much: that none of those who have discussed principle and
        cause have said anything beyond the points established by us in the
        <i>Physics</i>.
      </p>
      <p>80. Yet all have approached these causes obscurely.</p>
      <p>
        81. For some speak of the [first] principle as matter, whether they
        suppose it to be one or many, and whether they assume it to be a body or
        something incorporeal, as Plato speaks of the great and small; the
        Italians of the unlimited; Empedocles of fire, earth, water and air; and
        Anaxagoras of an infinite number of like parts. All these have touched
        on this kind of cause, and so also have those who make the first
        principle air or fire or water or something denser than fire or rarer
        than air. For they have said that some such body is the primary element.
        These thinkers, then, have touched only on this cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        82. But others [have introduced] the source of motion, for example,
        those who make friendship and strife, or intellect, or love, or
        something besides these, a principle of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        83. But the quiddity or substance no one has presented clearly. Those
        who express it best are those wbo posit the Ideas and the intelligible
        natures inherent in the Ideas. For they do not think of the Ideas and
        the things inherent in them as the matter of sensible things; nor do
        they think of them as the source from which motion originates, for they
        say that these things are the causes rather of immobility and of that
        which is at rest. But [according to them] the Forms are responsible for
        the quiddity of all other things, and the one for the quiddity of the
        Forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        84. That for the sake of which there are actions and changes and motions
        they affirm in some way to be a cause, but not in the way we are
        determining causes, or in the way in which it is truly a cause. For
        while those who speak of intellect or love posit these causes as good,
        they do not say that anything exists or comes to be because of them, but
        claim that the motion of things stems from them. In like manner those
        who say that the one or being is such a reality, say that it is the
        cause of substance, but not that things either are or come to be for the
        sake of this. Hence, it happens to them that in a way they both say and
        do not say that the good is a cause; for they do not speak of it in its
        principal aspect but in a secondary one.
      </p>
      <p>
        85. Therefore all these philosophers, being unable to touch on any other
        cause, seem to bear witness to the fact that we have dealt correctly
        with the causes, both as to their number and their kinds. Moreover, it
        is evident that all principles must be sought in this way or in some
        similar one. As to the way in which each of these philosophers has
        spoken, and how they have raised possible problems about the principles
        of things, let us discuss these points next.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        171. Here he makes a summary of everything that the early philosophers
        have said about causes* and in regard to this he does three' things.
        First (79:C 171), he shows that the early philosophers were unable to
        add artother kind of cause to the four classes of causes given above
        (34:C 70). Second (80:C 172), he indicates the way in which they touched
        upon these causes ("Yet all"). Third (85:C 180) he draws the conclusion
        at which he chiefly aims ("Therefore all these").
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first (79), that in giving this brief and summary account he
        has stated who the philosophers are, and how they have spoken of the
        principles of things and of what is true of the substance itself of
        things. And from their statements this much can be learned: that none of
        those who have spoken about causes and principles were able to mention
        any causes other than those distinguished in Book II of the
        <i>Physics</i>.
      </p>
      <p>172. <b>Yet all</b> (80).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the way in which they dealt with each of the causes. He
        does this, first (80), in a general way: and, second (81:C 172), in a
        special Way ("For some speak").
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly be says, first, that they not only have not added anything,
        but in the way in which they approached these causes they proceeded
        obscurely and not clearly. For they have not stated to what class of
        cause the principles posited by them would belong; but they gave as
        principles things that can be adapted to some class of cause.
      </p>
      <p>173. <b>For some speak</b> (81).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows in a special way how they touched on each of these causes.
        He shows, first (81), how they touched on the material cause; second
        (82:C 174), On the efficient cause ("But others"); third (83:C 175), on
        the formal cause ("But the quiddity"); and fourth (84:C 177), on the
        final cause ("That for the sake of which").
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first (81), then, that those philosophers, i.e., the early
        ones, all agree insofar as they assign some material cause to things.
        Yet they differ in two respects. First, they differ in that some, such
        as Thales, Diogenes and the like, held that the material principle is
        one, whereas others, such as Empedocles, claimed that it is many; and
        second, they differ in that some, such as the first group above, held
        that the material principle of things is a body, whereas others, such as
        Plato, who posited a dyad, claimed that it is something incorporeal. For
        Plato posited the great and small, which the Platonists do not speak of
        as a body. The Italians, or Pythagoreans, posited the unlimited; but
        neither is this a body. Empedocles, on the other hand, posited the four
        elements, which are bodies; and Anaxagoras also posited "an infinite
        number of like parts," i.e.) [he claimed] that the principles of things
        are an infinite number of like parts. All of these thinkers have touched
        on "this kind of cause," i.e., the material cause, and so also have
        those who said that the principle of things is air or water or fire or
        something midway between these elements, i.e., what is denser than fire
        and rarer than air. For all philosophers such as those just mentioned
        have claimed that some kind of body is the first element of things. Thus
        Aristotle's statement is evident, namely, that in the light of the
        foregoing remarks these philosophers have posited only the material
        cause.
      </p>
      <p>174. <b>But others</b> (82).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives their opinions about the efficient cause. He says that
        some of the foregoing philosophers have posited, in addition to the
        material cause, a cause from which motion begins, for example, those who
        made love or hate or intellect a cause of things, or those who
        introduced some other active principle distinct from these, as
        Parmenides, who made fire an efficient cause.
      </p>
      <p>175. <b>But the quiddity</b> (83)</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives their opinions about the formal cause. He says that the
        cause through which a thing's substance is known, i.e., the formal
        cause, no one attributed to things with any clarity. And if the ancient
        philosophers touched on something that might pertain to the formal
        cause, as Empedocles did when he claimed that bone and flesh contain
        some proportion [of the elements], by which they are things of this
        kind, nevertheless they did not treat what belongs to the formal cause
        after the manner of a cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        176. But among the other philosophers, those who posited the Forms and
        those intelligible aspects which belong to the Forms, such as unity,
        number and the like, came closest to positing the formal cause. For the
        Forms and everything that belongs to the Forms in the aforesaid way,
        such as unity and number, are not acknowledged or assumed by them to be
        the matter of sensible things, since they place matter rather on the
        side of sensible things; nor do they claim that the Forms are the causes
        from which motion originates in the world, but rather that they are the
        cause of immobility in things. For they said that whatever is found to
        be necessary in sensible things is caused by the Forms, and that these,
        i.e., the Forms, are immobile. For they claimed that the Forms, because
        immobile, are uniform in being, as has been said (69:C 156), so that
        definitions can be given of them and demonstrations made about them. But
        according to the opinion of these men the Forms are responsible for the
        quiddity of pparticular things after the manner of a formal cause, and
        the one is responsible for the quiddity of the Forms.
      </p>
      <p><i>All the foregoing weak on FINAL cause</i></p>
      <p>
        177. <b>That for the sake of which</b> (84). Here he gives the opinions
        of certain thinkers about the final cause. He says that in one sense the
        philosophers say that the goal for the sake of which motions, changes
        and activities occur is a cause, and in another sense they do not. And
        they neither speak of it in the same way, nor in the way in which it is
        a true cause. For those who affirm that intellect or love is a cause,
        posit these causes as good. For they said that things of this kind are
        the causes of things being well disposed, since the cause of good can
        only be good. Hence it follows that they could make intellect and love
        to be causes, just as the good is a cause. But
        <span style="font-weight: bold">good</span> can be understood in two
        ways: (1) in one way as a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">final cause</span>, in the sense that
        something comes to be for the sake of some good; and (2) in another way
        as an <span style="font-weight: bold">efficient cause</span>, as we say
        that the good man does good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now these philosophers did not say that the foregoing causes are good in
        the sense that they are the reason for the existence or coming to be of
        some beings, which pertains to the intelligibility of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">final</span> cause, but in the sense
        that there proceeds from these causes—intellect and will—a kind of
        motion toward the being and coming-to-be of things; and this pertains to
        the intelligibility of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">efficient</span> cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        178. In a similar way the Pythagoreans and Platonists, who said that the
        substance of things is the one itself or being, also attributed
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >goodness to the one or being</span
        >. Thus they said that such a reality, i.e., the good, is the cause of
        the substance of sensible things, either in the manner of a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">formal</span> cause, as the Platonists
        maintained, or in the manner of a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">material</span> cause, as the
        Pythagoreans claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, they did not say that the being and coming-to-be of things
        exists for the sake of this, i.e., the one or being; and this is
        something that pertains to the intelligibility of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">final</span> cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, just as the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">philosophers of nature</span> claimed
        that the good is a cause in the manner of an (+) efficient cause and not
        in that of a (~) formal cause, in a similar way the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Platonists</span> claimed that the good
        is a cause in the manner of a (+) formal cause, and not in that of a (~)
        final cause. The <span style="font-weight: bold">Pythagoreans</span>, on
        the other hand, considered it to be a cause in the manner of a (+)
        material cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        179. It is evident, then, that in one sense they happened to speak of
        the good as a cause and in another not. For they did not speak of it as
        a cause in its principal aspect but in a secondary one; because
        according to its proper intelligible structure the good is a cause in
        the manner of a final cause. This is clear from the fact that the good
        is what all desire. Now that to which an appetite tends is a goal.
        Therefore according to its proper intelligible structure the good is a
        cause in the manner of a goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence those who make the good a cause in its principal aspect claim that
        it is a final cause. But those who attribute a different mode of
        causality to the good claim that the good is a cause but only in a
        secondary way; because they do not hold that it is such by reason of
        being good, but by reason of that to which good happens to belong by
        reason of its being active or perfective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence it is clear that those philosophers posited a final cause only
        incidentally, because they posited as a cause something that is fitting
        to be an end, namely, the good. However, they did not claim that it is a
        cause in the manner of a final cause, as has been stated.
      </p>
      <p><i>Conclusion</i></p>
      <p>180. <b>Therefore all these</b> (85).</p>
      <p>
        Here he draws the conclusion at which he chiefly aims: that the things
        established about the causes, both as to their number and their kinds,
        are correct. For the foregoing philosophers seem to bear witness to this
        in being unable to add another class of cause to those discussed above.
        This is one of the useful pieces of information resulting from the
        account of the foregoing views.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another is that evidently the principles of things must be investigated
        in this science, either all those which the ancient philosophers
        posited, and which have been established above, or some of them. For
        this science considers chiefly the formal and final cause, and also in a
        sense the efficient cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now it is not only necessary that the above views be discussed, but
        after this examination it is also necessary to describe the way in which
        each of these men has spoken (both in what sense their statements are
        acceptable and in what sense not), and how the statements which have
        been made about the principles of things contain a problem.<br />

        86. Therefore all those who hold that the whole is one and say that
        there is a certain single nature as matter, and that this is corporeal
        and has measure, are clearly at fault in many ways. For they give only
        the elements of bodies and not those of incorporeal things, as if
        incorporeal things did not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        87. And in attempting to state the cause of generation and corruption,
        and in treating all things according to the method of natural
        philosophy, they do away with the cause of motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        88. Furthermore, they did not claim that the substance or whatness of a
        thing is a cause of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        89. And they were wrong in holding that any of the simple bodies except
        earth is a principle, without considering how they are generated from
        each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        90. I mean fire, earth, water and air; for some of these are generated
        from each other by combination and others by separation. Now it makes
        the greatest difference as to which of these is prior and which
        subsequent.
      </p>
      <p>
        91. For in one way it would seem that the most basic element of all is
        that from which a thing first comes to be by combination. But such an
        element will be one which has the smallest parts and is the subtlest of
        bodies. Hence all those who posit fire as the first principle make
        statements that conform most closely to this theory. But each of the
        other thinkers admits that the primary element of bodies is something of
        this kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        92. For none of the later thinkers, and none of those who spoke about
        the one, wanted earth to be an element, evidently because of the size of
        its particles. But each of the other three elements finds some
        supporter, for some say that this primary element is fire, others water,
        and others air. But why do they not say that it is earth, as in a sense
        most men do? For they say that everything is earth. And Hesiod says that
        earth is the first of bodies to be generated; for this happens to be the
        ancient and common view. Therefore, according to this theory, if anyone
        says that any of these bodies with the exception of fire is the primary
        element of things, or if anyone holds that it is something denser than
        air but rarer than water, he will not speak the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        93. However, if that which is later in generation is prior in nature,
        and if that which is condensed and compounded is later in generation,
        then the reverse will be true—water will be prior to air, and earth to
        water. Let these points suffice, then, regarding those who posit one
        cause such as we have described.
      </p>
      <p>
        94. The same consequence will also be true if anyone posits many
        elements, as Empedocles says that the four [elemental] bodies are the
        matter of things. For these same consequences must befall this man, as
        well as some which are peculiar to himself. For we see things being
        generated from each other in such a way that the same body does not
        always remain fire or earth. But we have spoken of these matters in our
        physical treatises.
      </p>
      <p>
        95. And concerning the cause of things in motion, whether one or more
        than one must be posited, it must not be thought that what has been said
        is either entirely correct or reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
        96. And in general those who speak thus must do away with alteration,
        because the cold will not come from the hot, nor the hot from the cold.
        For what is it that undergoes these contraries and what is the one
        nature which becomes fire and water? Such a thing Empedocles does not
        admit.
      </p>
      <p>
        97. But if anyone were to maintain that Anaxagoras speaks of two
        elements, they would acknowledge something fully in accord with a theory
        which he himself has not stated articulately, although he would have
        been forced to follow those who express this view. For to say, as he
        did, that in the beginning all things are mixed together is absurd, both
        because it would be necessary to understand that things previously
        existed in an unmixed state, and because it is not fitting that anything
        should be mixed with just anything; and also because properties and
        accidents could be separated from substances (for there is both mixture
        and separation of the same things). Yet, if anyone were to follow him up
        and articulate what he means, his statement would perhaps appear more
        astonishing. For when nothing was distinct from anything else, evidently
        nothing would be truly predicated of that substance. I mean that it
        would neither be white nor black nor tawny, nor have any color, but
        would necessarily be colorless; for otherwise it would have one of these
        colors. And, similarly, it would be without humors. And for the same
        reason it would have no other similar attribute. For it could not have
        any quality or quantity or whatness, because, if it had, some of the
        attributes described as formal principles would inhere in it. But this
        is obviously impossible, since all things are mixed together; for they
        would already be distinct from each other. But he said that all things
        are mixed together except intellect, and that this alone is unmixed and
        pure.’ Now from these statements it follows for him that there are two
        principles, one being the intellect itself (for this is unmixed in an
        absolute sense), and the other being the kind of thing we suppose the
        indeterminate to be before it is limited and participates in a form.
        Hence, what he says is neither correct nor clear, although he intends
        something similar to what later thinkers said and what is now more
        apparent. But these thinkers are concerned only with theories proper to
        generation, corruption and motion; for usually it is only of this kind
        of substance that these men seek the principles and causes.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        181. Having stated the opinions which the philosophers held about the
        principles of things, Aristotle begins here to criticize them; and this
        is divided into two parts. First, he criticizes each opinion. Second
        (272), he summarizes his discussion and links it up with what follows
        (“From the foregoing”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is divided into two parts. First, he criticizes the opinions
        of those who have treated things according to the method of natural
        philosophy. Second (201), he criticizes the opinions of those who have
        not treated things according to the method of natural philosophy, i.e.,
        Pythagoras and Plato, because they posited higher principles than the
        natural philosophers did (“But all those”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first part he does two things. First, he criticizes the
        opinions of those who posited one material cause; and second (190), the
        opinions of those who posited many (“The same consequence”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he criticizes the
        foregoing opinions in a general way; and second (183), in a special way
        (“And they were wrong”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He criticizes these opinions in a general way by means of three
        arguments. The first (86) is this: in the world there are not only
        bodies but also certain incorporeal things, as is clear from
        <i>The Soul</i>. But these men posited only corporeal principles, which
        is clear from the fact that they maintained that “the whole is one,”
        i.e., that the universe is one thing substantially, and that there is a
        single nature as matter, and that this is corporeal and has “measure,”
        i.e., dimension. But a body cannot be the cause of an incorporeal thing.
        Therefore it is evident that they were at fault in this respect that
        they treated the principles of things inadequately. And they were at
        fault not only in this respect but in many others, as is clear from the
        following arguments.
      </p>
      <p>182. <span style="font-weight: bold">And in attempting</span> (87).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument, which runs thus: whoever feels
        obliged to establish the truth about motion must posit a cause of
        motion. But these philosophers felt obliged to treat motion, which is
        clear for two reasons: first, because they tried to state the causes of
        generation and corruption in the world, which do not occur without
        motion; and second, because they wanted to treat things according to the
        method of natural philosophy. But since a treatment of things according
        to this method involves motion (because nature is a principle of motion
        and rest, as is clear in Book II of the <i>Physics</i>), they should
        therefore have dealt with that cause which is the source of motion. And
        since they did away with the cause of motion by saying nothing about it,
        obviously they were also at fault in this respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        183.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Furthermore, they did not</span> (88).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument: every natural being has “a substance,”
        i.e., a <i>form of the part</i>, “and whatness,” i.e., quiddity, which
        is the <i>form of the whole</i>.3 He says form inasmuch as it is a
        principle of subsistence, and whatness inasmuch as it is a principle of
        knowing, because <i>what a thing is</i> is known by means of this. But
        the foregoing philosophers did not claim that form is a cause of
        anything. They treated things inadequately, then, and were also at fault
        in neglecting the formal cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        184. <span style="font-weight: bold">For none of the later</span> (92).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he criticizes their opinions in a special way; and he does this
        with respect to two things. First, he criticizes them for maintaining
        that all the elements with the exception of fire are the principles of
        things. Second (187), he criticizes them for omitting earth (“However,
        if”).
      </p>
      <p>
        First (92), he takes up once more the position of those who claimed that
        each of the simple bodies except earth is the [primary] element of
        things. The reason which he gives for this position is that these men
        saw that the simple bodies are generated from each other in such a way
        that some come from others by combination or compacting, as grosser
        things come from more refined ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        185. He also explains how to proceed against their opinions from their
        own arguments. For they claimed that one of these elements is the
        principle of things by arguing that other things are generated from it
        either by combination or by separation. Now it makes the greatest
        difference as to which of these two ways is prior and which subsequent,
        for on this depends the priority or posteriority of that from which
        something is generated. For, on the one hand, that seems to be prior
        from which something is produced by combination; and he gives this
        argument first. Yet, on the other hand, that seems to be prior from
        which something is produced by rarefaction; and he bases his second
        argument on this.
      </p>
      <p>
        186. For the fact that the primary element is that from which something
        is produced by combination supports the opinion which is now held that
        the most basic element is that from which other things are produced by
        combination. This in fact is evident both from reason and from the
        things that they held. It is evident from reason, because that from
        which other things are produced by combination is the most refined type
        of body, and the one having the smallest parts; and this seems to be the
        simpler body. Hence, if the simple is prior to the composite, this body
        seems to be first. It is also evident from the things that they held,
        because all those who posited fire as the principle of things asserted
        that it is the first principle. Similarly, others have been seen to
        follow this argument, for they thought that the primary element of
        bodies is the one having the finest parts. This is evident from the fact
        that none of the later philosophers followed the theological poets, who
        said that earth is the primary element of things. Evidently they refused
        to do this “because of the size of its parts,” i.e., because of the
        coarseness of its parts. However, it is a fact that each of the other
        three elements finds some philosopher who judges it to be the principle
        of things. But their refusal to make earth a principle is not to be
        explained by a refusal to reject a common opinion; for many men thought
        that earth is the substance of things. Hesiod, who was one of the
        theological poets, also said that earth is the first of all bodies to
        come into
      </p>
      <p>
        being. Thus the opinion that earth is the principle of things is
        evidently an ancient one, because it was maintained by the theological
        poets, who preceded the philosophers of nature. It was also the common
        opinion, because many men accepted it. It follows, then, that the later
        philosophers
      </p>
      <p>
        avoided the position that earth is a principle only because of the
        coarseness of its parts. But it is certain that earth has coarser parts
        than water, and water than air, and air than fire; and if there is any
        intermediate element, it is evident that it is grosser than fire. Hence
        by following this argument it is clear that none of them spoke
        correctly, except him who held that fire is the first principle. For as
        soon as some element is held to be a principle by reason of its
        minuteness, the most minute element must be held to be the first
        principle of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        187. <span style="font-weight: bold">However, if that which</span> (93).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives another argument, and according to it the opposite seems
        to be true, namely, that earth is the most basic element of things. For
        it is evident that whatever is subsequent in generation is prior in
        nature, because nature tends to the goal of generation as the first
        thing in its intention. But the denser and more composite something is,
        the later it appears in the process of generation; for the process of
        generation proceeds from simple things to composite ones, Just as mixed
        bodies come from the elements, and the humors and members [of a living
        body] from mixed bodies. Hence, whatever is more composite and condensed
        is prior in nature. In this way a conclusion is reached which is the
        opposite of that following from the first argument; i.e., water is now
        prior to air and earth to water as the first principle of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        188. It should be noted, however, that it is a different thing to look
        for what is prior in one and the same entity and for what is prior
        without qualification. For if one seeks what is prior without
        qualification, the perfect must be prior to the imperfect, just as
        actuality is prior to potentiality; because a thing is brought from a
        state of imperfection to one of perfection, or from potentiality to
        actuality, only by something completely actual. Therefore, if we speak
        of what is first in the whole universe, it must be the most perfect
        thing. But in the case of one particular thing which goes from
        potentiality to. complete actuality, potentiality is prior to actuality
        in time, although it is subsequent in nature. It is also clear that the
        first of all things must be one that is simplest; for the composite
        depends on the simple, and not the reverse. It was necessary, then, that
        the ancient philosophers should attribute both of these properties (the
        greatest perfection along with the greatest simplicity) to the first
        principle of the whole universe. However, these two properties cannot be
        attributed simultaneously to any corporeal principle, for in bodies
        subject to generation and corruption the simplest entities are
        imperfect. They were Compelled, then, as by contrary arguments, to posit
        different principles. Yet they preferred the argument of simplicity,
        because they considered things only insofar as something passes from
        potentiality to actuality, and in this order it is not necessary that
        anything which is a principle should be more perfect. But this kind of
        opposition can be resolved only by maintaining that the first principle
        of things is incorporeal, because this principle will be the simplest
        one, as Aristotle will prove below (2548).
      </p>
      <p>
        189. Last of all he concludes that for the purpose of the present
        discussion enough has been said about the positions of those who affirm
        one material cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        190. <span style="font-weight: bold">The same consequence</span> (94).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the arguments against those who posited many material
        causes. First, he argues against Empedocles; and second (194), against
        Anaxagoras (“But if anyone”).
      </p>
      <p>
        First (94), he says that the same consequence faces Empedocles, who held
        that the four [elemental] bodies are the matter of things, because he
        experienced the same difficulty with regard to the above contrariety.
        For according to the argument of simplicity fire would seem to be the
        most basic principle of bodies; and according to the other argument
        earth would seem to be such, as has been stated (187). And while
        Empedocles faced some of the same absurd conclusions as the preceding
        philosophers (i.e., he did not posit either a formal cause or
      </p>
      <p>
        the aforesaid contrariety of simplicity and perfection in corporeal
        things), there is no argument against him for doing away with the cause
        of motion. But he did face certain other absurd conclusions besides
        those that confronted the philosophers who posited one material cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        191. This is shown by three arguments, of which the first is as follows.
      </p>
      <p>
        First principles are not generated from each other, because a principle
        must always remain in existence, as is pointed out in Book I of the
        <i>Physics</i>. But we perceive that the four elements are
      </p>
      <p>
        generated from each other, and for this reason their generation is dealt
        with in natural philosophy. Hence his position that the four elements
        are the first principles of things is untenable.
      </p>
      <p>
        192.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">And concerning the cause</span> (95).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second absurdity, which has to do with the cause of
        motion. For to posit many and contrary causes of motion is not at all
        correct or reasonable; because if the causes of motion are understood to
        be proximate ones, they must be contraries, since their effects seem to
        be contraries. But if the first cause is understood, then it must be
        unique, as is apparent in Book XII (2492) of this work, and in Book VIII
        of the <i>Physics</i>. Therefore, since he intends to posit the first
        causes of motion, his position that they are contraries is untenable.
      </p>
      <p>193. <span style="font-weight: bold">And in general</span> (96).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument which leads to an absurdity: in every
        process of alteration it must be the same subject which undergoes
        contraries. This is true because one contrary does not come from another
        in such a way that one is converted into the other; for example, the
        cold does not come from the hot in such a way that heat itself becomes
        cold or the reverse, although the cold does come from the hot when the
        underlying subject is one only inasmuch as the single subject which is
        now the subject of heat is afterwards the subject of cold. But
        Empedocles did not hold that contraries have one subject. In fact he
        held that they are found in different subjects, as heat in fire and cold
        in water. Nor again did he hold that there is one nature underlying
        these two. Therefore he could not posit alteration in any way. Yet it is
        absurd that alteration should be done away with altogether.
      </p>
      <p>194. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if anyone</span> (97).</p>
      <p>
        Here he deals with Anaxagoras’ opinion; and in regard to this he does
        two things. First, he shows in general in what respect Anaxagoras’
        opinion should be accepted as true, and in what respect not. Second
        (97), he explains each of these in particular (“For to say”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first, that if anyone wishes to maintain that Anaxagoras’
        opinion is true insofar as he posited two principles, i.e., matter and
        efficient cause, let him understand this according to the reasoning
        which Anaxagoras himself seems to have followed, as if compelled by some
        need for truth, inasmuch as he would have followed those who expressed
        this theory. But “he himself has not stated it articulately”; i.e., he
        has not expressed it distinctly. Therefore, with reference to what he
        has not expressly stated his opinion is true; but with reference to what
        he has expressly stated his opinion is false.
      </p>
      <p>
        195. This is made clear in particular as follows. If his opinion is
        taken in its entirety according to a superficial understanding of his
        statements, a greater absurdity will appear for four reasons. First, his
        opinion that all things were mixed together at the beginning of the
        world is absurd; for in Aristotle’s opinion the distinction between the
        parts of the world is thought to be eternal. The second reason is this:
        what is unmixed is related to what is mixed as the simple to the
        composite. But simple bodies are prior to composite ones, and not the
        reverse. Therefore what is unmixed must be prior to what is mixed. This
        is the opposite of what Anaxagoras said. The third reason is this: in
        the case of bodies not anything at all is naturally disposed to be mixed
        with anything else, but only those things are naturally disposed to be
        mixed which are naturally inclined to pass over into each other by some
        kind of alteration; for a mixture is a union of the altered things which
        are capable of being mixed. But Anaxagoras held that anything is mixed
        with just anything. The fourth reason is this: there is both mixture and
        separation of the same things; for only those things are said to be
        mixed which are naturally disposed to exist apart. But properties and
        accidents are mixed with substances, as Anaxagoras said. Therefore it
        follows that properties and accidents can exist apart from substances.
        This is evidently false. These absurdities appear then, if Anaxagoras’
        opinion is considered in a superficial way.
      </p>
      <p>
        196. Yet if anyone were to follow him up “and articulate,” i.e.,
        investigate clearly and distinctly, the things which Anaxagoras “means,”
        i.e., what he intended, although he did not know how to express this,
        his statement would appear to be more astonishing and subtler than those
        of the preceding philosophers. This will be so for two reasons. First,
        he came closer to a true understanding of matter. This is clear from the
        fact that in that mixture of things, when nothing was distinguished from
        anything else but all things were mixed together, nothing could be truly
        predicated of that substance which is so mixed, which he held to be the
        matter of things. This is clear in the case of colors; for no special
        color could be predicated of it so that it might be said to be white or
        black or have some other color; because, according to this, that color
        would necessarily be unmixed with other things. Nor, similarly, could
        color in general be predicated of it so that it might be said to be
        colored; because everything of which a generic term is predicated must
        also have a specific term predicated of it, whether the predication be
        univocal or denominative. Hence, if that substance were colored, it
        would necessarily have some special color. But this is opposed to the
        foregoing statement. And the argument is similar with respect to
        “humors,” i.e., savors, and to all other things of this kind. Hence the
        primary genera themselves could not be predicated of it in such a way
        that it would have quality or quantity or some attribute of this kind.
        For if these genera were predicated of it, some particular species would
        necessarily belong to it. But this is impossible, if all things are held
        to be mixed together. For this species which would be predicated of that
        substance would already be distinguished from the others. And this is
        the true nature of matter, namely, that it does not have any form
        actually but is in potentiality to all forms. For the mixed body itself
        does not have actually any of the things which combine in its mixture,
        but has them only potentially. And it is because of this likeness
        between prime matter and what is mixed that he seems to have posited the
        above mixture; although there is some difference between the
        potentiality of matter and that of a mixture. For even though the
        elements which constitute a mixture are present in the mixture
        potentially, they are still not present in a state of pure passive
        potency; for they remain virtually in the mixture. This can be shown
        from the fact that a mixture has motion and operations as a result of
        the bodies of which the Mixture is composed. But this cannot be said of
        the things which are present potentially in prime matter. And there is
        also another difference, namely, that even though a mixture is not
        actually any of the mixed bodies which it contains, yet it is something
        actual. This cannot be said of prime matter. But Anaxagoras seems to do
        away with this difference, because he has not posited any particular
        mixture but the universal mixture of all things.
      </p>
      <p>
        197. The second reason is this: he spoke more subtly than the others,
        because he came closer to a true understanding of the first active
        principle. For he said that all things are mixed together except
        intellect, and that this alone is unmixed and pure.
      </p>
      <p>
        198. From these things it is clear that he posited two principles: one
        of these he claimed to be the intellect itself, insofar as it is simple
        and unmixed with other things; and the other is prime matter, which we
        claim is like the indeterminate before it is limited and participates in
        a form. For since [prime] matter is [the subject] of an infinite number
        of forms, it is limited by a form and acquires some species by means of
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        199. It is clear, then, that, in regard to the things which he stated
        expressly, Anaxagoras neither spoke correctly nor clearly. Yet he would
        seem to say something directly which comes closer to the opinions of the
        later philosophers, which are truer (namely, to those of Plato and
        Aristotle, whose judgments about prime matter were correct) and which
        were then more apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        200. In concluding Aristotle excuses himself from a more diligent
        investigation of these opinions, because the statements of these
        philosophers belong to the realm of physical discussions, which treat of
        generation and corruption. For these men usually posited principles and
        causes of this
      </p>
      <p>
        kind of substance, i.e., of material and corruptible substance. He says
        “usually,” because, while they did not treat other substances, certain
        of the principles laid down by them can also be extended to other
        substances. This is most evident in the case of intellect. Therefore,
        since they have not posited principles common to all substances, which
        pertains to this science, but only principles of corruptible substances,
        which pertains to the philosophy of nature, a diligent study of the
        foregoing opinions belongs rather to the philosophy of nature than to
        this science.<br />

      <p>
        98. But all those who make a study of all existing things, and who claim
        that some are sensible and others not, evidently make a study of both
        classes. And for this reason one should dwell at greater length on the
        statements they have made, whether they be acceptable or not, for the
        purposes of the present study which we now propose to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        99. Therefore, those who are called Pythagoreans used principles and
        elements which are foreign to the physicists; and the reason is that
        they did not take them from sensible things. For the objects of
        mathematics, with the exception of those that pertain to astronomy, are
        devoid of motion. Nevertheless they discuss and treat everything that
        has to do with the physical world; for they generate the heavens and
        observe what happens in regard to its parts, affections and operations.
        And in doing this they use up their principles and causes, as though
        they agreed with the others, i.e., the physicists, that whatever exists
        is sensible and is contained by the so-called heavens. But, as we have
        stated, the causes and principles [of which they speak] are sufficient
        to extend even to a higher class of beings, and are better suited to
        these than to their theories about the physical world.
      </p>
      <p>
        100. Yet how there will be motion if only the limited and unlimited and
        even and odd are posited as principles, they do not say. But how can
        there be generation or corruption, or the activities of those bodies
        which traverse the heavens, if there is no motion or change?
      </p>
      <p>
        101. And further, whether one grants them that continuous quantities
        come from these things, or whether this is demonstrated, how is it that
        some bodies are light and others heavy? For from what they suppose and
        state, they say nothing more about mathematical bodies than they do
        about sensible ones. Hence they have said nothing about fire, earth and
        other bodies of this kind, since they have nothing to say that is proper
        to sensible things.
      </p>
      <p>
        102. Further, how are we to understand that the attributes of number and
        number itself are [the causes] of what exists and comes to pass in the
        heavens, both from the beginning and now? And how are we to understand
        that there is no other number except that of which the world is
        composed? For when they [place] opportunity and opinion in one part of
        the heavens, and a little above or below them injustice and separation
        or mixture, and when they state as proof of this that each of these is a
        number, and claim that there already happens to be in this place a
        plurality of quantities constituted [of numbers], because these
        attributes of number correspond to each of these places, [we may ask]
        whether this number which is in the heavens is the same as that which we
        understand each [sensible] thing to be, or whether there is another kind
        of number in addition to this? For Plato says there is another. In fact,
        lie also thinks that both these things and their causes are numbers, but
        that some are intellectual causes and others sensible ones.

        Regarding the Pythagoreans, then, let us dismiss them for the present;
        for it is enough to have touched upon them to the extent that we have.

      <p>
        201. Here he argues dialectically against the opinions of Pythagoras and
        Plato, who posited different principles than those which pertain to the
        philosophy of nature. In regard to this he does two things. First, he
        shows that a study of these opinions rather than those mentioned above
        belongs to the present science. Second (202), he begins to argue
        dialectically against these opinions (“Therefore those who”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first (98), then, that those who “make a study,” i.e., an
        investigation, of all existing things, and hold that some are sensible
        and others non-sensible, make a study of both classes of beings. Hence
        an investigation of the opinions of those who spoke either correctly or
        incorrectly, belongs rather to the study which we now propose to make in
        this science. For this science deals with all beings and not with some
        particular class of being. Hence, the things which pertain to every
        class of being are to be considered here rather than those which pertain
        to some particular class of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        202. <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore those who</span> (99).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he argues against the opinions of the foregoing philosophers. First
        (99), he argues against Pythagoras; and second (208), against Plato
        (“But those who posited Ideas”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows in what way
        Pythagoras agreed with the philosophers of nature, and in what way he
        differed from them. Second (204), he argues against Pythagoras’ position
        (“Yet how”).
      </p>
      <p>
        We must understand (99), then, that in one respect the Pythagoreans
        agreed with the philosophers of nature, and in another respect they
        differed from them. They differed from them in their position regarding
        principles, because they employed principles of things in a way foreign
        to the philosophers of nature. The reason is that they did not take the
        principles of things from sensible beings, as the natural philosophers
        did, but from the objects of mathematics, which are devoid of motion,
        and are therefore not physical. And the statement that the objects of
        mathematics are devoid of motion must be referred to those sciences
        which are purely mathematical, such as arithmetic and geometry.
        Astronomy considers motion’ because astronomy is a science midway
        between mathematics and natural philosophy. For astronomy and the other
        intermediate sciences apply their principles to natural things, as is
        clear in Book II of the <i>Physics</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        203. Now Pythagoras agreed with the philosophers of nature concerning
        the things whose principles he sought; for he discussed and treated all
        natural beings. He dealt with the generation of the heavens, and
        observed everything that happens to the parts of the heavens, by which
        are meant the different spheres, or also the different stars. He also
        considered what happens to its affections, or to the eclipses of the
        luminous bodies; and what happens to the operations and motions of the
        heavenly bodies, and their effects on lower bodies. And he used up
        causes on particular things of this kind by applying to each one its
        proper cause. He also seemed to agree with’ the other philosophers of
        nature in thinking that that alone has being which is sensible and is
        contained by the heavens which we see. For he did not posit an infinite
        sensible body as the other philosophers of nature did. Nor again did he
        hold that there are many worlds, as Democritus did. He therefore seemed
        to think that there are no beings except sensible ones, because he
        assigned principles and causes only for such substances. However, the
        causes and principles which he laid down are not proper or limited to
        sensible things, but are sufficient for ascending to higher beings,
        i.e., intellectual ones. And they were better fitted to these than the
        theories of the natural philosophers which could not be extended beyond
        sensible things, because these philosophers claimed that principles are
        corporeal. But since Pythagoras posited incorporeal principles, i.e.,
        numbers, although he only posited principles of sensible bodies, he came
        very close to positing principles of intelligible beings, which are not
        bodies, as Plato did later on.
      </p>
      <p>204. <span style="font-weight: bold">Yet how</span> (100).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives three arguments against the opinion of Pythagoras. The
        first is this: Pythagoras could not explain how motion originates in the
        world, because he posited as principles only the limited and unlimited
        and the even and odd, which he held to be principles as substance, or
        material principles. But he had to admit that there is motion in the
        world. For how could there be generation and corruption in bodies, and
        how could there be any activities of the heavenly bodies, which occur as
        a result of certain kinds of motion, unless motion and change existed?
        Evidently they could not exist in any way. Hence, since Pythagoras
        considered generation and corruption and the operations of the heavenly
        bodies without assigning any principle of motion, his position is
        clearly unsatisfactory.
      </p>
      <p>205. <span style="font-weight: bold">And further</span> (101).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument. For Pythagoras claimed that
        continuous quantities are composed of numbers. But whether he proves
        this or takes it for granted, he could not give any reason on the part
        of numbers as to why some things are heavy and others light. This is
        clear from the fact that his theories about numbers are no more adapted
        to sensible bodies than they are to the objects of mathematics, which
        are neither heavy nor light. Hence they obviously said nothing more
        about sensible bodies than they did about the objects of mathematics.
        Therefore, since sensible bodies, such as earth and fire and the like,
        considered in themselves, add something over and above the objects of
        mathematics, it is evident that they said nothing proper in any true
        sense about these sensible bodies. Thus it is also evident that the
        principles which they laid down are not sufficient, since they neglected
        to give the causes of those [attributes] which are proper to sensible
        bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        206. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, how are we</span> (102).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument, which is based on the fact that
        Pythagoras seemed to hold two contrary [positions]. For, on the one
        hand, he held that number and the attributes of number are the cause
        both of those events which occur in the heavens and of all generable and
        corruptible things from the beginning of the world. Yet, on the other
        hand, he held that there is no other number besides that of which the
        substance of things is composed; for he held that number is the
        substance of things. But how is this to be understood, since one and the
        same thing is not the cause of itself? For Pythagoras says that the
        former position may be demonstrated from the fact that each one of these
        sensible things is numerical in substance; because in this part of the
        universe there are contingent beings, about which there is opinion, and
        which are subject to time inasmuch as they sometimes are and sometimes
        are not. But if generable and corruptible things were partly above or
        partly below, there would be disorder in the order of the universe:
        either after the manner of injustice, i.e., insofar as some being would
        receive a nobler or less noble place than it ought to have; or after the
        manner of separation, i.e., in the sense that, if a body were located
        outside its own place, it would be separated from bodies of a like
        nature; or after the manner of mixture and mingling, provided that a
        body located outside its proper place must be mixed with some other
        body, for example, if some part of water occupied a place belonging to
        air or to earth. In this discussion he seems to touch on two ways in
        which a natural body conforms to its proper place: one pertains to the
        order of position, according to which nobler bodies receive a higher
        place, in which there seems to be a kind of justice; and the other
        pertains to the similarity or dissimilarity between bodies in place, to
        which separation and mingling may be opposed. Therefore, insofar as
        things have a definite position, they are fittingly situated in the
        universe. For if their position were fitting would result, inasmuch as
        it has been stated and shown that all parts of the universe are arranged
        in a definite proportion; for every definite proportion is numerical.
        And it was from this that Pythagoras showed that all things would be
        numbers. But, on the other hand, we see that the continuous quantities
        established in different places are many and different, because the
        particular places in the universe correspond to the proper attributes by
        which bodies are differentiated. For the attributes of bodies which are
        above differ from those which are below. Hence, since Pythagoras by
        means of the above argument affirms that all sensible things are
        numbers, and we see that the difference in sensible bodies is
        attributable to difference in place, the question arises whether the
        number which exists “in the heavens” i.e., in the whole visible body
        which comprises the heavens, is merely the same as that which must be
        understood to be the substance of each sensible thing, or whether
        besides this number which constitutes the substance of sensible things
        there is another number which is their cause. Now Plato said that there
        is one kind of number which is the substance of sensible things, and
        another which is their cause. And while both Plato himself and
        Pythagoras thought that numbers are both sensible bodies themselves and
        their causes, Plato alone considered intellectual numbers to be the
        causes of things that are not sensible, and sensible numbers to be the
        causes and forms of sensible things. And since Pythagoras did not do
        this, his position is unsatisfactory.
      </p>
      <p>
        207. In concluding Aristotle says that these remarks about the
        Pythagoreans’ opinions will suffice; for it is enough to have touched
        upon them to this extent.<br />

        understanding of the causes of sensible things, introduced other
        principles equal in number to these—as though one who wishes to count
        things thinks that this cannot be done when they are few, but believes
        that he can count them after he has increased their number. For the
        separate Forms are almost equal to, or not fewer than, these sensible
        things in the search for whose causes these thinkers have proceeded from
        sensible things to the Forms. For to each thing there corresponds some
        homogeneous entity bearing the same name; and with regard to the
        substances of other things there is a one-in-many, both in the case of
        these sensible things and in those which are eternal.
      </p>
      <p>
        104. Furthermore, with regard to the ways in which we Prove that there
        are Forms, according to none of these do they become evident. For from
        some no syllogism necessarily follows, whereas from others there does;
        and [according to these] there are Forms of things of which we do not
        think there are Forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        105. For according to those arguments from [the existence of] the
        sciences there will be Forms of all things of which there are sciences;
        and according to the argument of the one-in-many there will also be
        Forms of negations.
      </p>
      <p>
        106. Again, according to the argument that there is some understanding
        of corruption, there will be Forms of corruptible things; for of these
        there is some sensible image.
      </p>
      <p>
        107. Again, according to the most certain arguments [for the Forms] some
        establish Forms of relations, of which they deny there is any essential
        class; whereas others lead to “the third man.”
      </p>
      <p>
        108. And in general the arguments for the Forms do away with the
        existence of the things which those who speak of the Forms are more
        anxious to retain than the Forms themselves. For it happens that the
        dyad [or duality] is not first, but that number is; and that the
        relative is prior to that which exists of itself. And all the other
        [conclusions] which some [reach] by following up the opinions about the
        Ideas are opposed to the principles [of the theory].
      </p>
      <p>
        109. Again, according to the opinion whereby we claim that there are
        Ideas [or Forms], there will be Forms not only of substances but also of
        many other things. For there is one concept not only in the case of
        substances but also in that of other things; and there are sciences not
        only of substance itself but also of other things. And a thousand other
        such [difficulties] face them.
      </p>
      <p>
        110. But according to logical necessity and the opinions about the
        Ideas, if the Forms are participated in, there must be Ideas only of
        substances. For they are not participated in according to what is
        accidental. But things must participate in each Form in this respect:
        insofar as each Form is not predicated of a subject. I mean that if
        anything participates in doubleness itself, it also participates in the
        eternal, but only accidentally; for it is an accident of doubleness to
        be eternal. Hence the Forms will be substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        111. But these things signify substance both here and in the ideal
        world; [otherwise] why is it necessary that a one-in-many appear in
        addition to these sensible things? Indeed, if the form of the Ideas and
        that of the things which participate in them are the same, there will be
        something in common. For why should duality be one and the same in the
        case of corruptible twos and in those which are many but eternal, rather
        than in the case of this [Idea of duality] and a particular two? But if
        the form is not the same, there will be pure equivocation; just as if
        one were to call both Callias and a piece of wood man, without observing
        any common attribute which they might have.

        208. Here he argues disputatively against Plato’s opinion. This is
        divided into two parts. First (208), he argues against Plato’s opinion
        with reference to his position about the substances of things; and
        second (259), with reference to his position about the principles of
        things (“And in general”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is divided into two parts. First, he argues against Plato’s
        position that the Forms are substances; and second (122:C 239), against
        the things that he posited about the objects of mathematics (“Further,
        if the Forms”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two thinks. First, he argues against this
        position of Plato; and second (210), against the reasoning behind it
        (“Furthermore, with regard to”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first (103), that the Platonists, in holding that the Ideas are
        certain separate substances, seemed to be at fault in that, when they
        sought for the causes of these sensible beings, they neglected sensible
        beings and invented certain other new entities equal in number to
        sensible beings. This seems to be absurd, because one who seeks the
        causes of certain things ought to make these evident and not add other
        things, the premising of which only adds to the number of points which
        have to be investigated. For it would be similar if a man who wished to
        count certain things which he did not think he was able to count because
        they are few, believed that he could count them by increasing their
        number through the addition of certain other things. But it is evident
        that such a man has a foolish motive, because the path is clearer when
        there are fewer things; for it is better and easier to make certain of
        fewer things than of many. And the smaller a number is, the more certain
        it is to us, inasmuch as it is nearer to the unit, which is the most
        accurate measure. And just as the process of counting things is the
        measure we use to make certain of their number, in a similar fashion an
        investigation of the causes of things is the accurate measure for making
        certain of their natures. Therefore, just as the number of fewer
        numerable things is made certain of more easily, n a similar way the
        nature of fewer things is made certain of more easily. Hence, when Plato
        increased the classes of beings to the extent that he did with a view to
        explaining sensible things, he added to the number of difficulties by
        taking what is more difficult in order to explain what is less
        difficult. This is absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
        209. That the Ideas are equal in number to, or not fewer than, sensible
        things, whose causes the Platonists seek (and Aristotle includes himself
        among their number because he was Plato’s disciple), and which they
        established by going from sensible things to the aforesaid Forms,
        becomes evident if one considers by what reasoning the Platonists
        introduced the Ideas. Now they reasoned thus: they saw that there is a
        one-in-many for all things having the same name. Hence they claimed that
        this one-in-many is a Form. Yet with respect to all substances of things
        other than the Ideas we see that there is found to be a one-in-many
        which is predicated of them univocally inasmuch as there are found to be
        many things which are specifically one. This occurs not only in the case
        of sensible things but also in that of the objects of mathematics, which
        are eternal; because among these there are also many things which are
        specifically one, as was stated above (157). Hence it follows that some
        Idea corresponds to each species of sensible things; and therefore each
        Idea is something having the same name as these sensible things, because
        the Ideas agree with them in name. For just as Socrates is called man,
        so also is the Idea of man. Yet they differ conceptually; for the
        intelligible structure of Socrates contains matter, whereas that of the
        ideal man is devoid of matter. or, according to another reading, each
        Form is said to be something having the same name [as these sensible
        things] inasmuch as it is a one-in-many and agrees with the things of
        which it is predicated so far as the intelligible structure of the
        species is concerned. Hence he says that they are equal to, or not fewer
        than, these things. For either there are held to be Ideas only of
        species, and then they would. be equal in number to these sensible
        things (granted that things are counted here insofar as they differ
        specifically and not individually, for the latter difference is
        infinite); or there are held to be ideas not only of species but also of
        genera, and then there would be more ideas than there are species of
        sensible things, because all species would be Ideas and in addition to
        these each and every genus [would be an Idea]. This is why he says that
        they are either not fewer than or more. Or, in another way, they are
        said to be equal inasmuch as he claimed that they are the Forms of
        sensible things. And he says not fewer than but more inasmuch as he held
        that they are the Forms not only of sensible things but also of the
        objects of mathematics.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Furthermore, with regard to</span>
        (104).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he argues dialectically against the reasoning behind Plato’s
        position; and in regard to this he does two things. First, he gives a
        general account of the ways in which Plato’s arguments fail. Second
        (211), he explains them in detail (“For according to those”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first, that with regard to the ways in which we Platonists
        prove the existence of the Forms, according to none of these are the
        Forms seen to exist. The reason is that “no syllogism follows”
        necessarily from some of these ways, i.e., from certain arguments of
        Plato, because they cannot demonstrate with necessity the existence of
        the Ideas. However, from other arguments a syllogism does follow,
        although it does not support Plato’s thesis; for by certain of his
        arguments there are proved to be Forms of certain things of which the
        Platonists did not think there are Forms, just as there are proved to be
        Forms of those things of which they think there are Forms.
      </p>
      <p>211. <span style="font-weight: bold">For according to</span> (105).</p>
      <p>
        Here he examines in detail the arguments by which the Platonists
        establish Ideas. First, he examines the second argument; and he does
        this by showing that from Plato’s argument it follows that there are
        Forms of some things for which the Platonists did not posit Forms.
        Second (225), he examines the first argument; and he does this by
        showing that Plato’s arguments are not sufficient to prove that Ideas
        exist (“But the most”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first member of this division he gives seven arguments.
        The first is this: one of the arguments that induced Plato to posit
        Ideas is taken from scientific knowledge; for since science is concerned
        with necessary things, it cannot be concerned with sensible things,
        which are corruptible, but must be concerned with separate entities
        which are incorruptible. According to the argument taken from the
        sciences, then, it follows that there are Forms of every sort of thing
        of which there are sciences. Now there are sciences not only of that
        which is one-in-many, which is affirmative, but also of negations; for
        just as there are some demonstrations which conclude with an affirmative
        proposition, in a similar way there are demonstrations which conclude
        with a negative proposition. Hence it is also necessary to posit Ideas
        of negations.
      </p>
      <p>
        212.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, according to the argument</span>
        (106).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument. For in the sciences it is not only
        understood that some things always exist in the same way, but also that
        some things are destroyed; otherwise the philosophy of nature, which
        deals with motion, would be destroyed. Therefore, if there must be ideas
        of all the things which are comprehended in the sciences, there must be
        Ideas of corruptible things as such, i.e., insofar as these are singular
        sensible things; for thus are things corruptible. But according to
        Plato’s theory it cannot be said that those sciences by which we
        understand the processes of corruption in the world attain any
        understanding of the processes of corruption in sensible things; for
        there is no comprehension of these sensible things, but only imagination
        or phantasy, which is a motion produced by the senses in their act of
        sensing, as is pointed out in <i>The Soul</i>, Book II.
      </p>
      <p>
        213.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, according to the most</span>
        (107).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument, which contains two conclusions that he
        says are drawn from the most certain arguments of Plato. One conclusion
        is this: if there are Ideas of all things of which there are sciences,
        and there are sciences not only of absolutes but also of things
        predicated relatively, then in giving this argument it follows that
        there are also Ideas of relations. This is opposed to Plato’s view. For,
        since the separate Ideas are things which exist of themselves, which is
        opposed to the intelligibility of a relation, Plato did not hold that
        there is a class of Ideas of relations, because the Ideas are said to
        exist of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        214. The second conclusion is one which follows from other most certain
        arguments, namely, that there is “a third man.” This phrase can be
        understood in three ways. First, it can mean that the ideal man is a
        third man distinct from two men perceived by the senses, who have the
        common name man predicated of both of them. But this does not seem to be
        what he has in mind, even though it is not mentioned in the
        <i>Sophistical Refutations</i>, Book II; for this is the position
        against which he argues. Hence according to this it would not lead to an
        absurdity.
      </p>
      <p>
        215. The second way in which this expression can be understood is this:
        the third man means one that is common to the ideal man and to one
        perceived by the senses. For since both a man perceived by the senses
        and the ideal man have a common intelligible structure, like two men
        perceived by the senses, then just as the ideal man is held to be a
        third man in addition to two men perceived by the senses, in a similar
        way there should be held to be another third man in addition to the
        ideal man and one perceived by the senses. But neither does this seem to
        be what he has in mind here, because he leads us immediately to this
        absurdity by means of another argument. Hence it would be pointless to
        lead us to the same absurdity here.
      </p>
      <p>
        216. The third way in which this expression can be understood is this:
        Plato posited three kinds of entities in certain classes of things,
        namely, sensible substances, the objects of mathematics and the Forms.
        He does this, for example, in the case of numbers, lines and the like.
        But there is no reason why intermediate things should be held to exist
        in certain classes rather than in others. Hence in the class of man it
        was also necessary to posit an intermediate man, who will be a third man
        midway between the man perceived by the senses and the ideal man.
        Aristotle also gives this argument in the later books of this work
        (2160).
      </p>
      <p>217. <span style="font-weight: bold">And in general</span> (108).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the fourth argument, which runs as follows. Whoever by his
        own reason he does away with certain [principles] which are better known
        to him than the ones which he posits, adopts an absurd position. But
        these theories about the Forms which Plato held do away with certain
        principles whose reality the Platonists (when they said that there are
        Ideas) were more convinced of than the existence of the Ideas. Therefore
        Plato’s position is absurd. The minor premise is proved in this way.
        According to Plato the Ideas are prior both to sensible things and to
        the objects of mathematics. But according to him the Ideas themselves
        are numbers; and they are odd numbers rather than even ones, because he
        attributed odd number to form and even number to matter. Hence he also
        said that the dyad [or duality] is matter. Therefore it follows that
        other numbers are prior to the dyad, which he held to be the matter of
        sensible things, and identified with the great and small. Yet the
        Platonists asserted the very opposite of this, that is to say, that the
        dyad is first in the class of number.
      </p>
      <p>
        218. Again, if, as has been proved by the above argument (213), there
        must be Ideas of relations, which are self-subsistent relations, and if
        the Idea itself is prior to whatever participates in the Idea, it
        follows that the relative is prior to the absolute, which is said to
        exist of itself. For sensible substances of this kind, which participate
        in Ideas, are said to be in an unqualified sense. And in like manner
        whatever those who follow the opinion about the Ideas say of all things
        is opposed to self-evident principles which even they themselves are
        most ready to acknowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        219.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, according to the opinion</span>
        (109).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the fifth argument, which is as follows: Ideas were
        posited by Plato in order that the intelligible structures and
        definitions of things given in the sciences might correspond to them,
        and in order that there could be sciences of them. But there is “one
        concept,” i.e., a simple and indivisible concept, by which the quiddity
        of each thing is known, i.e., not only the quiddity of substances “but
        also of other things,” namely, of accidents. And in a similar way there
        are sciences not only of substance and about substance, but there are
        also found to be sciences “of other things,” i.e., of accidents. Hence
        according to the opinion by which you Platonists acknowledge the
        existence of Ideas, it evidently follows that there will be Forms not
        only of substances but also of other things, i.e., of accidents. This
        same conclusion follows not only because of definitions and the
        sciences, but there also happen to be many “other such” [reasons], i.e.,
        very many.reasons why it is necessary to posit Ideas of accidents
        according to Plato’s arguments. For example, he held that the Ideas are
        the principles of being and of becoming in the world, and of many such
        aspects which apply to accidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        220. But, on the other hand, according to Plato’s opinion about the
        Ideas and according to logical necessity, insofar as the Ideas are
        indispensable to sensible things, i.e., “insofar” s as they are capable
        of being participated in by sensible things, it is necessary to posit
        Ideas only of substances. This is proved thus: things which are
        accidental are not participated in. But an Idea must be participated in
        by each thing insofar as it is not predicated of a subject. This becomes
        clear as follows: if any sensible thing participates in “doubleness
        itself,” i.e., in a separate doubleness (for Plato spoke of all
        separated things in this way, namely, as self-subsisting things), it
        must participate in the eternal. But it does not do this essentially
        (because then it would follow that any double perceived by the senses
        would be eternal), but accidentally, i.e., insofar as doubleness itself,
        which is participated in, is eternal. And from this it is evident that
        there is no participation in things which are accidental, but only in
        substances. Hence according to Plato’s position a separate Form was not
        an accident but only a substance. Yet according to the argument taken
        from the sciences there must also be Forms of accidents, as was stated
        above (219).
      </p>
      <p>221. <span style="font-weight: bold">But these things</span> (111).</p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the sixth argument, which runs thus: these sensible things
        signify substance both in the case of things perceived by the senses and
        in that of those in the ideal world, i.e., in the case of intelligible
        things, which signify substance; because they held that both
        intelligible things and sensible ones are substance. Therefore it is
        necessary to posit in addition to both of these substances—intelligible
        and sensible ones—some common entity which is a one-in-many. For the
        Platonists maintained that the Ideas exist on the grounds that they
        found a one-in-many which they believed to be separate from the many.
      </p>
      <p>
        222. The need for positing a one apart from both sensible substances and
        the Forms he proves thus: the Ideas and the sensible things which
        participate in them either belong to one class or not. If they belong to
        one class, and it is necessary to posit, according to Plato’s position,
        one common separate Form for all things having a common nature, then it
        will be necessary to Posit some entity common to both sensible things
        and the Ideas themselves) which exists apart from both. Now one cannot
        answer this argument by saying that the Ideas, which are incorporeal and
        immaterial, do not stand in need of any higher Forms; because the
        objects of mathematics, which Plato places midway between sensible
        substances and the Forms, are similarly incorporeal and immaterial. Yet
        since many of them are found to belong to one species, Plato held that
        there is a common Form for these things, in which not only the objects
        of mathematics participate but also sensible substances. Therefore, if
        the twoness [or duality] which is the Form or Idea of twoness is
        identical with that found in sensible twos, which are corruptible (just
        as a pattern is found in the things fashioned after it), and with that
        found in mathematical twos, which are many in one class (but are
        nevertheless eternal) ‘ then for the same reason in the case of the same
        twoness, i.e., the Idea two, and in that of the other twoness, which is
        either mathematical or sensible, there will be another separate twoness.
        For no reason can be given why the former should exist and the latter
        should not.
      </p>

        223. But if the other alternative is admitted—that sensible things,
        which participate in the Ideas, do not have the same form as the
        Ideas—it follows that the name which is predicated of both the Ideas and
        sensible substances is predicated in a purely equivocal way. For those
        things are said to be equivocal which have only a common name and differ
        in their intelligible structure. And it follows that they are not only
        equivocal in every way but equivocal in an absolute sense, like those
        things on which one name is imposed without regard for any common
        attribute, which are said to be equivocal by chance; for example, if one
        were to call both Callias and a piece of wood man.
      </p>
      <p>
        224. Now Aristotle added this because someone might say that a name is
        not predicated of an Idea and of a sensible substance in a purely
        equivocal way, since a name is predicated of an Idea essentially and of
        a sensible substance by participation. For, according to Plato, the Idea
        of man is called “man in himself,” whereas this man whom we apprehend by
        the senses is said to be a man by participation. However, such an
        equivocation is not pure equivocation. But a name which is predicated by
        participation is predicated with reference to something that is
        predicated essentially; and this is not pure equivocation but the
        multiplicity of analogy. However, if an Idea and a sensible substance
        were altogether equivocal by chance, it would follow that one could not
        be known through the other, as one equivocal thing cannot be known
        through another.<br />

        112. But the most important problem of all that one might raise is what
        the Forms contribute to sensible things, either to those which are
        eternal or to those which are generated and corrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
        113. For they are not the cause of motion or of any change whatever in
        these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        114. Nor are they of any assistance in knowing other things; for they
        are not the substance of other things, because if they were they would
        exist in them. Nor do they contribute anything to the being of other
        things; for they are not present in the things which participate in
        them. For if they were they would perhaps seem to be causes, as
        whiteness mixed with some white thing. But this theory, which was first
        stated by Anaxagoras and later by Hesiod and certain other thinkers, is
        easily disposed of. For it is easy to bring many absurd conclusions
        against such a view. In fact other things are not derived from the Forms
        in any of the customary senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        115. Again, to say that they are exemplars, and that other things
        participate in them, is to speak with empty talk and to utter poetic
        metaphors.
      </p>
      <p>
        116. For what is the work which looks towards the Ideas [as an
        exemplar]? For one thing may both be and become similar to another thing
        and not be made in likeness to it. So whether Socrates exists or not, a
        man such as Socrates might come to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        117. Similarly, it is evident that this will be the case even if
        Socrates is eternal. And there will be many exemplars of the same thing,
        and for this reason many Forms, as animal and two-footed and
        man-in-himself will be the Form of man.
      </p>
      <p>
        118. Further, the Forms will be the exemplars not only of sensible
        things but also of the Forms themselves, as the genus of the species.
        Hence the same thing will be both an exemplar and a copy.
      </p>
      <p>
        19. Again, it is thought to be impossible that the substance of a thing
        and that of which it is the substance should exist apart. Hence, if the
        Forms are the substances of things, how will they exist apart from them?
      </p>
      <p>
        120. But in the <i>Phaedo</i> it is stated that the Forms are the causes
        both of being and of coming to be. Yet even if the Forms do exist, still
        the things which participate in them will not come to be unless there is
        something which produces motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        121. And many other things come to be, such as a house and a ring, of
        which we do not say that there are any Forms. It is evident, then, that
        other things can exist and come to be because of such causes as those
        [responsible for the things] just mentioned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        225. Here Aristotle attacks the opinion of Plato insofar as he did not
        draw the conclusion which he intended to draw. For Plato intended to
        conclude that there are Ideas by this argument that they are necessary
        in some way for sensible things. Hence, Aristotle, by showing that the
        Ideas cannot contribute anything to sensible things, destroys the
        arguments by which Plato posits Ideas. Thus he says (112) that of all
        the objections which may be raised against Plato the foremost is that
        the Forms which Plato posited do not seem to contribute anything to
        sensible things, either to those which are eternal, as the celestial
        bodies, or to those which are generated and corrupted, as the elemental
        bodies. He shows (113) that this criticism applies to each of the
        arguments by which Plato posited Ideas (“For they are not”).
      </p>
      <p>
        226. At this point in the text (113) he begins to present his five
        objections [against the Platonic arguments for Ideas].
      </p>
      <p>
        He argues, first (226), that they are useless in explaining motion;
        second (227), that they are use
      </p>
      <p>
        less in explaining our knowledge of sensible things (“Nor are they”);
        third (231), that they are of no value as exemplars (“Again, to say”);
        fourth (236), that they are of no value as the substances of things
        (“Again, it is thought”); and fifth (237) that they are of no value as
        causes of generation (“But in the <i>Phaedo</i> ”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, he says, first (113), that the Forms cannot contribute
        anything to sensible things in such a way as to be the cause of motion
        or of any kind of change in them. He does not give the reason for this
        here but mentioned it above (237), because it is clear that the Ideas
        were not introduced to explain motion but rather to explain
        immutability. For since it seemed to Plato that all sensible things are
        always in motion, he wanted to posit something separate from sensible
        things that is fixed and immobile, of which there can be certain
        knowledge. Hence, according to him, the Forms could not be held to be
        sensible principles of motion, but rather to be immutable things and
        principles of immutability; so that, undoubtedly, whatever is found to
        be fixed and constant in sensible things will be due to participation in
        the Ideas, which are immutable in themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        227.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Nor are they of any assistance</span>
        (114).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he shows that the Forms do not contribute anything to the
        knowledge of sensible things, by the following argument: knowledge of
        each thing is acquired by knowing its own substance, and not by knowing
        certain substances which are separate from it. But these separate
        substances, which they call Forms, are altogether othef than sensible
        substances. Therefore a knowledge of them is of no assistance in knowing
        other sensible things.
      </p>
      <p>
        228. Nor can it be said that the Forms are the substances of these
        sensible things; for the substance of each thing is present in the thing
        whom substance it is. Therefore, if then Forms were the substances of
        sensible things, they would be present in sensible things. This is
        opposed to Plato’s opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        229. Nor again can it be said that the Forms are present in these
        sensible substances as in things which participate in them; for Plato
        thought that some Forms are the causes of sensible things in this way.
        For just as we might understand whiteness itself existing of itself as a
        certain separate whiteness to be mingled with the whiteness in a
        subject, and to participate in whiteness, in a similar way we. might say
        that man [in himself], who is separate, is mingled with this man who is
        composed of matter and the specific nature in which he participates. But
        this argument is easily “disposed of, ‘ i.e., destroyed; for Anaxagoras,
        who also held that forms and accidents are mingled with things, was the
        first to state it. Hesiod and certain other thinkers were the second to
        mention it. Therefore I say that it is easily disposed of, because it is
        easy to bring many absurd conclusions against such an opinion. For it
        would follow as he pointed out above (194) against Anaxagoras, that
        accidents and forms could exist without substances. For only those
        things can exist separately which are naturally disposed to be mixed
        with other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        230. It cannot be said, then, that the Forms contribute in any way to
        our knowledge of sensible things as their substances. Nor can it be said
        that they are the principles of being in these substances by way of
        participation. Nor again can it be said that from these Forms as
        principles other things—sensible ones—come to be in any of the ways in
        which we are accustomed to
      </p>
      <p>
        speak. Therefore, if principles of being and principles of knowledge are
        the same, the Forms cannot possibly make any contribution to scientific
        knowledge, since they cannot be principles of 1wing. Hence he says “in
        any of the customary ways” of speaking, because Plato invented many new
        ways of deriving knowledge of one thing from something else.
      </p>
      <p>231. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, to say</span> (115).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third objection against the arguments for separate
        Forms. He says that the Forms are of no value to sensible things as
        their exemplars. First (115), he states his thesis; and, second (232),
        he proves it (“For what is the work”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly he says, first (115), that to say that the Forms are the
        exemplars both of sensible things and the objects of mathematics
        (because the latter participate in causes of this kind), is untenable
        for two reasons. First, because it is vain and useless to posit
        exemplars of this kind, as he will show; and second, because this manner
        of speaking is similar to the metaphors which the poets introduce, which
        do not pertain to the philosopher. For the philosopher ought to teach by
        using proper causes. Hence he says that this manner of speaking is
        metaphorical, because Plato likened the generation of natural substances
        to the making of works of art, in which the artisan, by looking at some
        exemplar, produces something similar to his artistic idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        232. <span style="font-weight: bold">For what is the work</span> (116).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he proves his thesis by three arguments. For the work, i.e., the
        use, of an exemplar, seems to be this, that the artisan by looking at an
        exemplar induces a likeness of the form in his own artifact. But in the
        operations of natural beings we see that like things are generated by
        like, as man is generated by man. Therefore this likeness arises in
        things which are generated, either because some agent looks toward an
        exemplar or not. If not, then what is “the work,” or utility, of the
        agent’s so looking toward the Ideas as exemplars?—as if to say, none.
        But if the likeness results from looking at a separate exemplar, then it
        cannot be said that the cause of this likeness in the thing generated is
        the form of an inferior agent. For something similar would come into
        being with reference to this separate exemplar and not with reference to
        this sensible agent. And this is what he means when he says “and not be
        like it,” i.e., like the sensible agent. From this the following
        absurdity results: someone similar to Socrates will be generated whether
        Socrates is held to exist or not. This we see is false; for unless
        Socrates plays an active part in the process of generation, no one
        similar to Socrates will ever be generated. Therefore, if it is false
        that the likeness of things which are generated does not depend on
        proximate agents, it is pointless and superfluous to posit separate
        exemplars of any kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        233. However, it should be noted that, even though this argument does
        away with the separate exemplars postulated by Plato, it still does not
        do away with the fact that God’s knowledge is the exemplar of all
        things. For since things in the physical world are naturally inclined to
        induce their likeness in things which are generated, this inclination
        must be traced back to some directing principle which ordains each thing
        to its end. This can only be the intellect of that being who knows the
        end and the relationship of things to the end. Therefore this likeness
        of effects to their natural causes is traced back to an intellect as
        their first principle. But it is not necessary that this likeness should
        be traced back to any other separate forms; because in order to have the
        above-mentioned likeness this direction of things to their end,
        according to which natural powers are directed by the first intellect,
        is sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        234.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Similarly, it is evident</span> (117).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument, which runs as follows: just as
        Socrates because he is Socrates adds something to man, in a similar way
        man adds something to animal. And just as Socrates participates in man,
        so does man participate in animal. But if besides this Socrates whom we
        perceive there is held to be another Socrates who is eternal, as his
        exemplar, it will follow that there are several exemplars of this
        Socrates whom we perceive, i.e., the eternal Socrates and the Form man.
        And by the same reasoning the Form man will have several exemplars; for
        its exemplar will be both animal and two-footed and also
        “man-in-himself,” i.e., the Idea of man. But that there should be
        several exemplars of a single thing made in likeness to an exemplar is
        untenable. Therefore it is absurd to hold that things of this kind are
        the exemplars of sensible things.
      </p>
      <p>235. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further</span> (118).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument, which runs thus: just as a Form is
        related to an individual, so also is a genus related to a species.
        Therefore, if the Forms are the exemplars of individual sensible things,
        as Plato held, there will be also certain exemplars of these Forms, that
        is to say, their genus. But this is absurd, because then it would follow
        that one and the same thing, i.e., Form, would be an exemplar of one
        thing, namely, of the individual whom we perceive by the senses, and a
        copy made in likeness to something else, namely, a genus. This seems to
        be absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
        236. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, it is thought</span> (119).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he proves his fourth objection, namely, that the Forms contribute
        nothing to sensible things as their substances or formal causes; because
        “It is thought by him,” that is to say, it is a matter of opinion (to
        put this impersonally), that it is impossible for a thing’s substance to
        exist apart from the thing whose substance it is. But the Forms exist
        apart from the things of which they are the Forms, i.e., apart, from
        sensible things. Therefore they are not the substances of sensible
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        237. <span style="font-weight: bold">But in the “Phaedo”</span> (120).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that the Forms are of no value in accounting for the
        coming to be of sensible things, although Plato said “in the Phaedo,”
        i.e., in one of his works, that the Forms are the causes both of the
        being and of the coming to be of sensible things.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Aristotle disproves this by two arguments. The first is as follows:
        to posit the cause is to posit the effect. However, even if the Forms
        exist, the particular or individual things which participate in the
        Forms will come into being only if there is some agent which moves them
        to acquire form. This is evident from Plato’s opinion that the Forms are
        always in the same state. Therefore, assuming that these Forms exist, if
        individuals were to exist or come into being by participating in them,
        it would follow that individual substances of this kind would always be.
        This is clearly false. Therefore it cannot be said that the Forms are
        the causes of both the coming to be and the being of sensible things.
        The chief reason is that Plato did not hold that the Forms are efficient
        causes, as was stated above (226). For Aristotle holds that the being
        and coming to be of lower substances proceeds from immobile separate
        substances, inasmuch as these substances are the movers of the celestial
        bodies, by means of which generation and corruption are produced in
        these lower substances.
      </p>
      <p>238. <span style="font-weight: bold">And many other</span> (121).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument, which runs thus: just as artifacts
        are related to artificial causes, so are natural bodies to natural
        causes. But we see that many other things besides natural bodies come
        into being in the realm of these lower bodies, as a house and a ring,
        for which the Platonists did not posit any Forms. Therefore “other
        things,” namely, natural things, can both be and come to be because of
        such proximate causes as those just mentioned, i.e., artificial ones; so
        that, just as artificial things come to be as a result of proximate
        agents, so also do natural things.<br />

      </p>
      <p>
        122. Further, if the Forms are numbers, in what way will they be causes?
        Will it be because existing things are other numbers, so that this
        number is man, another Socrates, and still another Callias? In what
        respect, then, are the former the cause of the latter? For it will make
        no difference if the former are eternal and the latter are not. But if
        it is because the things here are ratios of numbers, like a harmony,
        then clearly there will be one kind of thing of which they are the
        ratios. And if this is matter, evidently the numbers themselves will be
        certain ratios of one thing to something else. I mean that, if Callias
        is a numerical ratio of fire, water, earth and air, [his Idea will also
        be a ratio of certain things], and man-in-himself, whether it be a
        number or not, will still be a numerical ratio of certain things and not
        just a number; nor will it be any number because of these.
      </p>
      <p>
        123. Again, one number will come from many numbers, but how or in what
        way can one Form come from [many] Forms?
      </p>
      <p>
        124. But if one number is not produced from them but from the units
        which they contain, as the units in the number ten thousand, how are the
        units related? For if they are specifically the same, many absurdities
        will follow; and if they are not, neither will they be the same as one
        another nor all the others the same as all.
      </p>
      <p>
        125. For in what way Will they differ, if they have no attributes? For
        these statements are neither reasonable nor in accord with our
        understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        126. Further, [if the Forms are numbers], it is necessary to set up some
        other class of number: that with which arithmetic deals. And all the
        things which an said to be intermediate, from what things or what
        principles in an absolute sense will they come, or why will they be [an
        intermediate class] between a the things at hand and those [in the ideal
        world]?
      </p>
      <p>
        127. Again, each of the units which are contained in the number two will
        come from a prior two. But this is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>128. Further, why is a number something composed of these?</p>
      <p>
        129. And, again, in addition to what has been said, if the units are
        different, it will be necessary to speak of them in the same way as do
        those who say that the elements are four or two. For none of them
        designate as an element what is common, namely, body, but fire and
        earth, whether body is something in common or not. But now we are
        speaking of the one as if it were one thing made up of like parts, as
        fire or water. But if this is the case, numbers will not be substances.
        Yet it is evident that, if the one itself is something common and a
        principle, then the one is used in different senses; otherwise this will
        be impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        130. Now when we wish to reduce substances to their principles, we claim
        that lengths come from the long and short, i.e., from a kind of great
        and small; and the plane from the wide and narrow; and body from the
        deep and shallow.
      </p>
      <p>
        131. Yet how will a surface contain a line, or a solid a line or
        surface? For the wide and narrow is a different class from the deep and
        shallow. Hence, just as number is not present in these, because the many
        and few differ from these, it is evident that no one of the other higher
        classes will be present in the lower. And the broad is not in the class
        of the deep, for then the solid would be a kind of surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        132. Further, from what will points derive being? Plato was opposed to
        this class of objects as a geometrical fiction, but he called them the
        principle of a line. And he often holds that there are indivisible
        lines. Yet these must have some [limit]. Therefore any argument that
        proves the existence of the line also proves the existence of the point.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        239. Here he destroys Plato’s opinion about the Forms inasmuch as Plato
        claimed that they are numbers. In regard to this he does two things.
        First, he argues dialectically against Plato’s opinion about numbers,
        and second (254), against his opinion about the other objects of
        mathematics (“Now when we wish”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first part he gives six arguments. The first (122) is
        this: in the case of things which are substantially the same, one thing
        is not the cause of another. But sensible things are substantially
        numbers according to the Platonists and Pythagoreans. Therefore, if the
        Forms themselves are numbers, they cannot be the cause of sensible
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        240. But if it is said that some numbers are Forms and others are
        sensible filings, as Plato literally held (as though We were to say that
        this number is man and another is Socrates and still another is
        Callias), even this would not seem to be sufficient; for according to
        this view the intelligible structure of number will be common both to
        sensible things and the Forms. But in the case of things which have the
        same intelligible structure, one does not seem to be the cause of
        another. Therefore the Forms will not be the causes of sensible things.
      </p>
      <p>
        241. Nor again can it be said that they are causes for the reason that,
        if those numbers are Forms, they are eternal. For this difference,
        namely, that some things differ from others in virtue of being eternal
        and non-eternal in their own being considered absolutely, is not
        sufficient to explain why some things are held to be the causes of
        others. Indeed, things differ from each other as cause and effect rather
        because of the relationship which one has to the other. Therefore things
        that differ numerically do not differ from each other as cause and
        effect because some are eternal and some are not.
      </p>
      <p>
        242. Again, it is said that sensible things are certain “ratios” or
        proportions of numbers, and that numbers are the causes of these
        sensible things, as we also observe to be the case “in harmonies,” i.e.,
        in the combinations of musical notes. For numbers are said to be the
        causes of harmonies insofar as the numerical proportions applied to
        sounds yield harmonies. Now if the above is true, then just as in
        harmonies there are found to be sounds in addition to numerical
        proportions, in a similar way it was obviously necessary to posit in
        addition to the numbers in sensible things something generically one to
        which the numerical proportions are applied, so that the proportions of
        those things which belong to that one genus would constitute sensible
        things. However, if that to which the numerical proportion in sensible
        things is applied is matter, evidently those separate numbers, which are
        Forms, had to be termed proportions of some one thing to something else.
        For this particular man, called Callias or Socrates, must be said to be
        similar to the ideal man, called “man-in-himself,” or humanity. Hence,
        if Callias is not merely a number, but is rather a kind of ratio or
        numerical proportion of the elements, i.e., of fire, earth, water and
        air, and if the ideal man-in-himself is a kind of ratio or numerical
        proportion of certain things, the ideal man will not be a number by
        reason of its own substance. From this it follows that there will be no
        number “apart from these,” i.e., apart from the things numbered. For if
        the number which constitutes the Forms is separate in the highest
        degree, and if it is not separate from things but is a kind of
        proportion of numbered things, no other number will now be separate.
        This is opposed to Plato’s view.
      </p>
      <p>
        243. It also follows that the ideal man is a proportion of certain
        numbered things, whether it is held to be a number or not. For according
        to those who held that substances are numbers, and according to the
        philosophers of nature, who denied that numbers are substances, some
        numerical proportions must be found in the substances of things. This is
        most evident in the case of the opinion of Empedocles, who held that
        each one of these sensible things is composed of a certain harmony or
        proportion [of the elements].
      </p>
      <p>
        244. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, one number</span> (123).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument which runs thus: one number is
        produced from many numbers. Therefore, if the Forms are numbers, one
        Form is produced from many Forms. But this is impossible. For if from
        many things which differ specifically something specifically one is
        produced, this comes about by mixture, in which the natures of the
        things mixed are not preserved; just as a stone is produced from the
        four elements. Again, from things of this kind which differ specifically
        one thing is not produced by reason of the Forms, because the Forms
        themselves are combined in such a way as to constitute a single thing
        only in accordance with the intelligible structure of individual things,
        which are altered in such a way that they can be mixed together. And
        when the Forms themselves of the numbers two and three are combined,
        they give rise to the number five, so that each number remains and is
        retained in the number five.
      </p>
      <p>
        245. But since someone could answer this argument, in support of Plato,
        by saying that one number does not come from many numbers, but each
        number is immediately constituted of units, Aristotle is therefore
        logical in rejecting this answer (124) (“But if one number”).
      </p>
      <p>
        For if it is said that some greater number, such as ten thousand, is not
        produced “from them,” namely, from twos or many smaller numbers, but
        from “units,” i.e., ones, this question will follow: How are the units
        of which numbers are composed related to each other? For all units must
        either conform with each other or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        246. But many absurd conclusions follow from the first alternative,
        especially for those who claim that the Forms are numbers. For it will
        follow that different Forms do not differ substantially but only insofar
        as one Form surpasses another. It also seems absurd that units should
        differ in no way and yet be many, since difference is a result of
        multiplicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        247. But if they do not conform, this can happen in two ways. First,
        they can lack conformity because the units of one number differ from
        those of another number, as the units of the number two differ from
        those of the number three, although the units of one and the same number
        will conform with each other. Second, they can lack conformity insofar
        as the units of one and the same number do not conform with each other
        or with the units of another number. He indicates this distinction when
        he says, “For neither will they be the same as one another (125),” i.e.,
        the units which comprise the same number, “nor all the others the same
        as all,” i.e., those which belong to different numbers. Indeed, in
        whatever way there is held to be lack of conformity between units an
        absurdity is apparent. For every instance of non-conformity involves
        some form or attribute, just as we see that bodies which lack conformity
        differ insofar as they are hot and cold, white and black, or in terms of
        similar attributes. Now units lack qualities of this kind, because they
        have no qualities, according to Plato. Hence it will be impossible to
        hold that there is any non-conformity or difference between them of the
        kind caused by a quality. Thus it is evident that Plato’s opinions about
        the Forms and numbers are neither “reasonable” (for example, those
        proved by an apodictic argument), nor “in accord with our understanding”
        (for example, those things which are self-evident and verified by [the
        habit of] intellect alone, as the first principles of demonstration).
      </p>
      <p>
        248.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, [if the Forms]</span> (126).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument against Plato, which runs thus: all
        objects of mathematics, which Plato affirmed to be midway between the
        Forms and sensible substances, are derived unqualifiedly from numbers,
        either as proper principles, or as first principles. He says this
        because in one sense numbers seem to be the immediate principles of the
        other objects of mathematics; for the Platonists said that the number
        one constitutes the point, the number two the line, the number three
        surface, and the number four the solid. But in another sense the objects
        of mathematics seem to be reduced to numbers as first principles and not
        as proximate ones. For the Platonists said that solids are composed of
        surfaces, surfaces of lines, lines of points, and points of units, which
        constitute numbers. But in either way it followed that numbers are the
        principles of the other objects of mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        249. Therefore, just as the other objects of mathematics constituted an
        intermediate class between sensible substances and the Forms, in a
        similar way it was necessary to devise some class of number which is
        other than the numbers that constitute the Forms and other than those
        that constitute the substance of sensible things. And arithmetic, which
        is one of the mathematical sciences, evidently deals with this kind of
        number as its proper subject, just as geometry deals with mathematical
        extensions. However, this position seems to be superfluous; for no
        reason can be given why number should be midway “between the things at
        hand,” or sensible things, and “those in the ideal world,” or the Forms,
        since both sensible things and the Forms are numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        250.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, each of the units</span> (127).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the fourth argument, which runs thus: those things which
        exist in the sensible world and those which exist in the realm of
        mathematical entities are caused by the Forms. Therefore, if some number
        two is found both in the sensible world and in the realm of the objects
        of mathematics, each unit of this subsequent two must be caused by a
        prior two, which is the Form of twoness. But it is “impossible” that
        unity should be caused by duality. For it would be most necessary to say
        this if the units of one number were of a different species than those
        of another number, because then these units would acquire their species
        from a Form which is prior to the units of that number. And thus the
        units of a subsequent two would have to be produced from a prior two.
      </p>
      <p>251. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, why is</span> (128).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the fifth argument, which runs thus: many things combine
        so as to constitute one thing only by reason of some cause, which can be
        considered to be either extrinsic, as some agent which unites them, or
        intrinsic, as some unifying bond. Or if some things are united of
        themselves, one of them must be potential and another actual. However,
        in the case of units none of these reasons can be said to be the one
        “why a number,” i.e., the cause by which a number, will be a certain
        “combination,” ‘ i.e., collection of many units; as if to say, it will
        be impossible to give any reason for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        252.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">And, again, in addition</span> (129).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the sixth argument, which runs thus: if numbers are the
        Forms and substances of things, it will be necessary to say, as has been
        stated before (245), either that units are different, or that they
        conform. But if they are different, it follows that unity as unity will
        not be a principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is clarified by a similar case drawn from the position of the
        natural philosophers. For some of these thinkers held that the four
        [elemental] bodies are principles. But even though being a body is
        common to these elements, these philosophers did not maintain that a
        common body is a principle, but rather fire, earth, water and air, which
        are different bodies. Therefore, if units are different, even though all
        have in common the intelligible constitution of unity, it will not be
        said that unity itself as such is a principle. This is contrary to the
        Platonists’ position; for they now say that the unit is the principle of
        things, just as the natural philosophers say that fire or water or some
        body with like parts is the principle of things. But if our conclusion
        against the Platonists’ theory is true-that unity as such is not the
        principle and substance of things-it will follow that numbers are not
        the substances of things. For number is held to be the substance of
        things only insofar as it is constituted of units, which are said to be
        the substances of things. This is also contrary to the Platonists’
        position which is now being examined, i.e., that numbers are Forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        253. But if you say that all units are undifferentiated, it follows that
        “the whole,” i.e., the entire universe, is a single entity, since the
        substance of each thing is the one itself, and this is something common
        and undifferentiated. Further, it follows that the same entity is the
        principle of all things. But this is impossible by reason of the notion
        involved, which is inconceivable in itself, namely, that all things
        should be one according to the aspect of substance. For this view
        contains a contradiction, since it claims that the one is the substance
        of all things, yet maintains that the one is a principle. For one and
        the same thing is not its own principle, unless, perhaps, it is said
        that “the one” is used in different senses, so that when the senses of
        the one are differentiated all things are said to be generically one and
        not numerically or specifically one.
      </p>
      <p>254. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now when we wish</span> (130).</p>
      <p>
        Here he argues against Plato’s position with reference to his views
        about mathematical extensions. First (130), he gives Plato’s position;
        and second (255), he advances an argument against it (“Yet how will”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first, that the Platonists, wishing to reduce the substances of
        things to their first principles, when they say that continuous
        quantities themselves are the substances of sensible things, thought
        they had discovered the principles of things when they assigned line,
        surface and solid as the principles of sensible things. But in giving
        the principles of continuous quantities they said that “lengths,” i.e.,
        lines, are composed of the long and short, because they held that
        contraries are the principles of all things. And since the line is the
        first of continuous quantities, they first attributed to it the great
        and small; for inasmuch as these two are the principles of the line,
        they are also the principles of other continuous quantities. He says
        “from the great and small” because the great and small are also placed
        among the Forms, as has been stated (217). But insofar as they are
        limited by position, and are thus particularized in the class of
        continuous quantities, they constitute first the line and then other
        continuous quantities. And for the same reason they said that surface is
        composed of the wide and narrow, and body of the deep and shallow.
      </p>
      <p>
        255.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Yet how will a surface</span> (130).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he argues against the foregoing position, by means of two
        arguments. The first is as follows. Things whose principles are
        different are themselves different. But the principles of continuous
        quantities mentioned above are different, according to the foregoing
        position, for the wide and narrow, which are posited as the principles
        of surface, belong to a different class than the deep and shallow, which
        are held to be the principles of body. The same thing can be said of the
        long and short, which differ from each of the above. Therefore, line,
        surface and body all differ from each other. How then will one be able
        to say that a surface contains a line, and a body a line and a surface?
        In confirmation of this argument he introduces a similar case involving
        number. For the many and few, which are held to be principles of things
        for a similar reason, belong to a different class than the long and
        short, the wide and narrow, and the deep and shallow. Therefore number
        is not contained in these continuous quantities but is essentially
        separate. Hence, for the same reason, the higher of the above mentioned
        things will not be contained in the lower; for example, a line will not
        be contained in a surface or a surface in a body.
      </p>
      <p>
        256. But because it could be said that certain of the foregoing
        contraries are the genera of the others, for example, that the long is
        the genus of the broad, and the broad the genus of the deep, he destroys
        this [objection] by the following argument: things composed of
        principles are related to each other in the same way as their principles
        are. Therefore, if the broad is the genus of the deep, surface will also
        be the genus of body. Hence a solid will be a kind of plane, i.e., a
        species of surface. This is clearly false.
      </p>
      <p>
        257.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, from what will</span> (132).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument, which involves points; and in regard
        to this Plato seems to have made two errors. First, Plato claimed that a
        point is the limit of a line, just as a line is the limit of a surface
        and a surface the limit of a body. Therefore, just as he posited certain
        principles of, which the latter are composed, so too he should have
        posited some principle from which points derive their being. But he
        seems to have omitted this.
      </p>
      <p>
        258. The second error is this: Plato seems to have held different
        opinions about points. For sometimes he maintained that the whole
        science of geometry treats this class of things, namely, points,
        inasmuch as he held that points are the principles and substance of all
        continuous quantities. And he not only implied this but even explicitly
        stated that a point is the principle of a line, defining it in this way.
        But many times he said that indivisible lines are the principles of
        lines and other continuous quantities, and that this is the class of
        things with which geometry deals, namely, indivisible lines. Yet by
        reason of the fact that he held that all continuous (quantities are
        composed of indivisible lines, he did not avoid the consequence that
        continuous quantities are composed of points, and that points are the
        principles of continuous quantities. For indivisible lines must have
        some limits, and these can only be points. Hence, by whatever argument
        indivisible lines are held to be the principles of continuous
        quantities, by the same argument too the point is held to be the
        principle of continuous quantity.<br />

        133. And, in general, even though wisdom investigates the causes of
        apparent things, we have neglected this study. For we say nothing about
        the cause from which motion originates. And while we think that we are
        stating the substance of these sensible things, we introduce other
        substances. But the way in which we explain how the latter are the
        substances of the former is empty talk; for to participate, as we have
        said before (115), signifies nothing. Moreover, that which we see to be
        the cause in the sciences, that by reason of which all intellect and all
        nature operates, on that cause which we say is one of the principles the
        Forms do not touch in any way. But mathematics has been turned into
        philosophy by present-day thinkers (566), although they say that

        they consider] as matter is too mathematical, and that it is rather a
        predicate and difference of substance and matter, like the great and
        small; just as the philosophers of nature speak of the rare and dense
        (56), which they say are the primary differences of the underlying
        subject; for “ these are a kind of excess and defect.
      </p>
      <p>
        135. And with regard to motion, if these entities [the great and small]
        are motion, evidently the Forms are moved; but if they are not, from
        what does motion come? For [if it has no cause], the whole study of
        nature is destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        136. And what seems easy to show is that all things are not one; for
        from their position all things do not become one. But if someone should
        assert that all things are some one thing, not even this is true unless
        one grants that the universal is a class; and in certain other cases
        this is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        137. For they do not have any theory about the lengths, widths, and
        solids which come after the numbers: either as to how they now exist or
        will exist, or what importance they have. For it is impossible that they
        should be Forms (since they are not numbers), or intermediate things
        (for those are the objects of mathematics), or corruptible things; but,
        on the contrary, it seems that they form a fourth class.
      </p>
      <p>
        138. And, in general, to look for the elements of existing things
        without distinguishing the different senses in which things are said to
        be, makes it impossible to discover them. And [their view is
        unsatisfactory] in another way, i.e., in the way in which they seek for
        the elements of which things are composed. For it is impossible to
        understand of what things action or passion or straightness is composed.
        But if this is possible only in the case of substances, then to look for
        the elements of all existing things, or to think that we have found
        them, is a mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        139. But how will one acquire knowledge of the elements of all things?
        For it is clearly impossible to have prior knowledge of anything. For
        just as one acquiring knowledge of geometry must have a prior knowledge
        of other things, but not of the things which this science
        [investigates], and which he is to learn, so it is in the case of the
        other sciences. Hence, if there is a science of all things (and there
        must be a science of these), as some say, the one learning this science
        does not have any prior knowledge of it. But all learning proceeds from
        things previously known, either all or some of them, whether the
        learning be by demonstration or by definitions. For [the parts] of which
        definitions are composed must already be known beforehand and be
        evident. The same thing is true in the case of things discovered by
        induction.
      </p>
      <p>
        140. But if this science were connatural, it is a wonder how we could be
        unconscious of having the most important of the sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
        141. Again, how is anyone to know the elements of which things are
        composed, and how is this to be made evident? For this also presents a
        difficulty; because one might argue in the same way as one does about
        certain syllables. For some say that <i>sma</i> is made up of <i>s</i>,
        <i>m</i> and <i>a</i>, whereas others say that it is a totally different
        sound and not any of those which are known to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        142. Again, how could one know the things of which a sense is cognizant
        without having that sense? Yet this will be necessary if they [i.e.,
        sensible things] are the elements of which all things are composed, just
        as spoken words are composed of their proper elements.

      <p style="text-align: center">Chapter 10</p>
      <p>
        143. From the foregoing, then, it is evident that all [the early
        philosophers] seem to seek the causes mentioned in the <i>Physics</i>,
        and that we cannot state any other in addition to these. But they
        understood these obscurely; and while in one sense all causes have been
        mentioned before, in another sense they have not been mentioned at all.
        Indeed, the earliest philosophy seems to speak in a faltering way about
        all subjects inasmuch as it was new as regards principles and the first
        of its kind. For even Empedocles says that ratios are present in bone,
        and that this is the quiddity or substance of a thing. But [if this is
        true], there must likewise be a ratio of flesh and of every other thing
        or of nothing. For it is because of this that flesh and bone and every
        other thing exists, and not because of their matter, which he says is
        fire, earth, air and water. But if someone else had said this, he would
        have been forced to agree to the same thing. But he has not said this.
        Such things as these, then, have been explained before. So let us return
        again to whatever problems one might raise about the same subject; for
        perhaps in the light of these we shall be able to make some
        investigation into subsequent problems.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        259. Here Aristotle destroys Plato’s opinion about the principles of
        things. First, he destroys Plato’s opinion about principles of being;
        and second (268), his opinion about principles of knowledge (“But how
        will one”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first part he gives six arguments. The first is based
        on the fact that Plato neglected to deal with the classes of causes.
        Thus he says that, “in general, wisdom,” or philosophy, has as its aim
        to investigate the causes “of apparent things,” i.e., things apparent to
        the senses. For men began to philosophize because they sought for the
        causes of things, as was stated in the prologue (53). But the
        Platonists, among whom he includes himself, neglected the principles of
        things, because they said nothing about the efficient cause, which is
        the source of change. And by positing the Ideas they thought they had
        given the formal cause of things. But while they thought that they were
        speaking of the substance of these things, i.e., sensible ones, they
        posited the existence of certain other separate substances which differ
        from these. However, the way in which they assigned these separate
        substances as the substances of sensible things “is empty talk,” i.e.,
        it proves nothing and is not true. For they said that the Forms are the
        substances of sensible things inasmuch as they are participated in by
        sensible things. But what they said about participation is meaningless,
        as is clear from what was said above (225). Furthermore, the Forms which
        they posited have no connection with the final cause, although we see
        that this is a cause in certain sciences which demonstrate by means of
        the final cause, and that it is by reason of this cause that every
        intellectual agent and every natural one operates, as has been shown in
        the <i>Physics</i>, Book II. And just as they do not touch on that cause
        which is called an end [or goal], when they postulate the existence of
        the Forms (169), neither do they treat of that cause which is called the
        source of motion, namely, the efficient cause, which is the opposite, so
        to speak, of the final cause. But the Platonists by omitting causes of
        this kind (since they did omit a starting-point and end of motion), have
        dealt with natural things as if they were objects of mathematics, which
        lack motion. Hence they said that the objects of mathematics should be
        studied not only for themselves but for the sake of other things, i.e.,
        natural bodies; inasmuch as they attributed the properties of the
        objects of mathematics to sensible bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        260. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, one might</span> (134).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument, which runs thus: that which is
        posited as the matter of a thing is the substance of a thing, and is
        predicable of a thing to a greater degree than something which exists
        apart from it. But a Form exists apart from sensible things. Therefore,
        according to the opinion of the Platonists, one might suppose that the
        underlying substance as matter is the substance of the objects of
        mathematics rather than a separate Form. Furthermore, he admits that it
        is predicated of a sensible thing rather than the above Form. For the
        Platonists held that the great and small is a difference of substance or
        matter; for they referred these two principles to matter, just as the
        philosophers of nature (115) held that rarity and density are the
        primary differences of the “underlying subject,” or matter, by which
        matter is changed, and spoke of them in a sense as the great and small.
        This is clear from the fact that rarity and density are a kind of excess
        and defect. For the dense is what contains a great deal of matter under
        the same dimensions, and the rare is what contains very little matter.
        Yet the Platonists said that the Forms are the substance of sensible
        things rather than the objects of mathematics, and that they are
        predicable of them to a greater degree.
      </p>
      <p>261. <span style="font-weight: bold">And with regard</span> (135).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument, which runs thus: if those attributes
        which exist in sensible things are caused by separate Forms, it is
        necessary to say either that there is an Idea of “motion” among the
        Forms or there is not. If there is a Form or Idea of motion among the
        Forms, and there cannot be motion without something that is moved, it
        also follows that the Forms must be moved. But this is opposed to the
        Platonists’ opinion, for they claimed that the Forms are immobile. On
        the other hand, if there is no Idea of motion, and these attributes
        which exist in sensible things are caused by the Ideas, it will be
        impossible to assign a cause for the motion which occurs in sensible
        things; and thus the entire investigation of natural philosophy, which
        studies mobile things, will be destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        262. <span style="font-weight: bold">And what seems easy</span> (136).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the fourth argument, which runs thus: if unity were the
        substance of all things, as the Platonists assumed, it would be
        necessary to say that all things are one, just as the philosophers of
        nature also did in claiming that the substance of all things is water,
        and so on for the other elements. But it is easy to show that all things
        are not one. Hence the position that unity is the substance of all
        things is not held in high repute.
      </p>
      <p>
        263. But let us assume that someone might say that it does not follow,
        from Plato’s position, that all things are one in an unqualified sense
        but in a qualified sense, just as we say that some things are one
        generically or specifically. And if someone wished to say that all
        things are one in this way, even this could be held only if what I call
        the one were a genus or universal predicate of all things. For then we
        could say that all things are one specifically, just as we say that both
        a man and an ass are animal substantially. But in certain cases it seems
        impossible that there should be one class of all things, because the
        difference dividing this class would necessarily not be one, as will be
        said in Book III (432). Therefore, in no way can it be held that the
        substance of all things is one.
      </p>
      <p>
        264. <span style="font-weight: bold">For they do not have</span> (137).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the fifth argument, which runs thus: Plato placed lengths,
        widths and solids after numbers as the substances of sensible things,
        i.e., that of which they are composed. But according to Plato’s position
        there seems to be no reason why they should be held to exist either now
        or in the future. Nor does this notion seem to have any efficacy to
        establish them as the causes of sensible things. For things which exist
        “now” must mean immobile things (because these always exist in the same
        way), whereas things which “will exist” must mean those which are
        capable of generation and corruption, which acquire being after
        non-being. This becomes clear thus: Plato posited three classes of
        things—sensible things, the Forms and the objects of mathematics, which
        are an intermediate class. But such lines and surfaces as those of which
        sensible bodies are composed cannot be Forms; for the Forms are
        essentially numbers, whereas such things [i.e., the lines and surfaces
        composing bodies] come after numbers. Nor can such lines and surfaces be
        said to be an intermediate class between the Forms and sensible things;
        for the things in this intermediate class are the objects of
        mathematics, and exist apart from sensible things; but this cannot be
        said of the lines and surfaces of which sensible bodies are composed.
        Nor again can such lines and surfaces be sensible things; for the latter
        are corruptible, whereas these lines and surfaces are incorruptible, as
        will be proved below in Book III (466). Therefore these things are
        either nothing at all or they constitute a fourth class of things, which
        Plato omitted.
      </p>
      <p>265. <span style="font-weight: bold">And, in general</span> (138).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the sixth argument, which runs thus: it is impossible to
        discover the principles of anything that is spoken of in many senses,
        unless these many senses are distinguished. Now those things which agree
        in name only and differ in their intelligible structure cannot have
        common principles; otherwise they would have the same intelligible
        structure, since the intelligible structure of a thing is derived from
        its own principles. But it is impossible to assign distinct principles
        for those things which have only the name in common, unless it be those
        whose principles must be indicated to differ from each other. Therefore,
        since being is predicated both of substance and the other genera in
        different senses and not in the same sense, Plato assigned inadequate
        principles for things by failing to distinguish beings from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        266. But since someone could assign principles to things which differ in
        their intelligible structure and have a common name, by adjusting proper
        principles to each without distinguishing the many senses of the common
        name, and since the Platonists have not done this, then “in another
        way,” i.e., by another argument, they assigned inadequate principles to
        things when they looked for the elements of which things are made, i.e.,
        in the way in which they sought for them, inasmuch as they did not
        assign principles which are sufficient for all things. For from their
        statements it is impossible to understand the principles of which either
        action and passion, curvature and straightness, or other such accidents,
        are composed. For they only indicated the principles of substances and
        neglected accidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        267. But if in defense of Plato someone wished to say that it is
        possible for the elements of all things to have been acquired or
        discovered at the moment when the principles of substances alone happen
        to have been acquired or discovered, this opinion would not be true. For
        even if the principles of substances are also in a sense the principles
        of accidents, nevertheless accidents have their own principles. Nor are
        the principles of all genera the same in all respects, as will be shown
        below in Book XI (2173) and Book XII (2455) of this work.
      </p>
      <p>268. <span style="font-weight: bold">But how will one</span> (139).</p>
      <p>
        Here he argues dialectically against Plato’s position that the Ideas are
        the principles of our scientific knowledge. He gives four arguments, of
        which the first is this: if our scientific knowledge is caused by the
        Ideas themselves, it is impossible for us to acquire knowledge of the
        principles of things. But it is evident that we do acquire knowledge.
        Therefore our knowledge is not caused by the Ideas themselves. That it
        would be impossible to acquire knowledge of anything, he proves thus: no
        one has any prior knowledge of that object of which he ought to acquire
        knowledge; for example, even though in the case of geometry one has
        prior knowledge of other things which are necessary for demonstration,
        nevertheless the objects of which he ought to acquire knowledge he must
        not know beforehand. The same thing is also true in the case of the
        other sciences. But if the Ideas are the cause of our knowledge, men
        must have knowledge of all things, because the Ideas are the
        intelligible structures of all knowable things. Therefore we cannot
        acquire knowledge of anything) unless one might be said to acquire
        knowledge of something, which he already knew. if it is held, then, that
        someone acquires knowledge, he must not have any prior knowledge of the
        thing which he comes to know, but only of certain other things through
        which he becomes instructed; i.e., one acquires knowledge through things
        previously known, [either] “all,” i.e., universals, “or some of them,”
        i.e.,:singular things. One learns through universals in the case of
        those things which are discovered by demonstration and definition, for
        in the case of demonstrations and definitions the things of which
        definitions or universals are composed must be known first. And in the
        case of things which are discovered by induction singular things must be
        known first.
      </p>
      <p>
        269. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if this, science</span> (140).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument, which runs thus: if the Ideas are the
        cause of our knowledge, it must be connatural to us; for men grasp
        sensible things through this proper nature, because sensible things
        participate in Ideas according to the Platonists. But the most important
        knowledge or science is one that is connatural to us and which we cannot
        forget, as is evident of our knowledge of the first principles of
        demonstration, of which no one is ignorant. Hence there is no way in
        which we can forget the knowledge of all things caused in us by the
        Ideas. But this is contrary to the Platonists’ opinion, who said that
        the soul as a result of its union with the body forgets the knowledge
        which it has of all things by nature, and that by teaching a man
        acquires knowledge of something that he previously knew, as though the
        process of acquiring knowledge were merely one of remembering.
      </p>
      <p>
        270. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, how is anyone</span> (141).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument, which runs thus: in order to know
        things a man must acquire knowledge not only of the forms of things but
        also of the material principles of which they are composed. This is
        evident from the fact that occasionally questions arise regarding these;
        for example, with regard to this syllable <i>sma</i>, some raise the
        question whether it is composed of the three letters <i>s</i>,
        <i>m</i> and <i>a</i>, or whether it is one letter which is distinct
        from these and has its own sound. But only the formal principles of
        things can be known through the Ideas, because the Ideas are the forms
        of things. Hence the Ideas are not a sufficient cause of our knowledge
        of things when material principles remain unknown.
      </p>
      <p>271. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, how could</span> (142).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the fourth argument, which runs thus: in order to know
        reality we must know sensible things, because sensible things are the
        apparent material element of which all things are composed, just as
        complex sounds (such as syllables and words) are composed of their
        proper elements. If, then, knowledge is caused in us by the Ideas, our
        knowledge of sensible things must be caused by the Ideas. But the
        knowledge which is caused in us by the Ideas is grasped without the
        senses, because we have no connection with the Ideas through the senses.
        Therefore in the act of perception it follows that anyone who does not
        have a sense can apprehend the object of that sense. This is clearly
        false; for a man born blind cannot have any knowledge of colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        272. <span style="font-weight: bold">From the foregoing</span> (143).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he summarizes the statements made by the ancient philosophers. He
        says that from what has been said above it is evident that the ancient
        philosophers attempted to investigate the cause which he [Aristotle]
        dealt with in the <i>Physics</i>, and that in their statements we find
        no cause in addition to those established in that work. However, these
        men discussed these causes obscurely; and while in a sense they have
        mentioned all of these causes, in another sense they have not mentioned
        any of them. For just as young children at first speak imperfectly and
        in a stammering way, in a similar fashion this philosophy, since it was
        new, seems to speak imperfectly and in a stammering way about the
        principles of all things. This is borne out by the fact that Empedocles
        was the first to say that bones have a certain ratio, or proportional
        mixture [of the elements], and that this is a thing’s quiddity or
        substance. But the same thing must also be true of flesh and of every
        other single thing or of none of them, for all of these things are
        mixtures of the elements. And for this reason it is evident that flesh
        and bone and all things of this kind are not what they are because of
        their matter, which he identified with the four elements, but because of
        this principle-their form. However, Empedocles, compelled as it were by
        the need for truth, would have maintained this view if it had been
        expressed more clearly by someone else, but he did not express it
        clearly. And just as the ancient philosophers have not clearly expressed
        the nature of form, neither have they clearly expressed the nature of
        matter, as was said above about Anaxagoras (90). Nor have they clearly
        expressed the nature of any other principles. Therefore, concerning such
        thing, as have been stated imperfectly, we have spoken of this before
        (190). And with regard to these matters we will restate again in Book
        III (423) whatever difficulties can be raised on both sides of the
        question. For perhaps from such difficulties we will discover some
        useful information for dealing with the problems which must be examined
        and solved later on throughout this whole science.
