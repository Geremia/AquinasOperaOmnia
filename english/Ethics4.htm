    But the intemperate are sometimes accused of extravagance by inference, for
    the incontinent and the intemperate are notorious as extravagant wasters.
    For this reason, too, they seem to be very depraved; indeed they have many
    vices. However, they are not properly called prodigal, for a spendthrift is
    a man who has acquired one vice, that of wasting his substance (he is ruined
    by his own fault). The dissipation of one’s substance seems to be a kind of
    ruin of one’s being, since a man lives by means of riches. It is in this

  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    649. Having completed the study of fortitude and temperance which deals with
    means preservative of human life itself, he now begins to examine other
    mediums which concern certain subsidiary goods and evils. First he defines
    the laudable mediums which are the virtues. Then [Lect. 17], at “Shame is
    not properly spoken of etc.” (B. 1128 b 10), he defines the mediums that are
    not virtues but passions. On the first point he does two things. Initially,
    he considers the virtues that regard external things. Next [Lect. 14], at
    “Some men seem to be etc.” (B. 1126 b 10), he considers the virtues
    pertaining to human actions. In regard to the first point he considers the
    virtues relating to riches. Second [Lect. 8], at “Judging by the name etc.”
    (B. 1123 a 33), he considers the virtues having to do with honors. He
    handles the initial point in two ways. First he considers liberality. Then
    [Lect. 7, at “it seems logical etc.” (B. 1122 a 18), he investigates
    magnificence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The first point he subdivides in a twofold manner. Initially [I] he examines
    the matter of liberality and the opposite vices. Next [II], at “Things that
    have utility etc.,” he defines their acts concerned with the proper matter.
    He discusses the initial point from two aspects. First [I, A] he shows that
    liberality has to do with wealth. Then [I, B], at “Extravagance is the
    excess etc.,” he shows that there are opposite vices dealing with this
    matter. The first point is developed in three ways. Initially [I, A, A’] he
    says what his intention is. Next [A, B’], at “which seems to be a mean
    etc.,” he shows the matter of liberality. Last [A, C’], at “Wealth here
    etc.,” he explains what he had said.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    650. After the treatise on temperance, he says first that we must take up
    the study of liberality because of the likeness between liberality and
    temperance. As temperance moderates the desires of tactile pleasures, so
    liberality moderates the desire of acquiring or possessing external goods.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    651. At “which seems” [A, B’] he defines the matter of liberality, saying
    that it is a certain mean in regard to wealth. This is obvious from the fact
    that a man is praised as liberal not in military affairs (with which
    fortitude is concerned), nor in tactile pleasures (temperance has to do with
    these), nor in judgments (which are matters for justice). But he is praised
    for the giving and taking, i.e., the acceptance of wealth—more in giving
    than in taking, as will be shown afterwards (660, 661, 665, 666, 683).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    652. We must consider that something can be called the matter of moral
    virtue in two ways: in one way as the proximate matter (thus the passions
    are the matter of many moral virtues); in the other way, as the remote
    matter (thus the objects of the passions are called their matter).
    Accordingly the proximate matter of fortitude is fear and recklessness; the
    remote matter, the fear of death; the proximate matter of temperance is
    desires and pleasures but the remote matter is food, drink, and sexual acts.
    Hence we find that the proximate matter of liberality is desire or love of
    wealth, and the remote matter is wealth itself.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    653. Then [A, C’], at “Wealth here,” he explains what is understood by the
    name “wealth,” saying that the term signifies everything the value of which
    can be computed in dollars and cents, like a horse, a coat, a house, or
    whatever can be evaluated in cash. The reason is that to give or take these
    objects is the same as to give or take wealth.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    654. At “Extravagance is” [I, B] he shows in what manner there are vices
    contrary to liberality. Here he makes the following points. First [B, A’] he
    states his general intention, saying that extravagance and miserliness in
    the use of wealth are denominated such by excess and defect.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    655. Next [B, B’], at “Miserliness is always,” he mentions particularly that
    we always connect or charge with miserliness people who are more diligent,
    i.e., solicitous, about making or keeping wealth than they ought to be.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    656. Finally [B, C’], at “But the intemperate” he explains in what manner
    extravagance may be concerned with wealth. By extension the term
    “extravagance” is applied occasionally to the intemperate, for men who live
    riotously and dissipate their riches by overindulgence in food and sex are
    sometimes called spendthrifts. Hence they seem very depraved in the sense
    that they also possess many vices, like intemperance and extravagance.
    Although such men at times may be called extravagant, nevertheless they do
    not strictly deserve the name that is used to signify a vice consisting in
    inordinate waste or consumption of one’s substance or riches. He proves the
    statement by the name “extravagance.” The extravagant person is spoken of as
    ruined inasmuch as dissipation of his own riches, by which he ought to live,
    seems to destroy his existence-a thing sustained by riches.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    657. This name should be predicated of a man in relation to himself because
    each thing receives its species and name from what pertains to it
    essentially. Therefore a man is truly called extravagant who dissipates his
    riches precisely because he does not have proper care of them. On the other
    hand, he who wastes his substance for some other reason, for example,
    intemperance, is not essentially a spendthrift but an intemperate person. It
    happens now and then that even the covetous and grasping waste their goods
    because of the influence of concupiscence. For the present then we are
    treating extravagance according as some squander riches themselves and do
    not waste them in some other way.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    658. Then [II], at “Things that have,” he explains in what way liberality
    and the opposite vices function in this matter. Here he takes up two (three)
    points, considering first [II, A] the liberal man; next [Lect. 3; II, B] the
    spendthrift, at “But the spendthrift etc.” (B. 1120 b 25); and finally
    [Lect. 5; II, C], the miser, at “Illiberality etc.” (B. 1121 b 13). He
    treats the first point from two aspects. First [II, A, A’] he examines the
    act of liberality; then [Lect. 2; II, A, B’], he states certain
    characteristics of it at “The liberal person however” (B. 1120 b 5). He
    discusses the first point in a twofold manner. First [A’, 1] he shows what
    the principal act of liberality is; and next [Lect. 2; A’, 2], what
    qualities this act should have, at “Since virtuous actions” (B. 1120 a 23).
    He handles the initial point under two headings. First [i, a] he makes clear
    that the act of liberality is the proper use of wealth, by the following
    argument. Whatever has any utility can be used well or badly. But riches are
    sought because they have some utility. Therefore they can be used well or
    badly. Now the proper use of things pertains to that virtue which deals with
    those things. Consequently, the proper use of wealth belongs to liberality,
    which is concerned with wealth, as we proved before (651-653).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    659. Next [1, b ], at “The spending,” he explains what the use of wealth is,
    indicating that it consists in spending which takes place by disbursements
    and gifts. To accept or save wealth is not to use it, for acceptance brings
    about possession, and saving is the preservation of wealth; acceptance is a
    kind of production, and saving is an habitual retention. Use, however, does
    not signify production or habit but act.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    660. Finally [1, c], at “For this reason,” he draws a conclusion from what
    has been said. First [c, i] he states it, inferring from the premises that
    it is more characteristic of a liberal man to distribute wealth to the right
    persons than to accept wealth from the proper sources (this pertains to a
    lawful increase of wealth), and to refuse wealth from improper sources (this
    pertains to removal of the contrary).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    661. Then [c, ii], at “Virtue consists,” he substantiates the conclusion by
    five reasons. The first reason [ii, v] is that it is more characteristic of
    virtue to bestow than to receive benefits because the act of benefitting is
    better and more difficult. Likewise, it is more characteristic of virtue to
    perform a good action than to refrain from an evil one, because departure
    from a terminus is the principle of motion to which the avoidance of an evil
    action is likened. But the performance of a good action is likened to the
    arrival at the goal which perfects motion. It is obvious when someone gives
    gifts that he bestows a benefit and performs a good action. On the other
    hand, it pertains to taking or acceptance to receive benefits worthily
    (inasmuch as a man acquires them from proper sources), and not to act
    unworthily (inasmuch as a man refuses them from improper sources).
    Consequently, it belongs to the virtue of liberality to give well rather
    than to receive worthily or refrain from reprehensible acceptance of gifts.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    662. The second reason [ii, w], at “Thanks and,” follows. Praise and thanks
    are due in return for a good act. But each one of these is ascribed with
    better reason to the giver than the receiver, worthy or unworthy. Therefore,
    the virtue of liberality consists rather in giving than receiving.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    663. The third reason is presented at “Likewise it is easier” [ii, x].
    Virtue is concerned with the difficult. But it is easier not to receive what
    belongs to others than to give what is one’s own because a person giving
    what is his cuts himself away, so to speak, from what was a part of him.
    Therefore, the virtue of liberality more property has to do with giving than
    receiving.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    664. The fourth reason, beginning at “People who” [ii, y], is taken from
    common usage. Men who give gifts are said to be liberal in a marked degree;
    those who do not accept dishonest gifts are commended not so much for
    liberality as justice, and those who simply accept presents are praised very
    little. Therefore, the virtue of liberality seems to be concerned in a
    special way with giving gifts.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    665. The fifth reason is given at “Of all virtuous men” [ii, z]. Among all
    virtuous men the liberal person is especially loved not by an honorable
    friendship—as if liberality was a most excellent virtue—but by a friendship
    of utility precisely as he is useful to others. The liberal are indeed
    useful in this that they make disbursements. Therefore, liberality deals
    especially with giving gifts.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        666. After the Philosopher has made clear what the principal act of
        liberality is, he now [(II, A, A’)2] shows what its qualities should be.
        First [2, a] he explains the quality of the principal act; and next [2,
        b] the qualities of the secondary acts, at “Nor will a liberal man
        accept.” In regard to the initial point he does two things. First [a, i]
        he shows what should be the quality of giving which is the principal act
        of liberality. Then [a, ii] he shows that other kinds of donations do
        not pertain to liberality, at “The man, however, etc.” He treats the
        first point in a twofold manner. First [i, x] he explains that the
        giving of the liberal man should be endowed with circumstances because
        all virtuous operations ought to be good, directed by reason according
        to the required circumstances and ordered to a good end. Since, then,
        giving is the principal act of liberality, it follows that the liberal
        man should give with rectitude of intention and of deed, i.e., in
        conformity with the norm of reason. This means that he bestows on the
        proper person, in a fitting manner and according to all other requisite
        circumstances called for by right reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        667. Next [i, y], at “Besides, he will give with pleasure,” he shows
        that the giving of a liberal person should be enjoyable. This is what he
        means saying that the liberal man gives cheerfully, or at least without
        sadness. It is true of any virtue, as evident in previous discussions
        (265-279, 371-378), that virtuous action is either pleasurable or at
        least without sadness. If the virtuous man has some sadness mingled with
        his activity, it will be very slight compared with what other men
        suffer. This was said before in regard to the brave man who, even if he
        does not take much pleasure in his operation, nevertheless is not made
        sad or at least has less sadness than anyone who undergoes trials of
        this kind in his activities.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        668. Then [a, ii], at “The Man, however,” he brings out that other
        donations do not pertain to the liberal man. First [ii, x] he
        says—speaking of disbursements that lack the proper circumstances—that
        one who gives to the wrong persons, or not for an honorable motive but
        for some other reason, good or bad, is not called liberal. But he is
        given a different name according to the difference of the end for which
        he gives, since moral matters take their species and name from the end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        669. Second [ii, y], at “Nor will anyone,” he affirms that a man who
        gives with sadness is not liberal. The reason is that the cheerless
        giver seems to prefer wealth to the virtuous action of honorable
        giving—which is not the case with a liberal person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        670. Next [2, b], at “Nor will a liberal man accept,” he explains the
        nature of the secondary acts of liberality like receiving and so on.
        Here he makes two points, showing first what the liberal person avoids
        in accepting; and then [b, ii] what he should observe, at “He will take
        etc.” On the first point he makes two comments. The first is that the
        liberal man does not take from improper sources, for to take in this way
        does not seem becoming to a man who does not highly prize wealth. The
        second is that the liberal man is not quick to make requests. As in the
        natural order, what is greatly active has little receptivity, for
        example, fire, so in the moral order the liberal person, who is prompt
        in making benefactions, is not eager to accept benefits from others,
        i.e., to be easily receptive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        671. Then [b, ii], at “He will take,” Aristotle shows what the liberal
        man should observe in taking and retaining. He makes three observations,
        of which the first is that the liberal man takes from the proper
        sources, i.e., from his own possessions and not from others, since he
        seeks wealth not as a good itself but as something necessary for making
        gifts. The second is that he does not neglect the care of his own goods
        because he wants to have enough to bestow on others. The third is that
        he does not give to everyone but holds back so he can give to the right
        persons at a fitting place and time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        672. Then [B’], at “The liberal person,” he states four properties of
        liberality. The first [B’, 1] is that it pertains to the liberal person
        to give eagerly and generously, not however without right reason but in
        such a way that what he gives is more than what he retains, because he
        keeps less for himself than he gives to others. He is indeed content
        with a few things for himself but if he wants to care for many people,
        he must distribute much more. It is not a mark of the generous man to
        have himself alone in mind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        673. At “Liberality makes allowance” he gives the second property [B’,
        2], saying that liberality is attributed according to the relative
        quantity of a man’s substance or riches. Hence there is no reason why
        someone who bestows smaller gifts may not be judged more liberal, if he
        gives from more moderate means.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        674. He presents the third property at “People who inherit” [B’, 3],
        affirming that persons who inherit riches from their parents are more
        liberal than those who acquire them by their own labor. He assigns two
        reasons for this. The first is that people who are given wealth by their
        parents have never felt the pinch of need. Consequently, they are not
        afraid to spend, as those are who have experienced poverty at one time.
        The second reason is that all men naturally love their own works;
        parents love their children, and poets, their poems. Likewise, those who
        acquire riches by their labor look upon them as their own works and
        rather desire to keep them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        675. He presents the fourth property at “It is not easy” [B’, 4]. He
        considers this point under three aspects. First [4, a] he indicates the
        property, saying that the liberal man is not easily made rich, since he
        is not disposed to accept or keep riches but rather to distribute them
        in gifts and disbursements. Nor does he value riches for themselves but
        for their distribution.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        676. Next [4, b], at “Men bring the accusation,” he makes clear by a
        certain sign what he had said. Since the liberal do not readily become
        wealthy, the common people blame fortune—to which they attribute
        riches—because those who would be especially deserving (i.e., the
        liberal who give generously to others) are not rich. But Aristotle says
        that this is not an unreasonable occurrence, for it is not possible that
        a person should possess wealth who troubles himself very little about
        it, just as it is not possible that anything else which a man does not
        care for should be retained.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        677. Finally [4, c] he excludes a false opinion at “The liberal man,
        however, will not.” It was not said that the liberal man does not care
        about riches because he gives to the wrong person, or at the wrong time,
        or in the wrong manner according to some other circumstance. The reason
        is both that such an operation would not be liberal and that the liberal
        person would be hindered in this way from truly generous action, for by
        reason of useless waste he would lack the means to make the most worthy
        disbursements. As has been explained (658-659), he is called liberal,
        then, who gives donations in the proper manner and according to the
        condition of his own resources.

        Likewise he will accept both large and small amounts from the proper
        sources and under the proper conditions. Since virtue consists in the
        mean regarding both (taking and giving), he will do both as he ought
        because virtuous taking goes hand in hand with virtuous giving, while
        improper taking is contrary to virtuous giving. Accordingly, the

        We have seen that extravagance and miserliness pertain to excess and

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        678. After the Philosopher has finished the study of the liberal man, he
        now [(II)B] begins the consideration of the spendthrift. First [A’] he
        treats the person who is altogether extravagant; and next [Lect. 4, B’]
        the person who is partly extravagant and partly liberal at “But, as we
        have noted etc.” (B. 1121 a 30). In regard to the first, lie does two
        things. Initially [1] he considers the spendthrift as such. Then [2] he
        makes a comparison between the spendthrift and the miser, at “We have
        seen etc.” He clarifies the initial point by a twofold distinction.
        First [1, a] he shows in what respect the spendthrift is excessive; and
        next [1, b], of what nature his act is, at “Since liberality is the mean
        etc.” Although I man may be called liberal when he spends according to
        his means, he is called extravagant when he spends or gives beyond his
        means. From this he concludes that tyrants, who have an inexhaustible
        supply of wealth-usurping as they do public goods for themselves-are not
        called extravagant. The reason is that it is not easy for tyrants to
        exceed the amount of their riches by donations and expenditures because
        of the great amount of their possessions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        679. Then [i, b], at “Since liberality.” he discloses what the act of
        the spendthrift is. Because opposites are mutually revealing, he first
        [b, i] resumes what was said about the act of the liberal man. Next [b,
        ii], he shows how the act of the spendthrift is constituted, at “The
        spendthrift, however, etc.” On the first point he proceeds in two ways.
        First [i, x] he reviews how the liberal man should conduct himself in
        the matters principally pertaining to him, i.e., in giving and in the
        pleasure of giving; and next [i, A in matters secondarily pertaining to
        him, at “Likewise he will accept.” He says first that, since liberality
        is a certain dealing with giving and taking of wealth, the liberal
        person, disposes of his funds by making gifts and disbursements—and this
        in agreement with right reason—in the proper way, of the proper things,
        and according to other appropriate circumstances. By this the liberal
        man is distinguished from the spendthrift; by the fact that he gives
        both in large and small amounts he is distinguished from the munificent
        man, who is concerned only with great donations; by the fact that he
        gives with pleasure he differs from the miser who is saddened by the
        giving away of his wealth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        680. Next [i, y], at “Likewise he will accept,” Aristotle reviews the
        way the liberal man should act in matters which secondarily pertain to
        liberality. He touches first [y, aa] on the liberal man’s reaction to
        taking; and next [y, bb], to sadness at “If it should etc.” He says
        first that the liberal person accepts from the proper sources and
        observes all proper conditions. Since the virtue of liberality abides by
        the golden mean in regard to both, i.e., taking and giving, the liberal
        man will perform both as he ought-worthy acceptance going hand in hand
        with worthy giving. But acceptance that is not virtuous is contrary to
        virtuous giving because the two proceed from contrary causes. Virtuous
        giving proceeds from the fact that a man prefers the reasonable good to
        the desire for wealth. But dishonorable taking arises from placing the
        desire of wealth before the reasonable good. Things that go hand in hand
        exist at the same time in the same subject, but not things that are
        contrary. Hence virtuous giving and taking that accompany one another
        are united in the liberal person, but dishonorable taking is not found
        in him together with virtuous taking, its contrary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        681. Then [y, bb], at “If it should,” he explains how the liberal man
        reacts to sadness arising from the loss of wealth. He develops this
        point in three steps. First [bb, a’] he shows in what manner the liberal
        person is saddened by disordered giving, affirming that if some of his
        own money be lost by reason of foolish spending and unfortunate
        conditions, he becomes sad as any virtuous man is saddened by doing
        something contrary to virtue. In this sorrow, however, he observes the
        rule of reason with moderation and as he should. The reason is that it
        is characteristic of the virtuous person to be delighted and to be
        saddened by the right thing and in the right manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        682. Next [bb, b’], at “But the liberal man,” he shows how the generous
        person is saddened by the privation of wealth, saying that he is
        disposed to share his wealth, i.e., is inclined to possess it in common,
        as it were, with others. He can, without grief, permit someone to injure
        him in money matters because he does not attach great importance to
        wealth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        683. Third [bb, c’], at “He is more grieved,” he discloses in what
        manner the liberal man is grieved at inappropriate retention of money,
        explaining that he is more grieved or saddened over not using his wealth
        in gifts or expenditures than over spending something which he should
        not have spent. The reason is that he is more concerned with giving than
        taking and keeping, although this would not please Simonides, a certain
        poet, who said we ought to do the opposite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        684. Then [b, ii], at “The spendthrift, however,” he explains by the
        premises how the act of the spendthrift is constituted, saying that the
        spendthrift sins in all the preceding matters, i.e., not only in giving
        and accepting but also in taking pleasure
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        and grieving because he is neither delighted nor saddened by the right
        things and in the right way. This will be made clearer by what follows.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        685. Next [2], at “We have seen,” he compares extravagance to
        miserliness in regard, first [2, a] to opposition; and second [Lect. 4,
        (A’, 2), b] to the gravity of the sin, at “The things that” (B. 1121 a
        16). He affirms, as was noted before (654), that extravagance and
        miserliness are constituted by excess and defect in two things, viz.,
        taking and giving. He says this because expenditures, which pertain to
        liberality, are included under giving. And it is precisely in
        expenditures that the spendthrift and the miser exceed and fall short in
        opposite things. The spendthrift is excessive in giving and in not
        taking. But the miser, on the contrary, is deficient in giving and
        excessive in taking, except perhaps in trifling things that he gives and
        does not care to take.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        686. After the Philosopher has explained the opposition between
        extravagance and miserliness, he now shows [b] that miserliness is the
        more serious fault for three reasons. The first reason [b. i] is taken
        from the mutability of extravagance: although not readily increased it
        is easily eliminated. Hence he says that the things belonging to
        extravagance cannot at the same time be increased very much, so that a
        person takes nothing and gives to everyone because resources or riches
        are quickly exhausted for those who spend recklessly, like the simple
        and senseless. And spendthrifts seem to be of this type. Since then a
        vice, which is not increased very much but easily remedied, is not so
        serious, it: follows that the spendthrift is somewhat better, i.e., less
        evil than the miser.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        687. The spendthrift is easily cured of his vice in two ways. In the
        first way by age because the older a man grows the more inclined he is
        to keep things and not give them away. The reason is that riches are
        desired to supply the needs of man, and as these needs become greater so
        a man is more prone to husband and not hand out his wealth. Second, the
        spendthrift is cured by poverty resulting from excessive giving, for
        poverty prevents extravagant spending both by reason of the
        impossibility of further giving and the experience of need.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        688. At “He can attain” [b, ii] he gives the second reason, which is
        based on the likeness of extravagance to liberality. Hence he says that
        the spendthrift can easily be directed to the mean of virtue on account
        of the similarity he has with the liberal man. Since the spendthrift
        generously gives and does not readily take, he has qualities possessed
        by the liberal person. But he differs from the liberal man in not doing
        either of these actions properly and as he ought, i.e., according to
        right reason. Therefore, if he is induced to perform these things as he
        ought, either by custom or by some change in age or fortune he will
        become liberal so that he will give to the right persons and not take
        from the wrong sources.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        689. He concludes from this that the spendthrift does not seem to be
        evil precisely as it pertains to moral virtue, which directly regards
        the power of the appetite. It is not characteristic of an evil or
        perverted appetite or of an effeminate mind to give excessively and not
        to take. This belongs rather to a kind of stupidity. Thus it seems that
        extravagance does not belong so much to moral depravity, which regards
        the inclination of the appetite to evil, as to a lack of common sense.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        690. At “In this way” [b, iii] he presents the third reason taken from a
        defect in extravagance. That the spendthrift is much better than the
        miser is apparent not only from the two reasons already stated but also
        from a third, namely, the spendthrift helps many by his giving, although
        he may hurt himself by giving extravagantly. The miser, on the other
        hand, benefits no one for he fails in giving; he does not benefit even
        himself, for he fails in spending.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        691. Then [II, B’], at “But, as we have noted,” he considers the man who
        is a blend of spendthrift and miser. First [1] he shows in what manner
        some spendthrifts have a bit of illiberality. Next [2] he draws some
        conclusions from what has been said, at “Therefore.” On the initial
        point he first [1, a] explains how some spendthrifts sin in taking; and
        then [1, b] how they conduct themselves in giving, at “For these
        reasons.” In regard to this first, he presents his proposition [a, i],
        saying that many who are extravagant in unnecessary donations are also
        ungenerous in some way, taking as they do from the wrong sources.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        692. Next [a, ii], at “They are inclined” he assigns two reasons. The
        first is that spendthrifts are disposed to take because they want to
        spend their goods in superfluous gifts and expenditures. They readily
        succeed in this, for their resources are quickly depleted. Hence, in
        order that they may satisfy their desire regarding unnecessary gifts and
        disbursements, they are forced to acquire dishonestly from some other
        place the means they do not possess.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        693. The second reason is that they give rather out of a desire of
        giving than according to right reason, tending, as it were, to some
        good. They want to give presents but it makes no difference to them how
        or whence these come. Consequently, they do not concern themselves about
        what is right and so take from any source without distinction.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        694. Then [i, b], at “For these reasons,” he explains how spendthrifts
        may be at fault in making donations. He declares that, because they do
        not care about what is right, their gifts are neither liberal nor good,
        either in motive or circumstance. But sometimes they make rich evil men
        who would be better off poor-men who abuse their riches and thereby
        cause harm both to themselves and others. Yet they would give nothing to
        men who regulate their lives according to virtue. Thus they are
        deficient in giving. They are, however, generous with sycophants or
        others who give them pleasure in any way whatsoever, e.g., buffoons or
        panderers. In this way they go to excess in giving.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        695. Next [2], at “Therefore,” he draws two conclusions from the
        premises. The first [2, a] is that many spendthrifts are intemperate.
        This is evident first, because (being inclined to spend), they readily
        waste their substance by intemperance in food and sex, from which many
        people are restrained by fear of the cost. Second, because they do not
        order their life to an honorable good, consequently they turn aside to
        the pleasures of sense. These two (the honorable and the pleasurable)
        are desirable in themselves—the honorable according to rational desire,
        the pleasurable according to sensual desire. The useful refers to both.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        696. He draws the second conclusion [2, b], at “The spendthrift,”
        pointing out what is clear from the premises: that if the spendthrift
        cannot be attracted to virtue, he falls into the previously mentioned
        vices. But if he possesses zeal for virtue, he will easily attain the
        mean so that he will give and refrain from taking according to what he
        ought, as was stated before (688).

        Likewise illiberality can greatly increase, and is very diversified
        since many species of it seem to exist. It is made up of two elements,
        namely, deficient giving and needless grasping, which are sometimes
        found separately and not always together in all 20 subjects. Some indeed
        are always getting and others never giving.

        refrain from what is not theirs for fear that their taking of what
        belongs to others should make it easy for others to take what is theirs.
        Therefore, they are content neither to give nor to take.

        Others again are immoderate in their taking by accepting anything and
        from any quarter, for example, those who engage in disreputable
        enterprises, those who live from the proceeds of prostitution, and such
        like, and usurers who lend small sums and at high rates. All of these
        receive more than they should and from reprehensible sources. Common to
        them is sordid gain because they all become infamous for the sake of a
        little money. People who wrongly take great sums from wrong sources are
        not called illiberal, for instance, usurpers who plunder cities and
        despoil sacred places but rather wicked, impious, and unjust.

        Among the illiberal, however, we count the gambler, the despoiler of the
        dead and the robber—shameful profit-makers. For the sake of evil gain,
        these engage in occupations having the stamp of infamy. Some run the
        risk of very great danger for gain, while others would take from friends
        to whom they should give. In both cases, those wishing to enrich
        themselves are makers of shameful profit. It is clear then that all
        taking of this kind is opposed to liberality.

        Appropriately then illiberality is said to be the vice opposed to
        liberality, for it is a graver evil than extravagance. Likewise men sin
        more by illiberality than by extravagance. So far, therefore, we have
        discussed liberality and the opposite vices.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        697. After the Philosopher has finished the treatise on extravagance, he
        now [(II)C] treats illiberality, examining it under three headings.
        First [A’] he states a quality of illiberality. Next [B’], he
        distinguishes the modes, i.e., the species of illiberality, at “Likewise
        etc.” Last [C’], he makes a comparison of illiberality with its opposite
        ar “Appropriately then etc.” He says first that illiberality is
        incurable, and assigns two reasons for this. The first reason is that
        human life, and even earthly things, tend to be defective for the most
        part. It is obvious from experience that old age and every other
        disability or defect make a man parsimonious, because it seems to him
        that he is very much in need. Therefore, he has a great desire for
        external things that supply the wants of man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        698. The second reason is this. That to which man is naturally inclined
        cannot easily be removed from him. But man is more inclined to
        illibtrality than extravagance. A sign of this is that more lovers and
        custodians of money exist than donors. What is natural is found in the
        majority of cases. And nature inclines to the love of riches to the
        extent that man’s life is preserved by them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        699. Then [B’], at “Likewise,” he distinguishes the modes or species of
        illiberality. On this point he does three things. First [i] he shows
        that illiberality is considered from two aspects, viz., excess in
        getting and defect in giving. Next [2], at “All those who,” he gives the
        species which are understood according to deficiency in giving. Last
        [3], at “Others again,” he gives the species that are able to be
        distinguished according to unnecessary taking. He says first that
        illiberality is increased greatly; it extends to a multitude of things
        and is diversified inasmuch as there are many kinds of illiberality.
        Although illiberality may exist in two forms, defect of giving and
        excess of taking, not all illiberal people sin in both ways as though
        they possessed the whole nature of illibcrality. But it is found
        separately in various persons so that some abound in taking who
        nevertheless do not fall short in dispensing, like the spendthrift
        previously considered (678). Others, however, fall short in dispensing
        and, notwithstanding, do not abound in taking.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        700. Next [2], at “All those who,” he sets down the types of persons who
        are deficient in giving. He says that some are called stingy who spend
        very little; others are called grasping who retain nearly everything
        from a defect in giving. Still others are called closefisted, or
        cumin-splitters from an excessive tenacity they manifest in refusing to
        give the smallest thing without a return. However, these are not
        excessive in taking because they do not covet the goods of others, nor
        do they care much about accepting gifts. This happens for two reasons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        701. The first reason is that they pass up these opportunities out of
        moral consideration and fear of turpitude. They seem to keep what is
        theirs—they even say so expressly—lest, if they give what they have,
        they may be forced sometimes to a shameful act because of need.
        Likewise, they are unwilling to accept the goods of others since they
        think it dishonorable. They even hesitate lest they be induced to
        something unsecinly by those who gave to them. Among these seem to be
        the skinflint or the cumin-splitter, so named because he has an aversion
        to giving anyone even a tiny seed. The same reason holds in all similar
        cases.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        702. The second reason is that some refrain from taking other people’s
        goods because they fear they may have to give, as if it were not easy
        for men to take the things that belong to others and others not to take
        the things which are theirs. On this account they are content neither to
        give nor to take.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        703. Then [3], at “Others again,” he mentions the species of
        illiberality in regard first [3, a ], to those who take in a disgraceful
        way; and next [3, b], who take in an unjust way, at “Among the
        illiberal.” He says first that certain illiberal persons are immoderate
        in taking, not caring what or whence they take or profit. Some benefit
        from cheap and servile operations. Others, like pimps, make profit from
        sordid and unlawful dealing, e.g., prostitution and the like. Still
        others enrich themselves by unjust exaction, for instance, usurers and
        those who want at least a little gain from a large gift or loan. All
        these receive from reprehensible sources, i.e., mean or shameful works,
        or they receive more than they should, like usurers who take more than
        the interest. All have profit, and this paltry, in common. nose who make
        enormous profits, and make them b y shameful means—they are considered
        disgraceful for this reason—are not called illiberal but rather wicked,
        unjust, and impious against God, as if they were criminals. Men of this
        caliber are not so designated even though they take when they ought not
        and what they ought not, for example, usurpers who despoil cities and
        temples.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        704. Next [3, b], at “Among the illiberal,” he mentions those who take
        unjustly, like the gambler who makes money by throwing dice, the fellow
        who steals from the dead (formerly buried in rich apparel), and the
        robber who plunders the living. All these are enriched by shameful
        means, inasmuch as, for the sake of gain, they engage in certain
        occupations considered disgraceful. This agrees with what was said about
        those persons just mentioned (703). But in these there is a special
        reason for turpitude. Some, for example, the despoiler of the dead and
        the robber expose themselves to great danger in doing things punishable
        by law. Others, namely, gamblers want to take something from their
        friends with whom they play, although it is more appropriate to
        liberality to give something to friends. It is obvious then that both
        types, by wanting to enrich themselves from improper sources, are makers
        of shameful profits. It is necessary, therefore, to say that all the
        previously mentioned taking or accepting is opposed to liberality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        705. Then [C’], at “Appropriately then,” he explains illiberality by
        comparison with the opposite vice, saying that illiberality is fittingly
        named from the contrast with liberality. It always happens that the
        worse vice is more opposed to the virtue. But illiberality is worse than
        extravagance, as was shown before (686-690). Consequently, it remains
        that illiberality is more opposed to liberality. The second reason is
        that men commit graver sins by the vice of illiberality than by the vice
        of extravagance. Therefore, illiberality gets its name from the
        privation of liberality because liberality is frequently destroyed by
        this vice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        706. Lastly, he sums up what has been said, stating that so far we have
        discussed liberality and the opposite vices.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        707. After the Philosopher has finished the study of liberality, he now
        begins to consider magnificence, the treatment of which he divides into
        two parts. In the first part [I] he treats the matter of magnificence
        and the opposite vices. In the second [II] he explains in what manner
        magnificence and the opposite vices operate in their respective matter,
        at “A munificent person is like a wise man etc.” On the first point he
        does two things. First [I, A] he shows what the matter of magnificence
        is; and second [I, B] what the vices opposed to it are, at “In this
        matter etc.” To clarify the first division he does three things. First
        [I, A, A’] he proposes the matter common to magnificence and liberality.
        Next [I, A, B’] he explains the difference between the two, at “Unlike
        liberality etc.” Last [I, A, C] he proves his proposition, at “The man,
        however etc.” He says first it seems appropriate that the treatise on
        magnificence should follow that on liberality. The reason is that
        magnificence, like liberality, is apparently a virtue concerned with
        wealth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        708. Then [1, A, B’], at “Unlike liberality,” he explains the difference
        between the matter of magnificence and liberality. He explains this
        point in a twofold manner. First [1, A, B’, 1] he proposes the
        difference. Next [1, A, B’, 2] he makes clear what he said, at “But
        magnitude etc.” Regarding the first he mentions two differences. The
        first is that liberality refers to all transactions concerned with
        money, viz., expenditures, receipts and donations. But magnificence
        refers only to disbursements or expenditures. The second difference is
        that in disbursements or expenditures magnificence exceeds liberality in
        the magnitude of the amount expended. Magnificence deals only in
        princely outlays, as the name implies, while liberality can be concerned
        also with moderate or excessive expenditures. Although magnitude
        indicates a kind of excess, we are not to understand that the munificent
        person spends on such a grand scale that he exceeds the bounds of
        reason, but his expenditures are made in amounts that are also in
        keeping with what is becoming. It is in keeping with both the one who
        spends and the projects on which the money is spent, as will be pointed
        out later (721-724).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        709. Next [I, A, B, 2], at “But magnitude,” he explains what he said,
        i.e., the manner in which the greatness of the expense is becoming to a
        munificent person. Because the word “great” is predicated relatively, as
        stated in the <i>Categories</i> (Ch. 6, 5 b 15), it is said here that
        the greatness of the expenditure is judged in reference to something
        else, for instance, the thing for which the expenditures are made or the
        person spending. The reason is that not the same outlay is considered
        large for a triarch (a commander of galleys having three rows of oars
        and called a trireme) and for a leader of a solemn enterprise, i.e., the
        chief superintendent, like a master of a temple or a school. The
        expenditure must be suitable in comparison with the dispenser and the
        thing for which the money is spent. Likewise the purpose for which the
        thing is used must be taken into consideration. Thus if expenses are
        incurred for the building of a house, we must consider further for whom
        the house is intended, whether for a public official or a private
        person, because different expenditures are demanded for different
        purposes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        710. Then [I, A, C’], at “The man, however,” he proves his statement,
        i.e., that great expenditure pertains to magnificence. The reason is
        that one who spends small or even moderate sums in a proper manner is
        not called munificent, for instance, if he frequently makes many
        separate disbursements for trifling things, so that all his expenditures
        taken together would make as great an amount as that which the
        munificent man spends, nevertheless he would not be called munificent
        even though he disbursed these small sums promptly and generously.
        Because every munificent person is liberal, it does not follow that
        every liberal person is munificent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        711. At “In this matter” [I, B ] he shows what vices are contrary to
        magnificence. He says that the vice opposed to the habit of magnificence
        by defect is called meanness; but the vice by excess,
        <i>banausia</i> (ostentation) from baunos meaning furnace,’ because such
        as have the vice consume all their goods as in a furnace. If other terms
        of this kind exist, they come under the name <i>apirocalia</i> (lack of
        taste): offenders being, as it were, without experience of what is
        suitable because they do not know how to do the proper thing. Such names
        signify excess not because they surpass the munificent person in the
        amount of disbursements on the right projects, but they are excessive in
        going beyond right reason, spending, with a certain display, great sums
        on the wrong things. It is obvious from this that the mean and the
        extremes in moral virtues are not taken according to absolute quantity
        but in relation to right reason. He adds that he will discuss these
        vices afterwards in this book (784-790).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        712. Next [II], at “A munificent person,” he explains in what manner
        magnificence and the opposite vices are concerned with the previously
        mentioned matter. First [II, A] he treats magnificence, and then [Lect.
        7 (II) B] the opposite vices, at “One who sins etc.” (B. 1123 a 19). On
        the initial point he does two things. First [II, A, A’] he assigns to
        the munificent man certain qualities pertaining to the manner of
        spending. Then [Lect. 6, (II, A), B’] he shows on what objects the
        munificent person makes expenditures, at “Magnificence belongs etc.” (B.
        1122 b 19). In regard to the first he attributes to the munificent
        person six qualities, the first (II, A, A’, 1] of which is that he is
        like a wise man. The reason is that, as it belongs to a wise craftsman
        to know the proportion of one thing to another, so also it belongs to
        the munificent man to know the proportion between expenditures and that
        for which the expenditures are made. In virtue of his habit the
        munificent man is able to judge what may be proper to spend. Thus he
        will make grand disbursements in a prudent way because prudent operation
        is required for every moral virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        713. The Philosopher clarifies the statement by what was said in the
        second book (322), that every habit is determined by operations and
        objects of which it is the habit, because determined habits have their
        own proper operations and objects. Since the operations of magnificence
        are expenditures, and the objects of the operations are the things for
        which the expenditures are made, it is therefore the duty of the
        munificent man to consider and expend large and handsome sums, which
        cannot be done without prudence. In this way the vast outlay will be in
        keeping with the operation, for instance, the construction of a house or
        something of this sort. So then the project on which the money is spent
        must be such that it is worthy of the cost or expense and this ought to
        be worthy of the work, or in excess of it. It is very difficult to
        attain the mean; hence if a departure from the mean should occur, virtue
        always inclines to what has less evil, as the brave man to less fear,
        the liberal man to giving and so the munificent man to more spending.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        714. He gives the second quality [II, A, A’, 2], at “Things of this
        kind,” which is understood on the part of the end. The munificent
        person, he says, consumes grand and proper amounts for an honorable good
        as for an end. Now, to work for a good is common to all the virtues.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        715. At “‘Furthermore” [II, A, A’, 3] he presents the third
        consideration, saying that it is characteristic of the munificent man to
        spend great sums cheerfully and with an open hand, dispensing them
        promptly and readily. The reason is that great caution in accounting or
        computing expenses pertains to illiberality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        716. He introduces the fourth quality at “He plans” [II, A, A’, 4],
        affirming that the munificent person plans how he may accomplish the
        best and most splendid work rather than how he can spend the least in
        doing the desired work.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        717. He enumerates the fifth quality, at “Likewise the munificent” [II,
        A, A’, 5] when he says that one who is munificent should be liberal. The
        reason is that the liberal person should make the right expenditures in
        the right manner. The munificent man, too, acts in this way, for he
        makes outlays for great and noble achievements, as was just said (708);
        and he does this cheerfully, generously, and for a good purpose. But it
        is characteristic of the munificent person to do something on a grand
        scale touching this matter. In fact magnificence is nothing other than a
        kind of magnified liberality concerning these things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        718. At “Besides, for the same cost” [II, A, A’, 6] he gives the sixth
        quality. He says that, although the munificent person incurs great
        expense for some noble work, he produces a more magnificent work with
        equal expenditure. This is so because excellence (what is ultimate and
        best) is not the same in possession of money and in a work for which
        money is spent. Excellence (what is greatest and best) in possessions is
        found in the most valued object, viz., gold, which men highly honor and
        prize. But excellence in a work is found in this that a work is great
        and good; for the contemplation of such a work gives rise to
        admiration-and this is what magnificence does. So it is evident that the
        “virtue” of a work, i.e., its greatest excellence corresponds to
        magnificence involving expenditures on a large scale.

        He will spend in a manner proper to each thing. The same expenditure is
        not appropriate to gods and men, nor in building a temple and a tomb. He
        will make an outlay for each thing according to the kind, being most
        munificent in spending a great amount on a great work. But the expense
        will be great in comparison with the things. What is great in regard to
        the work differs from what is great in cost considered in itself. A very
        pretty ball or jar takes on magnificence when presented as a gift to a
        child, although the price is trivial and not in the category of liberal.
        Hence the munificent person has the advantage of performing a great work
        in any category. And a work, great in its class and reasonable in its
        cost, can hardly be surpassed. This, then, is a description of the
        munificent person.

        One who sins by excess, i.e., the vulgarian, is immoderate in spending
        contrary to what he ought, as has been pointed out. He expends great
        sums on paltry things, and his lavishness is out of harmony,
        figuratively speaking. He banquets buffoons with dishes fit for a
        marriage feast, gives presents to comedians, and rolls out a red carpet
        for their entry like the Megarians. In all such affairs he does not act
        to attain the good but to show off his wealth, hoping in this way for
        admiration. Where grand outlays are called for, he spends little; where
        small expenditures are in order, he lays out much.

        spend as little as he can. Moreover, he does this glumly and is of the

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        719.After the Philosopher has shown in what manner the munificent person
        should be concerned with spending, he now [II, B’] shows the principal
        object on which the munificent person should spend money. He gives two
        explanations of this point. First [B’, 1] he explains for what things
        the munificent man should make expenditures; and next [B’, 2.], how he
        preserves proportion between the cost and the objects paid for, at “He
        will spend in a manner proper to each etc.” He manifests the initial
        point in a twofold manner. First [i, a] he sets forth the principal
        objects for which the munificent should spend money; and then [i, b],
        the secondary objects, at “or even in any private etc.” On this first
        point he does three things. First [a, i] he discloses what the principal
        objects are for which the munificent person disburses funds. Next [a,
        ii], he indicates who should make such expenditures, at “But in all
        these things etc.” Last [a, iii], he sums up his views, at “Such then,
        especially etc.” He says first that the munificent man lays out large
        amounts for things that are honorable in the highest degree. These sums
        are of two kinds. The first of them pertains to divine things (for
        example, the placing of votive offerings in the temples of the gods) and
        preparations (the building of the temple or some other things of this
        kind). Even sacrifices come under this heading. The gentiles, however,
        worshipped not only gods, i.e., certain separated substances, but also
        demons whom they held to be intermediaries between gods and men.
        Therefore, he adds that everything expended on the worship of any demon
        whatsoever belongs to this same classification. The Philosopher speaks
        here of a heathen custom that has been abrogated by the plain truth.
        Hence if someone now spent any money on the worship of a demon he would
        not be munificent but sacrilegious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        720. The second kind of honorable expenditures are those made for the
        common good in a sumptuous manner: a person nobly and lavishly gives a
        becoming donation of something useful to the community; a man, charged
        with an office by the state like the captaincy of a trireme (a fleet of
        ships or galleys), makes great expenditures in the execution of that
        office; or someone gives a banquet for the whole community according to
        a custom, as is said in the second book of the Politics (Ch. 9, 11271 a
        33; StTh. Lect. 14, 317).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        721. Next [a, ii], at “But in all these,” he shows for whom such
        expenditures are appropriate. Regarding this he does three things. First
        [ii, x] he explains for whom, in general, such expenditures are
        appropriate. Then [ii, y], at “For this reason the poor man,” he infers
        for whom, in particular, they are inappropriate. Finally [ii, z], at “A
        great expenditure etc.,” he shows for whom, in particular, they are
        appropriate. He says first that in all these things that are expended—as
        was just mentioned (712-713), we must have regard not only for the
        objects for which a Person spends money (so that we should consider
        whether the spender is a prince or a private person, a noble or a
        commoner) but also what possessions, large or small, he may have.
        Expenditures must be proper, i.e., well proportioned to the wealth and
        station of the person, so that the expenses may be suited not only to
        the work for which they are incurred but also to the spender.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        722. Then [ii, y], at “For this rcason,” he infers that such
        expenditures may not be appropriate. Because of what was just said, the
        poor man who has little wealth cannot be munificent, for he does not
        have so great an amount that he can rightly afford to spend much. If he
        attempts to spend more, he is foolish since it is contrary to good taste
        and beyond what is proper. So it does not pertain to the virtue of
        magnificence because, by means of virtue, all things are done correctly,
        i.e., properly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        723. Next [ii, z], at “A great expenditure,” he discloses who may make
        these expenditures fittingly, understanding this in regard to two
        things. First he takes it according to the amount of riches. He says
        that great expenditures should be made by men who are wealthy, i.e., who
        possess great riches, much of which can be expended becomingly. It makes
        no difference whether they possess this abundant wealth of themselves,
        i.e., by acquiring it through their own industry, or have it from their
        parents (whose heirs they are), or even from ‘any others through whom
        riches come to them, for example, when they become heirs of those
        outside the family.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        724. Second, he considers the proposition according to the condition of
        persons. It is becoming that great sums be disbursed by the highborn and
        the renowned, i.e., those established in honor and other similar things.
        Everything of this nature has about it a certain greatness and decorum,
        so that such splendid donations may be made appropriately.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        725. Then [a, iii], at “Such, then,” he sums up his views, affirming
        that the munificent person is of the sort described above, and that
        magnificence consists in expenditures of this kind—as was stated in
        719-720—viz., on things for divine worship and the public welfare, for
        such are the greatest and most honorable among all human goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        726. Next [i, b], at “or even,” he shows on what secondary objects the
        munificent person spends money. He mentions three kinds of objects, the
        first [b, i] of which consists in the munificent man spending great sums
        on affairs pertaining properly to himself and happening only once, like
        marriage, military service, and so on.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        72.7. He gives the second kind [b, ii], at “or in any event.” If the
        whole city or the rulers are anxious to do something and a man makes
        great expenditures on this he will be munificent, for instance, if he
        should honorably receive some guests such as princes or kings, if he
        should give them great banquets, or even personally offer presents to
        them, or if he should repay certain favors received; in all these
        situations, the munificent person will spend large sums. He is not
        lavish with himself so that he spends much for his own use, but he makes
        great expenditures for the common good. The splendid gifts bestowed on
        some resemble those given to God. The reason is that, as offerings are
        consecrated to God not because He needs them but out of reverence and
        honor, so also presents are made to distinguished men more on account of
        honor than any need.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        728. Then [b, iii], at “It is the privilege,” he mentions the third
        kind, stating that it pertains to magnificence to build a home in the
        proper manner with one’s own riches, for a decent home adds to a man’s
        distinction. And in constructing buildings the munificent man desires to
        spend money rather on lasting and permanent parts than on fragile
        decorations, for instance, on marble columns in the house rather than on
        glass windows. Things that are more permanent are best.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        729. Hence, it is clear from what has been said that the munificent man
        spends money principally on the things destined for divine worship and
        the public welfare, but secondarily on things pertaining to private
        persons under three conditions: first that the things happen once,
        second that in addition the common good is pursued, third that they are
        of a permanent nature. These are the requisites making for greatness in
        private matters.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        730. Next [B’, 2], at “He will spend,” he explains in what way the
        munificent person maintains the proportion Of costs appropriate to the
        things for which the expenditure is made, spending on each object what
        is fitting both in kind and quantity. It is obvious that not the same
        kind and quantity of outlay is suitably offered to gods and men, nor
        used in the construction of a temple and a tomb. He will see to it that
        he spends a sum large according to the kind of thing. Hence he will be
        very munificent when he makes a great expenditure on a great work. But
        in this work he will make what is great in this class. So, sometimes
        what is great in regard to the work differs from what is absolutely
        great in expense. From the fact that someone makes a very pretty globe,
        i.e., a ball, or a vase (a small vessel) as a gift to a boy, he is said
        to possess magnificence in the genus of children’s gifts, although the
        price of the beautiful globe in itself is small, not belonging to the
        class of generous donations. Obviously, therefore, the munificent person
        has the advantage of performing a great work in any genus, making
        expenditures commensurate with the merit of the work. A production of
        this sort, which is great according to its kind and reasonable in its
        cost, can hardly be surpassed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        731. Last, he succinctly states the conclusion that the munificent man
        is such as has been described.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        732. Then [(II) B], at “One who sins by excess,” he treats the opposite
        vices: first [B, A’], considering excess; next [B, B’] defect, at “But
        the petty person etc.”; and last [B, C’] what is common to both, at
        “These, then, are.” He says that the man who is immoderate in grand
        outlays—called <i>banausos</i> because he consumes his goods as in a
        furnace—exceeds the munificent person not in the absolute amount spent
        but in spending in a way contrary to what he should. The reason is that
        he uses much money in superfluous expenses, and wants to make lavish
        expenditures contrary to harmony, i.e., against the right
        proportion—which is said by way of metaphor—for instance, he entertains
        buffoons and comedians with nuptial banquets, contributes much to
        actors, even rolling out the red carpet for their entry, as the
        Megarians (certain Greek citizens) are in the habit of doing. He does
        all these and similar things not for some good but for making a show of
        his riches, thinking that he will be admired for this reason. However,
        he does not always spend lavishly but sometimes he falls short. Where he
        ought to spend much, he spends little; but where little, much. The
        reason is that he does not keep his eye on the good but on vanity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        733. Next [B, B’], at “But the petty person,” he considers the vice of
        defect and states that the petty person falls short in everything,
        assigning him five traits. The first is that when the petty person does
        make great expenditures he fails to do well because of a trifle. The
        second, what sums he expends he expends tardily. The third, he always
        keeps his mind on how he may spend the least. The fourth, he is a gloomy
        spender. The fifth, when he lays out everything, he thinks he has done
        more than he should, for it seems to him that he ought to spend less.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        734. Then [B, C’], at “These, then,” he considers what is common to
        either vice. He comes to the conclusion that the two previously
        mentioned habits are certain vices because they are opposed to virtue by
        a departure from the mean. However, they are not opprobrious since they
        do not injure our neighbor in any way, and are not very disgraceful
        because it is difficult in disbursing large amounts not to depart from
        the mean.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        735. After the Philosopher has finished the treatise on the virtues
        concerning money, he treats here the virtues having to do with honors.
        First he considers magnanimity, which regards great honors [Lects. 8, 9,
        10, 11]; and then a nameless virtue concerned with ordinary honors
        [Lect. 12], at “As we remarked in the beginning etc.” (B. 1125 b). In
        the first consideration he does two things. First [I] he investigates
        the matter of magnanimity and the opposite vices; and second [Lect. 9;
        II] their acts and properties, at “For the most part etc.” (B. 1124 a
        4). On the first point he does two things. First [A] he sets forth his
        proposition; and next [B] he explains it, at “A person seems to be etc.”
        He says first: from its name, magnanimity apparently is concerned with
        great things. But at the beginning we must understand the nature of the
        things with which it deals. Then he designates the manner of
        consideration, viz., it does not matter whether we speak of the habit of
        magnanimity or of the man who is disposed by the habit, i.e., the
        magnanimous person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        736. Next [B], at “A person seems,” he explains his proposition by doing
        two things. First [A’] he exposes the matter of magnanimity generally;
        and then [B’] specifically, at “If a man etc.” On the first point he
        does two (three) things: First [A’, i] he shows that magnanimity refers
        to great things; and then [A’, 2], at “The person who judges etc.,” how
        the opposite vices occur in regard to the same matter. Last [A’, 3] he
        explains how the virtue consists in the mean, at “However, the
        magnanimous etc.” He treats the first point under three aspects. First
        [A’, i, a] he exposes his viewpoint, saying that a person seems to be
        magnanimous who thinks himself worthy of great things, viz., that he may
        perform great deeds and that great things should happen to him when in
        fact he is worthy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        737. Then [A’, i, b], at “But he who presumes,” he teaches that the
        magnanimous person must be worthy of great things. One who thinks
        himself worthy of great things contrary to truth, i.e., of which he is
        not really worthy, is foolish. It is characteristic of a wise man to
        keep everything in proper order. But the virtuous man is neither unwise
        nor foolish because virtue operates according to right reason, as was
        affirmed in the second book (257, 322, 335). Consequently, it is clcar
        that the magnanimous man is the person just described, i.e., one worthy
        of great things who thinks himself worthy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        738. Finally [A’, i, c], at “He whois worthy,” he shows that the
        magnanimous man should think himself worthy of great things. One who is
        worthy of small things and considers himself so, can be called temperate
        in the sense that temperance is taken for any moderation whatsoever.
        However, he cannot be called magnanimous because magnanimity consists in
        a certain size, just as beauty properly consists in a good build. Hence
        those who are short can be called fair by reason of complexion or
        well-proportioned members but not handsome because they lack size.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        739. Next [A’, 2], at “The person who judges” he shows in what manner
        the opposite vices should be concerned with great things, first [A’, 2,
        a] regarding the vice of excess; and then [A’, 2, b] the vice of defect,
        at “on the other hand etc.” Aristotle says first that the man who thinks
        himself worthy of great things when he is really unworthy is called
        conceited, i.e., puffed up-we can call him inflated or presumptuous. But
        the person who is really worthy of great things and thinks himself
        worthy of still greater things is not always called conceited, because
        it is difficult to find an exact norm so that someone may judge himself
        not worthy of great things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        740. Then [A’, 2, b], at “On the other hand,” he explains how the vice
        of defect is concerned with great things, saying that the man who thinks
        himself worthy of lesser things than he is worthy is called
        pusillanimous. This is so, whether in fact he is worthy of great,
        mediocre, or small things. However, the small-souled person is one who
        refuses to strive after great accomplishments and aims at certain petty
        undertakings when he is truly capable of what is great. Hc would bring
        himself down to affairs more trifling still, except for the fact that he
        is capable of great things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        741. Next [A’, 3], at “However, the magnanimous man,” he shows how
        magnanimity is in the mean, for, treating as it does of great things,
        magnanimity seems to consist in the extreme. Since the average is the
        mean between the large and the small, the great has the nature of an
        extreme. Hence he says that the magnanimous person holds an extreme in
        reference to great things of which he deems himself worthy. But he holds
        the mean inasmuch as he does this in an appropriate manner in
        considering himself deserving according to his worth. The mean of virtue
        is not Judged according to the quantity of the thing but according to
        right reason. Hence a man is not placed outside the mean of virtue by a
        work no matter what its size, provided he does not depart from reason.
        But the opposite vices exceed and fall short of what should be.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        742. Then [B’], at “If a man deems,” he explains the matter of
        magnanimity specifically, taking up three points. He shows first [B’, 1]
        that magnanimity is concerned with honor; second [B’, 2] how the
        opposite vices should deal with this matter, at “The pusillanimous
        person etc.”; and third [B’, 3] in what manner magnanimity is related to
        other virtues at “But the magnanimous man etc.” He explains the first
        point in two ways. First he reasons that if the magnanimous man deems
        himself worthy of great things when he is worthy of them, consequently
        [B’, i, a] he should deem himself deserving of the greatest things when
        he is deserving of the greatest. He says further that magnanimity is
        concerned with one object in particular, for what is predicated by
        excellence is attributed to one. When someone is said to be worthy of
        certain things, the worthiness refers to external goods which come to a
        man as a reward. But that must be placed highest which is attributed to
        God, which is desired especially by those in eminent positions, and
        which is the reward of the most noble deeds. Such is honor, for honor is
        shown to God, is sought by the prominent and is the reward of virtuous
        action. Obviously then honor is the best of all external goods.
        Consequently, magnanimity should give the greatest consideration to
        honors and dishonors, inasmuch as the magnanimous person manages things
        of this kind in the proper manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        743. Second [B’, i, b], at “Even independent of reasoning,” he manifests
        his proposition by experience, saying that, even without discussion, it
        is clear that magnanimity has to do with honor for the most part because
        experience shows the magnanimous deem themselves worthy of honor but not
        above their deserts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        744. Next [B’, 2], at “The pusillanimous,” he explains in what manner
        the opposite vices should be concerned with the previously mentioned
        matter. He says that the small-souled person is deficient in regard to
        himself because he considers himself deserving of lesser things than he
        deserves, and also in regard to the worthiness of the magnanimous man
        because he considers himself deserving of lesser things than a
        magnanimous man deserves. But the conceited or presumptuous person is
        excessive in regard to himself because he makes himself greater than his
        worth, however, not in regard to the magnanimous man because he does not
        consider himself deserving of greater things than the magnanimous man
        deserves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        745. Then [B’, 3], at “But the magnanimous,” he compares magnanimity
        with other virtues: first [B’, 3, a] showing that magnanimity is related
        to the other virtues; and next [B’, 3, b] drawing certain conclusions
        from what has been said, at “Therefore it seems.” On the first point he
        does two things: he shows that magnanimity is related to the other
        virtues, first [i] by a general argument; and then [ii] by the things
        appearing in individual cases, at “To an observer etc.” Regarding the
        first he does two things. First [x] he explains what makes magnanimity a
        special virtue, at “What is great etc.”; and next [y] he rejects an
        error, at “It is never becoming etc.” Aristotle says first that when the
        magnanimous person deems himself worthy of the greatest goods and is
        really worthy of them, it follows that he is best. The. better man is
        always deserving of greater things, and consequently he who is deserving
        of the greatest must be best. Therefore, the magnanimous man must be
        truly good, otherwise he would not be deserving of the highest honors.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        746. Then [x], at “What is great,” he shows how magnanimity is a special
        virtue when it accompanies other virtues. He says that what is great in
        any virtue seems to pertain to magnanimity because one who does not
        perform a great act of virtue is not worthy of great honor. So, when
        that virtue strives for what is proper to itself, it performs an act of
        another virtue, for example, fortitude intends a courageous action,
        magnanimity strives for a great deed in the courageous action. Since
        moral acts take their species from the end to which they tend, it is
        clear that magnanimity and fortitude differ in species (although they
        operate in the same matter) because neither virtue follows the same
        motive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        747. Next [y], at “It is never becoming,” he rejects an error. Some seem
        to think that the magnanimous man should rely upon his own opinion and
        follow the advice of no one. Likewise, that he should not hesitate to do
        injustice to anyone. The Philosopher, however, says this is false
        because no one does a shameful deed except for the desire of something.
        But the magnanimous person does not place so great a value on any
        external thing that he would wish to do a shameful action for it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        748. Then [ii], at “To the observer” he explains the clause: “of what
        happens in individual cases.” He says that to someone willing to observe
        individual cases, that man will seem altogether ridiculous who judges
        himself magnanimous without being virtuous. The reason is that if a man
        is evil he is not deserving of honor, for honor is the reward of virtue.
        Hence the magnanimous man thinks himself worthy of great honors.
        Consequently, no evil person is able to be magnanimous.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        749. Last [B’, 3, b], at “Therefore it seems’ “ he draws two conclusions
        from the premises. The first is that magnanimity seems to be an ornament
        of all the virtues because they are made more excellent by magnanimity,
        which seeks to perform a great work in all the virtues. In this way the
        virtues increase. Likewise, magnanimity accompanies the other virtues
        and so seems to be added to them as their ornament. The second
        conclusion is that it is difficult to be magnanimous because magnanimity
        cannot exist without the goodness of virtue, and even without great
        virtue to which honor is due. But it is difficult to attain this.
        Consequently, it is difficult for a man to be magnanimous.

        Moreover, he will observe moderation about wealth, power, good fortune,
        and adversity, no matter what may happen. He will not be exalted by
        prosperity nor cast down by misfortune, nor does he even regard honor as
        if it were a very great thing. Power and wealth should be desirable for

        The goods of fortune seem to contribute something to magnanimity, for
        the noble, the powerful, and the rich are thought to be worthy of honor
        as possessing goods of great excellence. But anything that excels in
        goodness is held in greater honor. For this reason such things make men
        more magnanimous, since they are honored by some people, but in fact the
        good or virtuous man alone is to be honored. However, he who possesses
        both (virtue and goods of fortune) becomes more worthy of honor.

        Men who possess goods of this kind without virtue are not justified in
        thinking themselves worthy of great things, nor are they rightly called
        magnanimous, for this supposes perfect virtue. But those having such
        things become evil by disdaining and harming others, since it is not
        easy to bear the goods of fortune with moderation. They are not able to
        endure good b fortune gracefully, but thinking themselves more
        excellent, they look down on others, and do as they please. Although not
        similar to the magnanimous man, they imitate him in the way they can,
        not by acting according to virtue, but in disdaining others. The
        magnanimous person justly disdains and properly glorifies others but
        many do not always act in this manner.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        750. After the Philosopher has investigate&amp;-the matter of
        magnanimity and the opposite vices, he now [II] studies their acts and
        properties, first [A] as touching magnanimity; and then [Lect. 11; B]
        the opposite vices, at “But the man who fails etc.” (B. 1125 a 16). On
        the initial point he does two things. First [A’] he shows how the
        magnanimous person should work on matter proper to him. Next [Lect. 10;
        B’] he defines the traits of the magnanimous person, at “The magnanimous
        man does not run risks foolishly etc.” (B. 1124 b 6). He explains the
        first point by a twofold procedure. Initially [1] he shows how the
        magnammous man should conduct himself toward honors, the matter of
        magnanimity; and then [2] toward other things, at “Moreover, he will
        etc.” He treats the first in two ways. First [1, a] he resumes the
        previous discussion (735-749) about the matter of magnanimity,
        reaffirming what was clear from the premises, that someone is called
        magnanimous especially and principally from the fact that he conducts
        himself well in regard to honors and the opposites, viz., dishonors. The
        same virtue is concerned with opposites; fortitude, for instance, deals
        with fear and rashness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        751. Then [1, b], at “He takes moderate delight,” he shows how the
        magnanimous man deals with matter of this kind. First [1, b, i] he shows
        the nature and mode of this man’s reaction to great honors, saying that
        great and desirable honors bestowed on the magnanimous for virtuous
        activity are a source of moderate delight to them. A man might take
        inordinate pleasure in goods acquired because they come to him
        unexpectedly, and value them far above their worth. But when the
        magnanimous person acquires things, he looks upon them as goods
        peculiarly suitable to him and, besides, less than his due. He judges
        that no honor outwardly shown to men is a sufficient reward of virtue.
        The reason is that the good of reason, for which virtue is praised,
        exceeds all external goods. Nevertheless, he is not displeased because
        lesser honors are bestowed on him than he deserves. But he accepts them
        with equanimity considering that men have nothing better to give him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        752. [1, b, ii], at “Honors given him,” he sets forth the way in which
        the magnanimous person should regard trifling honors. If honors are
        given him by transitory things and for any other reason than virtue (for
        example, if he is extolled for riches or the like, or by some
        insignificant honors), he will despise such honors because he considers
        himself undeserving of this type of thing. It is not enough for the
        virtuous to be honored like the rich.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        753. Last [1, b, iii], at “He likewise counts,” he explains in what
        manner the magnanimous man should deal with dishonor, saying that here
        also he shows moderation. As his mind is not exalted by great honors, so
        it is not cast down by insults which he considers imputed to him
        unjustly. Hence it is obvious that the magnanimous person is especially
        praised in regard to honors.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        754. Then [2], at “Moreover, he will observe,” he shows in what way the
        magnanimous person should deal with secondary matters, for example,
        riches and so forth. On this point he does two things. First [2, a] he
        explains how the magnanimous man should act in regard to such objects;
        and next [2, b] how the objects benefit magnanimity, at “The goods of
        fortune etc.” He says first that, although the magnanimous person is
        concerned with honors principally, nevertheless secondarily he has to do
        with riches, power, and everything belonging to good fortune, inasmuch
        as someone is honored for these reasons. Likewise he will show
        moderation about such things and about misfortune, whatever may be the
        turn of events, so that he will not rejoice exceedingly in prosperity
        nor grieve unduly in adversity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        755. He proves the point by the argument given before (741-742) that the
        magnanimous man conducts himself with moderation in regard to honors
        that are the greatest of all external goods. This is clear from the fact
        that both power and riches are desired for the sake of honor according
        as men who have such things want to be honored for them. If then the
        magnanimous person thinks honor itself of little account so that he does
        not rejoice in it exceedingly, for a greater reason he will judge the
        other things of small moment, so that he will not rejoice in them
        immoderately. As a consequence, some judge the magnanimous to be
        disdainful because they despise external goods and value only the
        internal goods of virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        756. Next [2, b], at “The goods of fortune,” he shows how external goods
        of fortune do confer something on magnanimity. He explains first [2, b,
        i] that they increase it when accompanying virtue; and second [2, b, ii]
        that without virtue they cannot make a man magnanimous, at “Men who
        possess.” He says that all external goods of fortune seem to add
        something to magnanimity inasmuch as, for these very things, some are
        judged worthy of honor, viz., the noble, the powerful, and the rich. All
        such goods consist of a certain great excellence, just as the noble
        surpass the baseborn in excellence, and so on. Everything that is
        surpassing in goodness is honorable in a high degree, for honor is a
        kind of reverence due to a very excellent good. Since the magnanimous
        person is worthy of honor, such goods consequently make men more
        magnanimous accordingly as they are honored by some people who recognize
        only these goods. But really only the good or virtuous man should be
        honored because honor is the proper reward for virtue. If someone should
        possess both at the same time, viz., virtue and the goods of fortune, he
        will become worthier of honor inasmuch as each matter is honorable.
        According to truth and opinion, even the goods of fortune are a help to
        virtuous operations after the manner of instruments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        757. Then [2, b, ii], at “Men who possess’ “ he establishes that goods
        of fortune without virtue cannot make a man magnanimous. He says that
        those who have goods of this kind without virtue cannot rightly esteem
        themselves deserving of great honors. Hence they are not correctly
        called magnanimous because it cannot happen that a man deserves great
        things and is magnanimous without perfect virtue, as was pointed out
        before (749). But because of the excellence of external goods men who
        lack virtue look down on others, do them injury, and fall into similar
        evils, since without virtue it is not easy for someone reasonably to
        bear the goods of fortune. To conduct oneself with moderation among the
        goods of fortune is a great work of virtue. Those who lack virtue cannot
        bear good fortune gracefully. Consequently, thinking themselves better
        absolutely, they despise those whom they exceed in riches. Since they do
        not consider that any excellence is acquired by virtue, they take no
        pains to do anything good but do whatever comes to mind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        758. They want to imitate the magnanimous person when in fact they are
        not like him. They imitate him in the way they can, not I grant in
        operating according to virtue—a thing the magnanimous man does
        especially—but in despising others although, not in the same way as he
        does. The magnanimous person justly despises the wicked, and properly
        glorifies the virtuous. But many, who are without virtue, manifest
        disdain and honor indiscriminately, i.e., sometimes despise the virtuous
        and honor the wicked.

        But the movements of the magnanimous man seem deliberate, his voice
        solemn and his speech measured. He is not hasty since he is concerned

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        759. After the Philosopher has explained how the magnanimous man should
        work on proper matter, he here [B’] considers the traits of the
        magnanimous person. First [1] he proposes the traits that are taken by
        comparison with matters of the virtues; and then[2] those according to
        the inclination of the magnanimous man himself, at “Nor is he given to
        admiration etc.” On the initial point he proceeds in a twofold manner.
        First [1, a] he sets forth the traits of the magnanimous person, which
        are understood in comparison with externally connected things; and next
        [1, b] in comparison with human acts, at “Leisure and slowness etc.” In
        regard to the first he makes a triple enumeration. He enumerates the
        traits of the magnanimous person first [1, a, i] by a comparison with
        external dangers that are the matter of fortitude; then [1, a, ii] by a
        comparison with external benefits that properly pertain to liberality,
        at “He is good at helping others etc.”; and last [1, a, iii] by a
        comparison with honors that properly pertain to magnanimity, at “He acts
        with great dignity etc.” He passes over the matter of temperance, which
        does not have any greatness of itself but deals with material common to
        man and brute, as was stated in the third book (612). Nevertheless
        magnanimity tends to do what is great in all the virtues-this was
        pointed out before (746, 749).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        760. Touching on the first point he sets forth two traits, the first [1,
        a, 1, x] of which is that the magnanimous man is not
        <i>microkindinos</i>, does not expose himself to dangers for trifles,
        nor is he <i>philokindinos</i>, i.e., a lover of danger, as it were
        exposing himself to dangers hastily and lightly. This is so because no
        one lays himself open to danger except for something having considerable
        value. But it is characteristic of the magnanimous man that he values
        few things to such a degree that he is willing to expose himself to
        dangers for them. Hence he does not undergo danger readily nor for
        insignificant things. However, the magnanimous man is
        <i>megalokindinos</i>, i.e., braves great dangers for great things
        because he puts himself in all kinds of danger for great things, for
        instance, the common welfare, justice, divine worship, and so forth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        761. He assigns the second trait [1, a, i, y] at “When in danger.” He
        affirms that the magnanimous person in exposing himself to danger acts
        ardently, so that he does not spare his own life, as if it were
        unfitting for him to prefer to live rather than gain great good by his
        death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        762. Next [1, a, ii], at “He is good,” he enumerates five traits of the
        magnanimous man, which are understood by comparison with benefits proper
        to liberality. The first [1, a, ii, v] is that the magnanimous person is
        proficient at doing good for others, i.e., prompt to bestow benefits,
        but is ashamed to accept favors from others. To receive favors pertains
        to one who has lesser gifts, while the magnanimous man tries to surpass
        others in virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        763. At “He makes lavish recompense,” he indicates the second trait [1,
        a, ii, w], saying that if the magnanimous person does accept benefits he
        is anxious to return greater ones. In this way the man who bestowed
        benefits in the beginning will rather receive them, i.e., becomes the
        recipient of benefits inasmuch as he receives more than he gave.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        764. At “The magnanimous person likes to remember,” he gives the third
        trait [1, a, ii, x], which does not follow the choice but the
        disposition of the magnanimous man-he is so disposed that he cheerfully
        confers but unwillingly receives benefits. We think often about the
        things that delight us and consequently remember them. However, we
        rarely think of things which displease us and consequently hardly ever
        recall them. Accordingly it seems characteristic of the magnanimous
        person to remember those for whom he does favors but not those who do
        favors for him, since this is contrary to his desire of wanting to excel
        in goodness. That man who is properly receptive, i.e., accepts favors,
        is less noble than he who grants favors. The magnanimous man does not
        choose to be unmindful of favors received but is anxious to bestow
        greater favors, as was just said (763).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        765. At “Likewise,” he places the fourth trait [1, a, ii, y ], saying
        that the magnanimous person cheerfully listens to the benefits he has
        bestowed but does not enjoy hearing of the benefits he has accepted. He
        can take delight in the love of him on whom he has conferred benefits
        but does not find pleasure in the fact that he himself has accepted
        benefits. He gives two examples of this. The first is taken from the
        writings of Homer who represents Thetis (called the goddess of water)
        approaching Jove (called the king of all the gods). She does not recount
        the benefits she herself has conferred on Jove, as if this would not be
        acceptable to him, but rather the benefits she has received from Jove.
        To this Jupiter listened more willingly. The other example is taken from
        Greek history in which it is narrated that certain Spartans, when
        seeking the help of the Athenians, did not recite the favors they had
        done for the Athenians but the favors received from them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        766. He assigns the fifth trait [1, a, ii, z], at “The magnanimous
        person likes to show,” saying that it pertains to the magnanimous man
        not to show himself in need of anything at all or at least not readily,
        inasmuch as he does not ask for or take anything, but to be prompt to
        minister to the needs of others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        767. Then [1, a, iii], at “He acts with great dignity,” he indicates a
        trait of the magnanimous person by a comparison with honors. He treats
        the first point in a threefold manner. First [1, a, iii, x] he names the
        trait, saying that it belongs to the magnanimous man to show himself
        noble and honorable to men of dignity and wealth, but to display a
        certain moderation with the middle class, not using a grand manner
        toward them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        768. Second [1, a, iii, y ], at “To attain excellence,” he offers two
        reasons for what he said. The first is that every virtue strives for
        what is difficult and honorable. That someone should excel great men in
        virtue is difficult and worthy of honor, but to excel mediocre men is
        easy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        769. The second reason is that it is characteristic of a manly soul to
        show himself worthy of respect among the great. But to wish respect
        shown him by men of lowly rank is the attitude of a man who is a
        nuisance to others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        770. Finally [1, a, iii, z], at “for instance,” he gives an
        illustration, stating that such a condition indicates lack of virtue,
        namely, that a man demonstrates his strength against the weak, and does
        not undertake difficult and honorable ventures in which others excel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        771. Next [1, b], at “Leisure and slowness” he distinguishes the traits
        of the magnanimous person by means of human acts pertaining first [1, b,
        i] to himself; and then [1, b, ii ] to others, at “Of necessity etc.”
        Aristotle says first that the magnanimous man is disposed to be
        leisurely, i.e., does not engage in many undertakings, and is
        disinclined, i.e., not readily occupied with business. He devotes
        himself only to those activities that are connected with some great
        honor or the accomplishment of some great work. Therefore, the
        magnanimous person performs at least some great operations that are
        worthy of the name.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        772. Then [1, b, ii], at “Of necessity,” he indicates the traits of the
        magnanimous person concerned with human acts that are related to
        another, first [1, b, ii, x] in regard to truth; and next [i, b, ii, y]
        in regard to pleasantness, at “He cannot conform.” These things are
        required especially for social intercourse with others, as will be
        explained later (816-849). To the first he ascribes four traits, the
        first [aa] of which regards internal inclination. The magnanimous man,
        he says, cannot make a secret of his friends and enemies. The reason is
        that a secret love or hatred of another arises from some fear, and fear
        is repugnant to a magnanimous person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        773. At “He cares more” [bb] he notes the second trait, saying that it
        is characteristic of the magnanimous man to be more solicitous about the
        truth than the opinion of man. He does not depart from what he ought to
        do according to virtue because of what men think.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        774. At “He speaks” [cc] he gives the third trait, saying that it is a
        mark of the magnanimous person to speak and work openly because he pays
        little attention to others. Consequently, he publicly divulges his words
        and deeds. That a man hides what he does and says arises from the fear
        of others. But no one fears those he condemns. Therefore, these two
        things are interchangeable, viz., that a man freely divulge things and
        that he cares little for others. However, we do not say that the
        magnanimous man cares little for others in the sense that he despises
        them—as it were depriving them of proper respect—but because he does not
        value them above their worth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        775. At “He is truthful” [dd] he assigns the fourth trait, saying that
        the magnanimous man does not speak falsehood but the truth, except
        perhaps that he playfully utters certain things in irony. However, he
        does use irony in the company of the common people.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        776. Next [1, b, ii, y], at “He cannot conform,” he indicates the trait
        concerned with pleasure that arises from companionship, saying that the
        magnanimous person does not easily associate with others; he finds
        company only with his friends. The servile soul has a tendency to occupy
        himself with the intimate affairs of everyone. Consequently all
        flatterers, who want to please everybody without distinction are
        obsequious, i.e., prepared to be subservient. People of low station who
        lack greatness of soul are flatterers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        777. Then [2], at “Nor is he given,” he enumerates the traits of the
        magnanimous man which arise from his natural bent. Aristotle first [2,
        a] gives some that exist in the soul; then [2, b] others existing in
        speech, at “Neither is he a gossip etc.” Last [2, c], he sets forth
        those traits that exist in communication with others, at “He is willing
        etc.” In regard to the first he places two traits, the first [2, a, i]
        of which is that the magnanimous person is not quick to show admiration
        because this is prompted by great things. But there is nothing great for
        him among the things that can happen externally, because his whole life
        is busy with internal goods, which are truly great.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        778. Next [2, a, ii], at “Nor is he mindful,” he says that the
        magnanimous person is not too mindful of the evils he has suffered,
        giving two reasons for this. The first is that the magnanimous man
        refuses to remember many things, just as he refuses to wonder at them.
        Another reason is that the magnanimous person deliberately determines to
        forget injuries he has suffered inasmuch as he despises the things by
        which he could not be disparaged. Hence Cicero said of Julius Caesar
        that he was in the habit of forgetting nothing but injuries.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        779. Then [2, b], at “Neither is he a gossip,” he gives two traits of
        the magnanimous man concerned with speech. First [2, b, i] he seldom
        speaks about men because he does not value highly their particular
        affairs. But his whole attention is taken up with the goods of the
        community and God. Consequently, he says little either about himself or
        others. He is not solicitous that lie be praised nor that others be
        blamed. Hence he does not have much praise for others nor does he speak
        evil of others, even his enemies, except to ward off an injury inflicted
        on him by them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        780. At “In necessary or trivial” [2, b, ii] he assigns a third (second)
        trait, that the magnanimous person neither complains by lamenting and
        grumbling about his lack of the necessities of life and other things,
        nor asks that they be given to him. This is the characteristic of one
        who is anxious about the necessities of life, as if they were great
        things, and this view is contrary to magnanimity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        781. Next [2, c], at “He is willing,” he indicates the traits that have
        a relation to external things, and first [2, c, i] in regard to external
        possessions. He says that the magnanimous man is more ready to own
        certain honorable and unfruitful goods which are profitless than goods
        which are profitable and useful. The reason is that a self-sufficient
        man has no need of profit from other quarters.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        782. Then [2, c, ii], at “But the movements,” he gives the trait of the
        magnanimous man referring to bodily movements, stating that his
        movements seem deliberate, his voice solemn, his speech measured and
        slow. Assigning the reason for these things, Aristotle says that the
        movements of the magnanimous person cannot be hasty since he is intent
        on few things. Likewise he is not contentious because he holds nothing
        external of value. Now, no one contends except for something of value.
        But sharpness of voice and hastiness of speech are resorted to be cause
        of contention. Therefore, the temperament of the magnanimous man
        obviously requires a solemn voice together with deliberate speech and
        movement. The Philosopher says in the <i>Categories</i> (Ch. 8, 9 b 12
        sq.) that if someone is naturally inclined to a passion, for example,
        bashfulness, he must have by nature that complexion which corresponds to
        bashfulness Hence if a man has a natural prone ness toward magnanimity,
        consequently he should have a natural disposition to qualities of this
        kind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        783. He concludes with the summary observation that the magnanimous man
        is just as we have described him.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        784. After the Philosopher has finished the treatise on magnanimity, he
        now [B] begins to treat the opposite vices. Here he does two (three)
        things. First [A’] he determines what is common to each vice. Then [B’]
        he considers each in itself, at “The small-souled person etc.” Last [C’]
        he compares the one vice with the other, at “But small-mindedness etc.”
        He says first that the man who falls short of the mean of magnanimity is
        called small-souled. But he who exceeds the mean is said to be
        conceited, i.e., puffed up-what we call inflated or presumptuous. These
        persons are not said to be evil to the extent of being criminals, for
        they injure no one and do nothing disgraceful. However, they do sin in
        this: they depart from the mean of reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        785. At “The small-souled person” [B’] he considers each vice: first [1]
        that which is according to defect; and next [2] that according to
        excess, at “Conceited people etc.” He discusses the first point in a
        threefold manner. First [i, a] he states the act proper to the
        small-souled man, saying that although such a man is worthy of good
        things, he deprives himself of those he deserves by not attempting to
        work or obtain things due to him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        786. Next [1, b], at “There seems,” he shows the cause of
        small-mindedness, pointing out that in this cause three things must be
        taken by turns. That a man deprive himself of goods he is deserving of
        happens first from the fact that he does not think himself worthy of
        such goods when in fact he is worthy. This occurs because he is ignorant
        of his ability. If the smallsouled man knew himself, he would strive for
        the things he deserves because they are good and desirable, since one’s
        own good is desirable to everyone. Ignorance of this kind does not come
        from stupidity-for the stupid are not worthy of great things -but rather
        from a certain laziness by reason of which they are unwilling to engage
        in great things according to their dignity. This is the third source
        from which the other two arise.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        787. Third [ 1, c], at “This opinion,” he explains the effect of
        small-mindedness. A person’s opinion that he is unworthy of the goods he
        really deserves appears to make him worse. Individual men strive for the
        things befitting their own worth. Hence when they are ignorant of their
        worth, they suffer a twofold damage to their goodness. First, they
        abandon works of virtue and the pursuit of speculative truths, as if
        they were unfitted for and unequal to things of this kind. From this
        omission of great and good works, they become worse, since it is such
        actions that make men more virtuous. Second, by reason of this opinion
        they shirk certain external good works of which they are capable and
        which instrumentally serve for the performance of virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        788. Then [2], at “Conceited people,” he discusses the vice of excess
        under two considerations. First [2, a], he gives the cause of this vice,
        saying that the conceited or presumptuous are both stupid and ignorant
        of their ability not because of laziness like the small-souled but
        because of stupidity. This is obvious because they attempt to do or
        attain certain honorable things utterly beyond their ability. So, when
        they fail in the action or accomplishment they manifestly appear to be
        discredited.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        789. Next [2, b], at “They adorn themselves,” he introduces the act of
        this vice, which consists in a kind of external glorification, inasmuch
        as the presumptuous greatly exalt themselves. First, they do this by
        certain external signs, that is, they wear elegant clothing and set off
        their figure by walking pompously. Likewise they do other things to show
        their excellence in the external goods of fortune. Second, they manifest
        things of this sort by words, as if wishing to achieve honor in this
        way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        790. At “But small-mindedness” [C’] he compares these two vices with one
        another, stating that small-mindedness is more opposed to magnanimity
        than conceit is. He assigns two reasons for this. The first reason,
        given in the second book (368), is that the vice, which occurs more
        frequently because of a stronger inclination of human nature toward it,
        is more opposed to virtue whose chief purpose is to restrain man’s
        inclination to evil. But some men are obviously more inclined to be
        small-souled (i.e., to omit the virtuous deeds possible to them) than to
        extend themselves in the performance of laudable feats beyond them.
        Hence small-mindedness is more opposed to virtue. The other reason is
        that small-mindedness is worse from the aspect of making men less
        virtuous, as was just stated (787). But what is worse is more opposed to
        virtue. Therefore, it is evident that small-mindedness is more opposed
        to virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        791. He summarily concludes that magnanimity is concerned with great
        honor, as has been pointed out (346, 742-744, 750, 754).

        As we remarked in the beginning, there appears to be a virtue that deals
        with honor and is compared to magnanimity as liberality is to
        magnificence. Neither of these virtues is in any way concerned with what
        is great, but both rightly dispose us in regard to mediocre and small
        things.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        792. After the Philosopher has concluded his study of magnanimity, which
        treats of honors on a grand scale, he now considers a certain unnamed
        virtue having to do with ordinary honors. To explain it he does three
        things. First [1] he points out i that such a virtue exists at times.
        Next [2] he proves his statement, at “Just as one can etc.” Last [3], he
        explains in what manner the mean and the extreme may be considered in
        this virtue, at “Since the mean lacks a name etc.” lie says first, as
        was stated in the second book (346-348), that there appears to be a
        virtue concerned with honor. That virtue seems to be related to
        magnanimity as liberality is to magnificence. Both these virtues, i.e.,
        liberality and the virtue under consideration, are separated from
        magnificence and magnanimity as from something great. The reason is that
        magnanimity deals with great honors and magnificence with great
        expenditures. But the two virtues, liberality and the virtue under
        consideration, dispose us in regard to small and mediocre things, either
        honors or riches.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        793. Then [2], at “Just as one can,” he proves his statement, first [2,
        a] by reasoning from similarity; and second [2, b] by the general manner
        of speaking, at “We blame the ambitious man etc.” He says that in taking
        and giving of small or ordinary sums of money there is a mean-and also
        an excess and defect-as was said before (679, 710-711). Likewise in the
        desire of small or mediocre honors, it happens that a man strives more
        or less than he ought, or for improper reasons inasmuch as one desires
        to be honored for more or greater things than he ought and another for
        fewer and lesser things. Likewise it happens that a man strives to be
        honored rightly in all things. So, clearly there is reason to hold for a
        mean of virtue and extremes of vice in small or mediocre honors as in
        smaller sums of money.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        794. Next [2, b], at “We blame the ambitious man,” he explains his
        proposition by an ordinary use of words. On this point he does two
        things. First [2, b, i] he indicates the ordinary manner of usage; and
        then [2, b, ii] he argues from this to the proposition, at “Clearly,
        inasmuch etc.” He says first that sometimes we blame the ambitious man,
        i.e., the lover of honor, for desiring honor more than he ought and from
        an improper source. Likewise, we blame at times the unambitious person
        for not wanting to do those good actions by reason of which he would be
        honored. On the other hand, we praise at times one who is a lover of
        honor as being manly or having a noble soul, and as a lover of the good,
        i.e., virtuous action to which honor is due. Again we praise
        occasionally a man who does not love honor—as it were regulating and
        ruling himself—so that he does not exceed his ability, as was stated in
        the second book (345-348).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        795. At “Clearly, inasmuch” [2, b, ii] he draws a conclusion from this
        manner of speaking, saying that at times we praise then again we blame
        the lover of honor. But it is obvious that one is called a lover of
        honor in various senses, and for this reason we do not praise and blame
        him for the same thing. But we praise the lover of honor according as he
        is more concerned than the general run of people for the things
        pertaining to honor. We blame him, however, inasmuch as he desires
        honors more than is proper. The same line of reasoning applies to one
        who does not love honor. Consequently, the mean in this matter is
        praiseworthy according as honor and desire for honor are valued at their
        true worth. However, the extremes are blameworthy insofar as one desires
        more than he ought or less than he ought.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        796. Next [3], at “Since the mean,” he treats the mean and the extreme
        of this virtue. On this point he does two things. First [3, a] he shows
        the uncertainty occurring here; and then [3, b] the consequences of that
        uncertainty, at “However, here the extremes etc.” He discusses the first
        point under three headings. First [3, a, i] he indicates the uncertainty
        with the observation that, since the mean concerned with desire for
        honor has no name-and so, because of this lack, appears as if passed
        over the extremes do not seem consequently to be clearly drawn, inasmuch
        as they are sometimes praised, sometimes blamed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        797. Then [3, a, ii], at “Now, where there is,” he explains what the
        truth is concerning mean and extremes. He says that whenever we find an
        excess and defect, there also we must find a mean. Therefore, since some
        strive for honor both more and less than they ought, it follows that
        some strive as they ought—which belongs to the notion of a true mean.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        798. Finally [3, a, iii ],at “Therefore, this unnamed habit etc.,” he
        shows the basis for this uncertainty. Because there is reason to accept
        a mean in regard to honors, the habit of the medium is praised.
        Likewise, because unnamed, it is designated by the names of extremes, as
        by a comparison with one of the extremes it seems to have a likeness to
        the other extreme. By comparison with excessive love of honor, the
        medium appears to have contempt of honor; but by comparison with
        contempt of honor, love of honor; by comparison with each it appears to
        be one as well as the other in some way. This is evident also in other
        virtues, for the brave man seems reckless by comparison with the timid
        man but timid by comparison with the reckless man. So, then, in our
        proposition the extremes considered in themselves are censured but as
        attributed to the mean they are praised.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        799. Then [3, b], at “However, here,” he explains how it follows from
        this uncertainty that the extremes seem opposed only to one another but
        not to the mean of virtue because the as well as the other in some way.
        This mean has no name.

        Meekness is a kind of moderation concerned with anger. The mean in the
        strict sense being without a name (and the extremes nearly so), we refer

        Anger is a passion arising from many and various causes. Hence a man who
        is angry over the right things, with the right persons, and moreover in
        the right way, at the right time, and for the right interval is praised.
        He is a meek man. But if meekness is an object of praise, the meek man
        seeks to be undisturbed and not controlled by passion, but to be angry
        at the things and for the length of time that reason directs.

        one acts rightly or makes a mistake. Persons, who transgress slightly,
        either in great or lesser things, are not blamed. In fact, sometimes we
        praise men as meek who are wanting in anger, and as manly and competent
        to rule who abound in anger. However, it is not readily ascertain able
        by reason to what extent and in what manner a transgressor is
        blameworthy, for judgment is to be made according to sense perception in
        individual cases.

        But it is evident in these matters that the mean habit is praiseworthy
        according to which we are angry with the right people, about the right
        things, in the right manner, and so on in other circumstances. Likewise,
        it is evident that excess and defect are blameworthy, in such a way
        however that if they are slight, they can be tolerated; if greater, then
        more blameworthy; and if very great, then very blameworthy. But
        obviously one must adhere to the mean habit. We have now discussed the
        habits concerned with anger.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        800. After the Philosopher has finished the consideration of the virtues
        dealing with external goods, riches, and honors, he now considers
        meekness, which deals with the external evils which provoke people to
        anger. On this point he does two things. First [I] he treats meekness
        and its opposed vices; and then [II] he answers an implied question, at
        “As was observed.” On the initial point he does two things. First [I, A]
        he shows how the mean and the extreme are discovered for anger; and then
        [I, B] he discusses them, at “Anger is a passion etc.” He says first
        that meekness is a certain mean for anger. However, in this matter the
        mean taken in the proper sense has received no name. The same can almost
        be said about the extremes because they are not distinguished by
        explicit names. The name meekness is taken to signify a mean, although
        the word implies a lack of anger. People are called meek because they
        are not violent, as it were like domesticated animals who lose their
        irascibility. Even the disordered lack of anger has not been given a
        name. Someone is said to be meek who is not angry for any reason
        whatsoever, either good or bad. However, the excess is called rage or
        irascibility.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        801. Then [I, B], at “Anger is a passion,” he first [A’] treats
        meekness; and then [B’], the opposite vices. He treats the first point
        from two aspects. Initially [A’, I] he explains what belongs to meekness
        as it is considered a virtue; and then [A’, 2] what belongs to it
        according to the real meaning of the word, at “However, he seems to sin
        etc.” He says first that irascibility is considered the vice of the
        extreme because it implies an excess of anger which is a passion arising
        from many and various causes. So, according to the diversity of these
        things, a mean and an extreme are found in anger. Consequently, the
        praiseworthy man is the one who is angry about the right things, at the
        right people, and in due moderation (since he is angry as he should be,
        when he should be, and as long as he should be). However, if the word
        meekness is used as a compliment, it would seem that the meek man is so
        disposed: first, that he is not disturbed internally in the judgment of
        reason by anger; second, he is not led by anger in external choice, for
        reason determines the objects of anger and the length of time within
        which anger should react.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        802. Next [A’, 2], at “However, he seems to sin,” he explains, in accord
        with the true meaning of the word, the character of the meek man who (he
        says) in this respect seems to err more in approaching the defect. When
        we call a person meek, we signify that he is not inclined to punish but
        to forgive and remit punishments. This is a thing belonging to a lack of
        anger which is a desire for vengeance achieved by punishment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        803. At “But the defect” [B’], he treats the opposite vices, taking up
        first [B’, i] the vices of defect; and then [B’, 2] those of excess, at
        “The excess etc.” Last [B’, 3], he compares these two vices with one
        another, at “Excess is more opposed etc.” He says that the defect of the
        mean in anger is censured whether we call it apathy or any other name
        whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        804. Since the Stoics were of the opinion that all anger is censurable,
        he consequently shows that the defect of anger sometimes is censurable
        for three reasons [B’, i, a]. He proposes the first reason at “a man
        seems to be foolish etc.” Whatever indicates, a lack of wisdom is
        blameworthy because virtue is praised for working in accord with the
        right understanding of prudence. But for a man to fail to be angry at
        the things, in the manner, at the time, and with the persons he should
        be angry seems to denote a lack of wisdom. It is evident that anger is
        caused by sadness. But sadness is a feeling of injury. If then someone
        fails to be angry at the things he should, he does not grieve for them
        and so does not feel they are evil. This pertains to a lack of wisdom.
        Therefore it is clear that a defect of anger is blameworthy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        805. He gives the second reason [B’, i, b] at “Moreover, he who does not
        get angry.” Anger is a desire for vengeance. Hence one who is not angry
        at the things he should, accordingly does not punish the actions he
        ought to punish. This is blameworthy. However, this explanation is not
        to be understood as if another vengeance cannot be taken according to
        the judgment of the reason without anger, but as if the movement of
        anger stirred up by the judgment of the reason makes one more prompt to
        take vengeance in the right way. If the sensitive appetite did not help
        to carry out the judgment of the reason, it would be useless in human
        nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        806. He introduces the third reason [B’, i, c] at “and it is
        considered,” saying only a cringing man suffers his household to be
        insulted and permits others to injure him without repelling the injury
        with due force. This follows from a defect of anger which renders a man
        slothful and remiss in warding off injury. Hence it is evident that the
        defect of anger is blameworthy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        807. Then [B’, 2], at “The excess can happen,” he treats the excess of
        anger. First [B’, 2, a] he shows that this vice takes place in many
        ways; and second [B’, 2, b] he considers its species, at “These persons
        are hot-tempered etc.” He says first that excess of anger can occur
        according to all the circumstances. It happens that someone is angry
        with the wrong people and in the wrong things, that he is provoked too
        much and too easily angered, that he is angry too long. However, all
        these excesses are not found in one man, both because of the trouble he
        himself would suffer from his own anger, and also because, being
        burdensome to all, he could not live with others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        808. This is universally true of evil -if it were complete, it would
        destroy itself. It could not continue to exist in taking away the
        subject by which it must be sustained if it is to continue to be. What
        does not exist can hardly be called evil, because evil is a privation of
        good. But every being precisely as existing is good. Obviously then evil
        does not take away good entirely, but some particular good of which evil
        is a privation. In such a way blindness takes away sight but does not
        destroy the animal. If the animal were destroyed, blindness would cease
        to exist. Manifestly, then, evil cannot be complete because in so taking
        away the good entirely, it would destroy itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        809. Next [B’, 2, b], at “Those persons,” he presents three kinds of
        excess in anger. The first [2, b, i] is that of those called
        hot-tempered, those easily aroused to wrath, readily becoming angry both
        with the wrong persons, and at the wrong things, and too vehemently.
        However, their anger does not last long but quickly subsides. This is
        very fortunate in a way for them that anger is not retained internally
        in their heart, but immediately bursts forth externally because they
        either take vengeance at the time or show their anger in some other way
        by clear indications with a burst of temper. In this way, when their
        anger is expressed they quiet down. So, also, heat which is shut up is
        kept at a higher degree, but when dispersed in vapor it disappears
        rather quickly. To this kind of anger the choleric seem disposed most
        readily by reason of the subtlety or speed of the bile. It is from this
        speed that excess is acquired by the irascible or <i>acrocholi</i>,
        i.e., those excessive in anger, from <i>acros</i> meaning extreme and
        <i>cholos</i> meaning anger, because they are intense and quick in
        anger.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        810. He presents the second kind (of anger) [2, b, ii], at “However, the
        sullen,” saying that some are called sullen whose anger is dispelled
        with difficulty and lasts a long time because they keep it pent up in
        their hearts. But they cease to be angry only when they have
        satisfaction for the injury inflicted. Punishment calms the surge of
        passion when the previous sadness is replaced by delight, inasmuch as a
        man takes pleasure in vengeance. But if this does not happen, that is,
        if punishment is not inflicted, they are sorely grieved inwardly, since
        they do not show their anger. No one can persuade them to moderate this
        wrath that is not indulged. But the dissolution of anger requires a long
        time in which the fire of wrath may cool off gradually and be
        extinguished. Such persons who retain anger for a long time are a trial
        to themselves and especially their friends with whom they cannot live
        pleasantly. For this reason they are called sullen. To this kind of
        excess, the melancholic seem particularly inclined because the influence
        received from the coarseness of the humor lasts a long time in them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        811. He introduces the third kind (of anger) [2, b, iii], at “We call
        those persons,” saying that some are called ill-tempered or morose who
        are angry at improper things, in an improper degree and for an improper
        length of time, and do not leave anger until they wreak vengeance on or
        punish those with whom they are angry. Indeed their anger lasts long not
        because of a retention alone that can be dissolved in time but because
        of a firm resolve to inflict punishment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        812. Then [B’, 3], at “Excess is more opposed,” he compares the things
        just treated with one another, stating that the excess of anger is more
        opposed to meekness than the defect is. He proves this by two arguments:
        first, it is the usual occurrence. Man is inclined more naturally to
        inflict punishment after suffering an injury to himself, while he is
        naturally inclined to meekness when he has not suffered any injury. The
        second reason is that the excessive in anger are more difficult to live
        with and to this extent are worse. Hence they are more in opposition to
        the good of virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        813. Next [II], at “As was observed,” he answers an implied question,
        namely, at what things and in what manner ought a man be angry. On this
        point he does two things. First [II, A] he affirms that this cannot be
        determined with certitude; and second [II, B] he states what is clear in
        this matter, at “But it is evident etc.” He says first that, as was
        observed in the second book (379) and there made clear, it is not easy
        to determine in what manner one should be angry, i.e., at things of what
        nature, for how long a time, and up to what point one acts correctly or
        errs in becoming angry. One who departs a little from the mean, either
        in great or small matters, is not blamed. In fact, at times we praise
        those who are somewhat deficient in anger and call them meek, but those
        who are a little excessive we call manly, as if able and qualified to
        rule by reason of their promptness for vengeance, which is appropriate
        to rulers. It is not easy to determine by reason the extent and kind of
        deviation from the mean for which a man should or should not be blamed.
        The reason is that judgment in this case depends on particulars and on
        sense perception which is more an interior than an exterior evaluation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        814. At “But it is evident” [II, B] he shows what is obvious in these
        matters, saying it is evident that the mean according to which we are
        angry with the right persons, at the right things, and so on with regard
        to the other circumstances, is praiseworthy. Likewise, it is evident
        that excess and defect are blameworthy, in such a way however that if
        they are slight they can be tolerated; if they are greater, they are
        more blameworthy; ana if very great, they are blameworthy in the highest
        degree. Hence a man ought to draw himself towards the mean.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        815. Last, he says in the epilogue that we have discussed the habits
        that deal with anger.

        However, since this virtue is with out passion or affection for people
        with whom we associate, it differs from friendship. A man does not take
        particular things as becoming because he is influenced by love or hatred
        but because he is disposed in this way. He will act similarly with
        strangers, intimates, and outsiders.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        816. After the Philosopher has considered virtues relating to external
        things, now he considers the virtues that relate to human actions. First
        [I] lie treats the serious; and then [Lect. 16, II] the humorous
        actions, at “Since recreation should have a place etc.” (B. 1127 b 33).
        In the investigation of the serious actions, he examines pleasantness
        and veracity. First [A] he investigates the virtue concerned with
        pleasantness and sadness arising from the serious actions of men; and
        then [Lect. 15, B] the virtue concerned with veracity, at “Likewise, the
        mean opposed to boasting etc.” (B. 1127 a 13). He develops the first
        point in a twofold fashion. Initially [A’] he shows that a mean and
        extremes are found in regard to pleasantness and sadness in human acts;
        and then [B’] he examines these, at “This mean habit has not etc.” He
        discusses the first from three aspects. First [A’, 1] he presents the
        vice pertaining to the excess of pleasantness. He says that in human
        conversation (by which men especially associate with one another
        according to a natural tendency) and generally in all human
        companionships (made possible by the fact that men communicate with one
        another in words and deeds) some seem to be obsequious, as it were
        straining to please men. Wherefore, they praise everything that others
        say and do for the purpose of making themselves agreeable. They never
        contradict people for fear of giving offense, thinking they must live
        without causing pain to anyone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        817. Second [A’, 2], at “Others, on the contrary,” he introduces the
        vice that pertains to the defect in such matters. He states that people
        who are cross-grained wish to be contrary to everything said or done as
        if trying to make others sad and taking care to emphasize anything that
        will make life unpleasant for others. These persons are called perverse
        or quarrelsome.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        818. Last [A’, 3], at “These habits’ he draws the conclusion that the
        mean is praiseworthy, saying that these habits, which consist in an
        extreme, are unworthy of praise. Obviously, then, the mean habit is
        worthy of praise—that habit by which a man accepts what others say or
        do, or rightly rejects and contradicts it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        819. Next [B’], at “This mean habit,” he defines the previous matter:
        first [B’, 1] the mean; and then [B’, 2] the extremes, at “Of those who
        are etc.” He handles the initial point in a twofold manner. First [B’,
        1, a] he treats the name of the mean habit; and then [B’, 1, b] its
        properties, at “Therefore, as has been pointed out.” He considers the
        name under three headings. First [a, i] he states that the mean habit
        has no name.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        820. Second [a, ii], at “But kt has he gives the habit a name from a
        resemblance to friendship. This virtue, he says, is very much like
        friendship because there is agreement in the external act which is
        especially proper to friendship, viz., to live amicably with friends.
        That person, who is disposed according to the mean habit of this virtue,
        conducts himself in agreeable association with others in a manner
        becoming to a friend whose friendship is moderated by reason-a thing
        that pertains to honorable friendship. Not every friendship is virtuous,
        as will be pointed out later (1574-1577). If the man who has this virtue
        should love those with whom he lives, his friendship will be entirely
        virtuous.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        821. Last [a, iii], at “However, since,” he shows how this virtue
        differs from friendship. He treats this point in a twofold manner. First
        [iii, x] he presents the difference; and then [iii, y] rejects a false
        understanding of it, at “Nevertheless, in particular cases etc.” He says
        first that, since this virtue is without love (which is a passion of the
        sensitive appetite) and without affection (which pertains to the
        intellective appetite) for those with whom we associate, it differs from
        true friendship. A man does not take the particular things said or done
        by others as becoming, because he is influenced by hatred or love of
        them but because he is disposed in this way by habit. This is proved by
        the fact that he observes the same not only with friends but generally
        with all acquaintances and strangers, intimates and outsiders.
        Liberality is like this. A friend gives gifts to his friends because he
        loves; the liberal man however gives not because he loves but because
        his nature is to be a free spender.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        822. Then [iii, y], at “Nevertheless,” he rejects a false understanding
        of these things. Since he just stated (821) that this virtue is
        practiced alike toward strangers and acquaintances, a man might consider
        this likeness as extending to everything. But the previously mentioned
        likeness must be taken as referring to this common characteristic, which
        is to live agreeably with others. There is a difference in regard to the
        special ways of living with others. The reason is that the virtue
        affects the proper actions in particular cases, for a person should not
        delight or displease intimates and outsiders in the same way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        823. At “Therefore, as has been” [B’, 1, b], he enumerates the five
        properties of this virtue; the first [b, i] of which is taken from the
        manner of communicating with others. As has been noted (821), one having
        this virtue always communicates with others in a becoming way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        824. At “Considering,” Aristotle gives the second property [b, ii],
        which is understood on the part of the end, saying that one having this
        virtue aims at living with others without offense or even with pleasure.
        This end pertains to a good that is honorable and advantageous, i.e.,
        useful, because it is concerned with pleasure and sadness occurring in
        associations in which human companionship principally and fittingly
        consists. This is proper to men in contrast to animals who share food
        and the like in common.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        825. At “Any virtuous man,” he introduces the third property [b, iii],
        which is understood by comparison with pain, saying that the man who
        possesses this virtue sometimes refuses to give pleasure to another, in
        fact sometimes chooses to cause pain. This may take place in two ways.
        In one way it can happen on his part: if a thing is not honorable to
        him, for instance, another uses indecent language; or if a thing is
        harmful to him, for instance, another injures him in word. In the other
        way, it can happen on the part of the person he lives with. This person
        may say or do something pertaining to his own great disgrace, or he may
        be greatly harmed. By reason of the fact that he is contradicted he is
        grieved to some extent. So the virtuous man will not take what is said
        by others, or if he does he will nonetheless reprove them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        826. At “He converses differently” he introduces the fourth property [b,
        iv], which is understood by comparison with different persons. He says
        that a virtuous man speaks and converses in a different way with persons
        in high places and with private persons, with friends and with
        acquaintances, and so on according to other distinctions of persons,
        ascribing to each individual what is appropriate.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        827. At “He primarily strives,” he presents the fifth property [b, v]
        which is taken by comparison of pleasure with pain. He affirms that the
        virtuous man primarily strives to give pleasure and declines to inflict
        pain. However, at times he causes some grief considering that future
        events will outweigh the existing affliction in what concerns decency
        and utility or even a future important consideration, the evidence for
        which is provided by the present distress. He concludes that the mean
        habit is like this but is without a name, although we can call it
        affability.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        828. Then [B’, 2], at “Of those who,” he defines the opposite vices,
        doing three things. First [B’, 2, a] he treats the vice belonging to the
        excess of pleasantness. He says that the man who is immoderate in being
        pleasant—if he does not act for something else—is called obsequious. But
        if he acts to acquire money or any other thing computable in money, he
        is called a sycophant or a flatterer.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        829. Next [B’, 2, b], at “But the individual,” he refers to the opposite
        vice, saying that the individual who is a trial to everyone is called
        contentious and perverse, as has been stated previously (817).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        830. Finally [B’, 2, c], at “However, the extremes, “ he compares the
        two vices one with the other, saying that the extremes seem to be
        opposed to one another but not to the virtue because the mean of the
        virtue is nameless.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        831. After the Philosopher has finished the treatise on the virtue
        possessing the mean in human actions in regard to amiability, he now [B]
        treats a virtue called veracity, which possesses a mean in the same
        human actions. First [A’] he explains his intention; and then [B’] he
        defines his proposition, at “The boaster simulates etc.” He develops the
        first point in three ways. First [A’, 1] he discloses that a certain
        virtue is a mean opposed to boasting. Next [A’, 2], at “It is not a loss
        etc.,” he shows that we must treat this virtue. Last [A’, 3], at “We
        have already discussed etc.,” he explains the difference between this
        and the preceding virtue. He says first that the mean opposed to
        boasting treats about nearly the same subject as the previous virtue.
        The reason is that it is concerned with human actions, but not in
        relation to the same thing, since it does not regard pleasantness but
        another topic to be discussed shortly (838). As in the case of the
        previous virtue, this mean too is nameless.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        832. Then [A’, 2], at “It is not a loss,” he explains why it is
        necessary to investigate this virtue, giving two reasons. First [A’, 2,
        a] he says that it is not profitless but in fact useful to moral science
        to treat the virtues as we go along. In this way we will learn better
        what pertains to morals if, as we proceed, we treat the material
        pertaining to individual habits. The reason is that the science of moral
        matters is completed by a knowledge of particulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        833. At “Observing what,” he presents the second reason [A’, 2, b]. We
        shall be assured that the virtues are kinds of median states by seeing
        how this is the case in the individual virtues.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        834. Next [A’, 3], at “We have already,” he defines the difference
        between this and the preceding virtue. He states that we have already
        considered (816-830) the people who in some way give pleasure or pain in
        their association and conversation with others. But we must still
        discuss those people who are truthful or deceitful in their words and
        actions or who simulate these qualities by their deeds.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        835. Then [B’], at “The boaster simulates,” he treats the virtues and
        vices. First [B’, 1] he presents the virtue and the opposite vices; and
        then [B’, 2], at “We will discuss both etc.,” he investigates them. He
        handles the first point from three aspects. First [B’, 1, a] he shows
        what belongs to the mean and extremes in this matter. Next [B’, 1, b],
        at “Each of these etc.,” he explains how the things which were discussed
        pertain to the median habit and the extremes. Third [B’, 1, c], at “A
        lie is intrinsically etc.,” he reveals that the mean habit is
        praiseworthy but the extremes, vicious. He says first that the boaster
        who sins by excess pretends certain praiseworthy qualities, and this in
        two ways. In one way he pretends to have some distinctions that he does
        not possess. In the other way, he claims distinctions greater than they
        really are. But the person who sins by defect is called a dissembler.
        However, the man who possesses the mean is said to be <i>autocastos</i>,
        i.e., admirable in himself, because he does not seek to be admired more
        than becomes him. He is also said to be <i>autophastos</i>, i.e.,
        essentially sincere, manifesting himself to be what he is. He is
        truthful inasmuch as the things he divulges about himself are true. He
        does this not only by word but also by his manner of living, according
        as his exterior conduct and his speech conform to his nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        836. At “Each of these” [B’, 1, b], he explains how these things pertain
        to the three specified habits, saying that each of the above-mentioned
        acts may happen in two ways. In one way, it may be done for the sake of
        something else, for instance, a man denies that he is what he is because
        of fear; in the other way, not for the sake of something else but
        because he takes delight in the act itself. This property belongs to a
        habit, since everyone speaks, acts and lives according to the quality of
        his habit. Of course at times he may act differently because something
        else arises.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        837. Then [B’, 1, c], at “A lie is intrinsically etc.,” he discloses
        what deserves praise and what blame in the habits mentioned, saying that
        a lie is essentially evil and to be avoided, but truth is good and to be
        praised. Signs were instituted to represent things as they are.
        Therefore, if a person represents a thing otherwise than it is by lying,
        he acts in an inordinate and vicious manner. But if he speaks the truth,
        he acts in an orderly and virtuous manner. Now, it is clear that the man
        who speaks the truth possesses the mean because he designates a thing as
        it is. The truth consists in an equality that is a mean between great
        and small. But the person who lies stands in an extreme either by excess
        because he affirms more than really is, or by defect because less than
        really is. Hence, it is evident that both are blameworthy. But the
        boaster who sins by excess deserves more blame since he departs farther
        from the truth; for the less, not the more, is found in the mean.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        838. Next [B’, 2], at “We will discuss both,” he investigates the
        previously mentioned habits, treating first [B’, 2, a] the virtue and
        then [B’, 2, b] the opposite vices, at “The person who boasts etc.” He
        treats the first point in a threefold manner. First [a, i] he determines
        what truthful person we are discussing. Next [a, ii], at “Such a man
        etc.,” he shows what is especially characteristic of this person. Third
        [a, iii], at “He turns aside etc.,” he explains to what extreme the
        person is more inclined. He says first that we must talk about these
        habits, but first about the truthful man. However, we do not have in
        mind now the person who speaks the truth in judicial testimony, for
        example, a witness who reveals the truth when questioned by a judge; nor
        the person who speaks the truth in any matter touching right—this
        pertains to another virtue, viz., justice. But we are directing our
        attention to that truthful man who manifests the truth in his life and
        conversation in matter not having distinction of justice and injustice.
        However, he manifests the truth only by reason of the disposition of the
        habit, as was said before about a previous virtue (821) that it aims at
        living pleasantly with others, not by reason of love but by reason of
        its habit. So, too, this virtue shows the truth not on account of the
        observance of justice but on account of the inclination it has to
        manifest the truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        839. At “Such a man” [a, ii], Aristotle explains what particularly
        pertains to the truthful man we have in mind, saying he is one who
        apparently observes moderation in his actions, avoiding excess and
        defect. He loves truthfulness and the truth even where damage or profit
        is of little importance. The reason is that he hates a lie as something
        shameful in itself, and not only because it injures another. A person of
        this kind is to be commended.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        840. Then [a, iii], at “He turns aside,” he explains to what extreme the
        truthful man more inclines, affirming that since sometimes it is quite
        difficult to tell the exact truth, he wishes to lean towards
        understatement rather than overstatement, This seems to pertain more to
        prudence since men tend to excess, and when speaking about themselves,
        they become tiresome to others. The reason for annoyance is that they
        seem in this to prefer themselves to others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        841. Next [B’, 2, b], at “The person who boasts,” he examines the
        opposite vices. He considers this point under three aspects. First [b,
        i] he investigates the vice pertaining to excess; next [b, ii] the vice
        pertaining to defect, at “Dissemblers, however etc.”; and last [b, iii]
        the opposition of vices among themselves, at “As being more vicious
        etc.” He treats the first point in a threefold manner. First [i, x] he
        shows in how many ways we may commit the vice of boasting which is an
        extreme by excess. Second [i, y], at “A boaster is constituted etc.,” he
        explains in what respect we may especially take into account the vice of
        boasting. Finally [i, z], at “Therefore, people who etc.,” he shows in
        what things we may principally commit the vice of boasting.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        842. He states first that sometimes a man says boastfully about himself
        things that are untrue or exaggerated, not for some other purpose but
        for the enjoyment he gets out of it. Such a man is said to have a
        semblance of evil, otherwise he would not find pleasure in lying, for
        this arises from a disordered soul. However, he is not at all evil since
        he does not intend any malice; he is only vain for taking pleasure in a
        thing which is really neither good nor useful. In another way, a person
        speaks boastfully about himself because he wants glory or honor. This
        person really ought not to be blamed since glory and honor have a
        certain relationship to honorable things for which people are praised
        and honored. in still another way, people brag about themselves for the
        sake of money or some other thing that can be valued in moncy. An
        individual belonging to this class is more vicious because he lies for
        an inferior good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        843. At “A boaster is constituted” [i, y], he explains in what respect
        we may take boasting into account, saying that a man is not considered a
        boaster from the fact that he has or has not the capability, but from
        the fact that he chooses to boast. He is called a boaster according to
        the habit that this choice follows. It is the same with any liar who is
        such in choosing to lie, or finding pleasure in lying, or lies out of
        his desire for fame or profit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        844. Then [i, z], at “Therefore, people who,” he explains the things
        that people usually boast about. Obviously, persons who find enjoyment
        in boasting boast indiscriminately. But those who boast for the sake of
        fame pretend things that seem worthy of praise, like virtuous works, or
        that have reference to good fortune, like the dignity of wealth and so
        on. Those, however, who boast for the sake of profit pretend things in
        which others find pleasure, otherwise it would profit them nothing.
        Again, when the things they boast about are not true, they take care
        that this fact can be hidden so their lie may not be discovered.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        845. He takes an example from two fields: first, from things belonging
        to medicine, since everyone wants health and no one can find out whether
        the doctor makes a mistake; second, from divination, which naturally
        disturbs men and where they cannot easily discover a lie. For this
        reason people who boast for profit especially pretend to be doctors or
        men wise in foretelling the future. Perhaps his use of the word “wise”
        can be referred to this that these men boast that they have a knowledge
        of divine things that is desirable and hidden.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        846. Next [b, ii], at “Dissemblers, however,” he considers the vice
        belonging to the defect. On this point he does two things. First [ii. x]
        he compares this vice with boasting; and then [ii, y] points out its
        difference at “Some people especially etc.” He says first that
        dissemblers who minimize the truth about themselves seem to have more
        pleasing ways than boasters, because they apparently do not speak this
        way for the sake of gain but as if fleeing from vanity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        847. At “Some people especially” [ii, y] he explains how this vice is
        practiced in different ways, saying there are some who especially deny
        about themselves things pertaining to great renown, for example,
        Socrates denied that he was wise. There are others who want to show by
        certain insignificant and obvious things that they do not pretend more
        excellent things about themselves than they possess. Such are called
        <i>blato-panurgi</i>, i.e., men who have their delight in a certain
        cunning pretense. <i>Panurgi</i> is a Greek word for “cunning fellow,”
        while <i>blaton</i> means something done amusingly. These, he says, are
        readily despised because their pretense is too obvious. A defect of this
        nature in external things sometimes seems to pertain to boasting when in
        this way they want to appear better and more observant of moderation,
        like the Spartans who wore clothing humbler than became their state. For
        this reason an excess and an immoderate deficiency in externals seem to
        pertain to boasting precisely because a certain singularity in a man is
        displayed in case of each.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        848. Still others exercise this vice in a mitigated form, since they
        neither altogether deny famous deeds done by themselves nor do they even
        attribute to themselves negligible qualities, practicing the vice in
        matter obvious and at hand. People like this seem to be pleasing, as was
        just said (846).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        849. Then [b, iii], at "As being more vicious," he considers the
        opposition between the vice and the virtue, saying that the boaster is
        more in opposition to the truthful man because more vicious, as we have
        already noted (837). The worse vice is always more opposed to virtue.

        The virtuous person will not employ every kind of jest, for some jokes
        are in fact an insult. But legislators forbid the making of some

        In human living there are three median courses, all of which regard
        communication in speech and action. They differ, however, for one deals
        with truthfulness and the others with what is pleasing. Of this second
        class, one concerns pleasure taken in amusements, the other concerns
        pleasure in things according to another aspect of life, viz.,
        conversations.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        850. After the Philosopher has finished the consideration of the virtues
        dealing with human actions of a serious nature, he now considers a
        certain virtue which deals with amusement [II]. He develops this point
        in three ways. First [A] he shows there can be it virtue and vice having
        to do with amusement. Next [B], at “People who engage in too much etc.,”
        he treats the virtue and the opposite vices concerned with amusement.
        Third [C], at “In human living there are etc.,” he explains the
        difference between this and those virtues already considered. In regard
        to the first we must consider that, as has been shown (329), there can
        be no corresponding virtue and vice concerned with what is intrinsically
        evil and incapable of having an aspect of good. Consequently, if no
        aspect of good can be found in amusement there will be no virtue
        connected with it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        851. But amusement does have an aspect of good inasmuch as it is useful
        for human living. As man sometimes needs to give his body rest from
        labors, so also he sometimes needs to rest his soul from mental strain
        that ensues from his application to serious affairs. This is done by
        amusement. For this reason Aristotle says that, since there should be
        some relaxation for man from the anxieties and cares of human living and
        social intercourse by means of amusement—thus amusement has the aspect
        of useful good—it follows that in amusement there can be a certain
        agreeable association of men with one another, so they may say and hear
        such things as are proper and in the proper way. Yet, in matters of this
        kind, talking and listening are very different, for a man properly
        listens to things he could not properly say. But wherever difference
        exists between the things that ought to be done and ought not to done,
        there is found not only a mean but also excess and defect in regard to
        this mean. Hence we have a virtuous mean and extremes concerned with
        amusement.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        852. At “People who engage” [B] he considers the mean and the extremes.
        First [A] he speaks about the nature of each habit; then [B’], at “Tact
        belongs etc.,” he shows what is proper to each habit. He discusses the
        first point in a threefold manner: initially [A’, 1] he explains what
        the mean and the extremes in amusement are; then [A’, 2] at “Actions of
        this kind etc.,” he shows that they belong to a difference of character;
        last [A’, 3], at “Since laughter is quite etc.,” he discloses that the
        extreme is sometimes taken for the mean. He treats this first point from
        three aspects. In the beginning [A’, 1, a] he shows what belongs to
        excess, saying that those who indulge excessively in playful derision
        are bomolochl or temple plunderers because of a resemblance to birds of
        prey who used to fly over the temple to pounce upon the entrails of
        sacrificed animals. In that way these people lie in wait so they can
        pounce upon something to turn into a laugh. On this account persons of
        this kind are a nuisance because they want to make laughter out of
        everything. They make more effort to do this than to engage in becoming
        or polite conversation and avoid disturbing the man they heap with
        playful reproach. They would rather tell scandalous stories, even at the
        risk of offending others, than (not) cause men to laugh.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        853. Second [A’, 1, b], at “On the other hand,” he explains the nature
        of the vice by defect, stating that men who never want to say anything
        funny and are disagreeable to the people who do (these being reasonably
        disturbed) seem to be uncultured or boorish and coarse, like those who
        are not mellowed by amusing recreation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        854. Third [A’, 1, c], at “But men indulging,” he explains the nature of
        the mean in amusement, saying that men who devote themselves to
        amusement in moderation are called witty (<i>eutrapeli</i>), as it were,
        good at turning because they becomingly give an amusing turn to what is
        said and done.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        855. Then [A’, 2], at “Actions of this kind,” he shows that the actions
        just mentioned belong to different habits. lie says that these movements
        by which a person wishes to amuse others too much, or too little, or in
        a moderate way are indications of internal dispositions of habit. As
        external movements of bodies clearly indicate their internal
        dispositions, so external actions manifest internal characters.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        856. At “Since laughter is quite” [A’, 3], he explains how the extreme
        sometimes is taken for the mean. He says that many people bubble over
        with laughter and take more pleasure than they should in jest and in
        joking reproach of others. Hence, they give the name witty to buffoons
        who please them by excessive indulgence in jest which the majority of
        men love immoderately. Nevertheless, as is clear from what was said
        before (852-854), buffoons are quite different from witty people.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        857. Next [B’] at “Tact belongs,” he shows what properly belongs to the
        preceding habits. First [B’, 1] he explains what is peculiar to the mean
        of the virtue; and then [B’, 2], at “However, the buffoon etc.,” what is
        proper to the extreme by excess. Finally [B’, 3], at “But the lout
        etc.,” he discloses what pertains to the extreme by defect. He handles
        the initial point from two aspects. First [B’, 1, a] he shows how the
        witty person conducts himself in general with reference to fun; and then
        [B’, 1, b], at “We must determine etc.,” how he acts especially in
        friendly banter. He considers this first in a threefold way. In the
        beginning [a, i] he brings out that the use of clean fun pertains to the
        mean habit. He affirms that what is characteristic of a tactful person
        (<i>epydexiotis</i>), i.e., of a man well-fitted and prepared to engage
        in conversation with others, belongs to the mean habit of this virtue.
        It is proper to men of this sort to narrate and listen to such amusing
        incidents as become a decent and liberal man who possesses a soul free
        from slavish passions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        858. Next [a, ii], at “Now, the witty person,” he gives a reason as
        proof for what he has said, viz., that wherever something is found that
        can be done in a becoming manner, there is a thing that belongs to
        virtue. But it happens that a witty person says and listens to what is
        becoming. This is obvious from the different kinds of jest. The jesting
        of the liberal man who spontaneously strives to act virtuously differs
        from the jesting of the servile man who is engaged in disreputable
        activities. The jesting of the cultured man who has been instructed how
        he should recreate differs from the jesting of the uncultured man who
        has not been trained by any instruction in jesting. Hence, it is clear
        that it pertains to the mean habit of virtue to speak and listen to what
        is becoming in jesting.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        859. Last [a, iii], at “Anyone can see,” he introduces a proof for the
        previous statement that the jesting of the cultured and the uncultured
        person differs. This, he says, is particularly evident in considering
        the conversation of the players with one another in the old and new
        comedies or plays. The evidence is that where these narratives in places
        contain obscene language, some create derision when they turn the
        obscene words into laughter; but others create a suspicion when they
        imply that those who were speaking in an obscene manner had evil in
        their hearts. However, obviously it is of great importance to human
        decency whether a man in playful conversation speaks obscenely or
        properly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        860. At “We must determine” [B’, 1, b], he explains how the virtuous man
        conducts himself regarding jesting insults. On this point Aristotle does
        three things. First [b, i] he asks the question whether we must decide
        that a person does well at raillery by reason of the things which he
        says, i.e., because he says what is becomingly said by a liberal man who
        is virtuous and decent; or that lie is not determined according to this
        but rather by reason of the end or effect, i.e., because he aims not to
        offend his listener; or, what is more, aims to give him pleasure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        861. Then [b, ii], at “This norm is indefinite,” he answers the second
        part of the question, saying that it is indeterminate what may offend or
        please the listener because different things are odious and pleasant to
        different people. Everyone will gladly listen to what pleases him. And,
        as long as no offense is intended, a man seems to promote those things
        which he patiently hears by co-operating in them with others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        862. Third [b, iii], at “The virtuous person,” he shows that something
        is settled as to the first part, viz., as to affronts that are offered.
        It is clear that the virtuous man does not make use of every reproach,
        since reproach is a kind of insult. Besides, legislators forbid the
        hurling of any insult that defames a man. They do not forbid reproachful
        remarks that are fittingly uttered for amusement or for a man’s
        correction (a thing to be managed without loss of good name). That man
        who acts in a pleasing and polite manner in raillery seems to be a law
        unto himself, provided. that by his own choice he avoids the things
        forbidden by the law and makes use of the things sanctioned by the law.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        863. Finally, he comes to the conclusion that the man possessing the
        mean is such as was described, whether he is called <i>epidexios</i>,
        i.e., tactful, or <i>eutrapelos</i>, i.e., witty.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        864. Next [B’, 2], at “However, the buffoon,” he explains the
        viciousness of the excess, saying that the buffoon is less vicious than
        the mocker because the mocker tries to put another to shame while the
        buffoon does not aim at this but only at getting a laugh. The latter
        spares neither himself nor others in attempting to create laughter,
        since he makes fun both of his own tales and of the sayings and deeds of
        others. Besides, he says things that a polite and virtuous person would
        not say, and some that he should not say and should not even listen to.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        865. Then [B’, 3], at “But the lout,” he treats the vice by defect,
        saying that the man who is uncultured, i.e., boorish, is useless at
        these witty conversations. He contributes nothing to them but is
        disagreeable to everyone. He is vicious in that he completely abhors
        jest, which is necessary for human living as a kind of recreation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        866. Next [C], at “In human living there are,” he deduces the difference
        between this virtue and the two previously discussed, stating that in
        human life there are the three median states mentioned, all of which
        regard communication in words and works. But they differ among
        themselves, since one of them deals with truthfulness in speech and
        action, while the others pertain to what is pleasing. One of these
        concerns pleasure taken in amusement; the other concerns pleasure taken
        in conversation according to our usual way of living, i.e., in serious
        matters.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        867. After the Philosopher has completed the treatise on the median
        qualities that are virtues, he now treats a median quality that is not a
        virtue, viz., shame. First [A] he shows that shame is not a virtue. Then
        [B], at “Likewise, continence is not etc.,” he says a similar thing
        about continence, which, although laudable, is not a virtue. He
        discusses the first point from two aspects. First [A] he investigates
        the genus of shame; and then [B’], at “This passion is not etc.,” he
        examines its subject. He treats this first in a twofold manner.
        Initially [A’, 1] he presents his proposition, saying that shame is not
        properly called a virtue. But shame is more like a passion than a habit
        which is the genus of virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        868. Next [A’, 2.], at “In any case,” he proves his proposition in two
        ways: first [A’, 2, a] by means of a definition of shame. Shame is said
        to be fear of disgrace or confusion which is the opposite of glory. But
        fear is a certain passion. Consequently, shame belongs to the genus of
        passion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        869. Then [A’, 2, b], at “Like fear,” he proves the same thing by the
        effect of shame. In this regard we must consider that passions are
        movements of the sensitive appetite that uses bodily organs. Hence all
        the passions are accompanied by some corporeal change. Shame and
        fear—which is concerned with the danger of death—have a general
        resemblance in that each passion is judged by a change in the color of
        the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        870. But they have particular differences, since people who are ashamed
        blush, while those who fear death turn pale. The reason for this
        difference is that the spirit and the humors naturally
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        rush to the place feeling the need. Now, the seat of life is the heart,
        and so when danger of death is feared, the spirit and the humors speed
        to the heart. Consequently, the surface of the body, being as it were
        deserted, grows pale. On the other hand, honor and confusion are
        numbered among external things. Therefore, since a man fears the loss of
        honor by shame, he blushes as the humors and spirits stream back to the
        surface. It is evident then that both shame and fear of death are
        certain alterations of the body inasmuch as they are accompanied by a
        change. Because this apparently belongs rather to passion than habit, it
        is obvious that shame is not a virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        871. At “This passion” [B’], he discloses what is the fitting subject of
        shame. First [B’, 1] he shows at what age it is becoming; and then [B’,
        2], at “Likewise shame is not etc.,” for what condition. He develops the
        first point in a threefold fashion. First [B’, 1, a] he presents his
        proposition, viz., that it is not becoming to persons of every age but
        to the young.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        872. Then [B’, 1, b], at “We are of the opinion,” he proves in two ways
        that shame is becoming to adolescence. In one way he shows this from the
        peculiar nature of youth, namely, that on account of the intense desires
        of their age they live according to their emotions. For that reason they
        are inclined to sin in various ways. But they are restrained from this
        because of shame by which they fear disgrace. Therefore, shame is
        becoming to youth. In the other way he gives evidence of the same thing
        from usage. We are accustomed to praise young people who have a sense of
        shame.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        873. Third [B’, 1, c], at “But no one praises,” he explains that shame
        is not becoming to another period of life, i.e., old age, saying that no
        one praises an old man for feeling shame. The reason is that we think it
        unbecoming of him to do any shameful deed from which shame usually
        arises. Besides, we think both that old men have been proved by their
        years and that they ought not to do any shameful act from passion after
        the fire of youth has subsided.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        874. Next [B’, 2], at “Likewise, shame is not” he shows to what
        condition shame is or is not becoming. He handles this point under two
        headings. First [B’, 2, a] he explains that it is not becoming to the
        virtuous person. Then [B’, 2, b], at “If some actions etc.,” he answers
        certain frivolous objections against his thesis. He says that shame does
        not belong to the man of virtue, for it occurs in regard to evil deeds.
        But the virtuous man does not do wicked actions because virtue is a
        quality which makes good both its possessor and his work. Therefore,
        shame is not becoming to a virtuous person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        875. Then [B’, 2, b], at “If some actions,” he answers three objections
        dealing with what has just been said. The first [b, i] is that someone
        might say that shame arises not only from truly disgraceful acts, which
        are contrary to virtue, but also from actions believed to be
        disgraceful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        876. But Aristotle says that it does not make any difference for our
        thesis, since the morally good man must not do things shameful either
        according to truth or opinion, and so is not in danger of being ashamed
        of anything, But the wicked person characteristically is of the sort who
        perform acts certainly disgraceful or held to be such.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        877. He introduces a second objection at “It is unreasonable” [b, ii]. A
        person could say that, although the man of virtue does not have anything
        to be ashamed of, nevertheless he is so disposed that if he did
        something of the kind, he would be ashamed of it. Therefore, in case
        anyone should think on this account that shame belongs to the virtuous
        person, he proves in two ways that this is untenable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        878. First [ii, x] he says that shame, strictly speaking, regards only
        voluntary failings for which blame is due. But it is inconsistent with
        virtue that someone should voluntarily do evil. Therefore, shame does
        not belong to virtue for the reason just given. The case would be
        otherwise if shame were among the things which can happen involuntarily
        like sickness. Hence, it can be proper for the virtuous man even when
        well to be solicitous about a doctor on account of the sickness that can
        happen.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        879. Second [ii, y], he excludes the preceding objection at “Shame will
        be.” He says that if the objection were valid, shame would be a certain
        conditional virtuous state, for the virtuous man would be ashamed if he
        were to do wrong. But a conditional state (that a man would be ashamed)
        is not one of the qualities that properly belong to virtuous people.
        Rather, it belongs to them absolutely, as is the case of all the
        virtues. We must conclude then that shame is not a special quality in a
        virtuous person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        880. At “But if shamelessness” [b, iii] he gives a third objection.
        Someone could draw the conclusion that, because shamelessness and the
        absence of shame concerning a disreputable operation is an evil thing,
        for this reason shame is virtuous.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        881. But Aristotle says that this is not a necessary inference because
        both shame and shamelessness suppose a dishonorable act which is not
        attributable to a morally good man. On this basis it is more reasonable
        that a man should reject the disgraceful operation by reason of shame
        than not care about it by reason of shamelessness. From this it is clear
        also that shame is not a virtue, for if it were a virtue it would exist
        in a virtuous person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        882. We must take into account that the Philosopher previously (356)
        treated the praiseworthy passion of righteous indignation (nemesis), and
        that here he does not mention it because it is not his intention to
        treat these passions on this occasion. This matter pertains rather to
        rhetoric, as is clear from the second book of the <i>Rhetoric</i> (Ch.
        9, 1386 b 9 sq.). Hence, neither does he here consider shame except to
        show that it is not a virtue. He leaves the same thing to be understood
        about righteous indignation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        883. Then [B], at “Likewise, continence,” he introduces something
        similar concerning continence which, although laudable, is not a virtue
        but has an admixture of virtue. Certainly, the continent man follows
        right reason, and this pertains to virtue. Nevertheless, he suffers
        vehement and evil desires, and this pertains to lack of virtue. We will
        discuss these subjects afterwards in the seventh book (1435-1454). It is
        enough that he brings out in a fitting manner shame’s resemblance to
        continence because shame is especially necessary where evil passions
        abound, as they do in continent people. We have already remarked this
        (873).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        884. Finally, he makes a connection with what follows, saying that we
        must next discuss justice. With this the teaching of the fourth book
        comes to an end.
