    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >1. For, as Augustine says, just as the soul is the life of the body, so
        God is the life of the soul. But the soul is immediately the life of the
        body. Therefore God is immediately the life of the soul. Therefore,
        since a soul is said to be alive from the fact that it has charity, as
        is said (1 John iii. 14), He that loveth not, abideth in death, man is
        not in charity through something which is a medium between God and man,
        but through God Himself. Charity, therefore, is not something created in
        the soul, but is God Himself.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >2. But it was objected that the comparison is applied only in this
        respect, that the soul is the life of the body as a mover, and not
        insofar as it is the life of the body as a form. But on the contrary, in
        proportion as any agent is more powerful, to that extent it requires
        less of a disposition in the patient; e.g., the less dry the wood is,
        the greater must be the fire sufficient to burn it. But God is an agent
        of infinite power. Therefore, if He is the life of the soul, as moving
        it to love, it seems that no created disposition on the part of this
        soul is required.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >3. Moreover, there is no medium among those things which are the same.
        But the soul loving God is the same as God, as is said (1 Cor. vi. 17),
        He who is joined to the Lord, is one in spirit. Therefore no created
        charity comes as a medium between the soul loving and God being
        loved.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >4. Moreover, the love by which we love our neighbor is charity. But the
        love by which we love our neighbor is God Himself, for Augustine says in
        Book VIII of the <i>De Trinitate</i>, He who loves his neighbor loves
        the same love. But God is love. It follows, therefore, that he
        especially loves God. Therefore charity is not something created, but is
        God Himself.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >5. But it was said that God, as a cause, is the love by which we love
        our neighbor. On the contrary, Augustine says in the same place, and he
        clearly proved it with the testimony of the words of St. John, that that
        very celestial love by which we love each other is not only from God but
        also is God. Therefore God is love not only causally, but
        essentially.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >6. Moreover, Augustine says in Book V of the <i>De Trinitate</i>, For
        we are not going to say that God is called Love because love itself is a
        substance worthy of the name of God, but because it is a gift of God, as
        it is said of God, "Thou art my patience," in that He Himself gives it
        to us. For it is not said, 0 Lord You are my love; but it is said thus,
        "God is love," as it is said, "God is a Spirit." Therefore it is that
        God is called charity not only causally, but also essentially.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >7. Moreover, when the effect of God is known, He Himself is not known
        because of this, but He is known through the knowledge of the highest
        love. For Augustine says in Book VIII of the Dc Trinitate, For he knows
        the love with which he loves, more than the brother whom he loves. So
        now he can know God more than he knows his brother. Embrace the love of
        God, and by love embrace God. Therefore God is called fraternal love not
        solely as a cause.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >8. But it was objected that when fraternal love is recognized, God is
        recognized as in His own likeness. On the contrary, man is made in the
        image and likeness of God according to the very substance of his soul.
        But this likeness is obscured through sin. Therefore, in order that God
        be able to be recognized in the soul as in His own image, it is only
        necessary that sin be taken away, and not that some created thing be
        superadded to the soul.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >9. Moreover, everything that is in the soul is either a potency, or a
        passion, or a habit, as is said in Book III of the Ethic. But charity is
        not a potency of the soul, because if it were it would be natural. Nor
        is it a passion, because it is not in a sensitive potency in which are
        all passions. Nor is it a habit, because a habit is removed with
        difficulty; charity, however, is easily lost through one act of mortal
        sin. Therefore charity is not something created in the soul.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >10. Moreover, no created thing has infinite power. But charity has
        infinite power because it joins what is infinitely far apart, viz., the
        soul to God, and it merits an infinite good. Therefore charity is not
        something created in the soul.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >11. Moreover, every creature is vanity, as is shown (Eccle. i. 2).
        Vanity, however, does not unite with truth. Therefore, since charity
        unites us to the First Truth, charity is not something created.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >12. Moreover, every created thing is a certain nature since it falls
        within one of the ten genera. Therefore, if charity is something created
        in the soul, it is a certain nature. Therefore, since we merit by
        charity, and if charity is a created thing, it follows that nature is
        the principle of meriting. This is the erroneous opinion of Pelagius.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >13. Moreover, man is closer to God according to his existence in grace
        than he is according to his existence in nature. But God created man
        without a medium according to his existence in nature. So, neither in
        man's existence in grace does God use a medium, viz., a created
        charity.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >14. Moreover, an agent which acts without a medium is more perfect than
        an agent which acts through a medium. But God is the most perfect agent.
        Therefore He acts without a medium. He does not, therefore justify the
        soul through the medium of any created thing.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >15. Moreover, a rational creature is more excellent than other
        creatures But other creatures attain their own end without anything
        superadded Therefore even more is a rational creature moved by God to
        its end with out some created thing superadded to it.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >16. But it was objected that a rational creature is not, through its
        own nature, proportionate to its end, and therefore it needs something
        super added. On the contrary, the end of man is the infinite good. But
        no created thing is proportionate to an infinite good. Therefore that by
        which man is ordered to his end is not a good created in the soul.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >17. Moreover, as God is the first light, He is also the highest good.
        But the light which is God is present to the soul, because of which it
        is said (Ps. xxxv. 10), In thy light we shall see light. Therefore the
        highest good, which is God, is also present to the soul. But the good is
        that by which we love something. Therefore that by which we love is
        God.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >18. But it was objected that the good which is God is present to the
        soul not formally but efficiently. On the contrary, God is pure form.
        Therefore He is present formally in those things in which He is
        present.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >19. Moreover, nothing is loved unless it is known, as Augustine say in
        Book X of the <i>De Trinitate</i>. Therefore according to this, a thing
        is lovable according as it is knowable. But God is, through Himself,
        knowable as the first principle of knowledge. Therefore He is lovable
        throngh Himself and not through any created charity.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >20. Moreover, a thing is lovable according as it is good. But God is
        infinite good. Therefore He is infinitely lovable. But no created love
        is infinite. Therefore, since some who have charity love God because He
        is lovable, the love by which we love God is not something created.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >21. Moreover, God loves all things which exist, as is said (Wis. xi.
        25). But He does not love irrational creatures through something
        superadded to them; therefore neither does He love rational creatures in
        this way. Thus the charity and grace according to which man is loved by
        God is not something created and superadded to the soul.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >22. Moreover, if charity is something created, it must be an accident.
        But charity is not an accident because no accident is more worthy than
        its subject. Charity, however, is more worthy than nature. Therefore
        charity is not something created in the soul.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >23. Moreover, as Bernard says, we love God and our neighbor by the same
        law by which the Father and the Son love Themselves. But the Father and
        the Son love Themselves with an uncreated love. Therefore we love God
        with an uncreated love.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >24. Moreover, that which can raise from death is of infinite power. But
        charity raises from death, for it is said (1 John iii. 14), We know that
        we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren.
        Therefore charity is of infinite power and is not something created.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >On the contrary, everything which is received in a thing is received in
        it according to the mode of the receiver. If, therefore, charity is
        received in us from God, it must be received finitely by us, according
        to our proper mode. However, every finite thing is created. Therefore
        charity is something created in us.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        ><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that there are some who have
        maintained that the charity in us by which we love God and our neighbor
        is nothing more than the Holy Spirit, as is clear from the Master in the
        First Book of the <i>Sentences</i>, dist. 17. In order that this opinion
        might be more clearly understood, it should be known that the Master
        placed this act of love by which we love God and our neighbor as a
        created thing in us, like the acts of the other virtues. But he set a
        difference between the act of charity and the acts of the other virtues.
        For, the Holy Spirit moves the soul to the acts of the other virtues by
        means of certain habitual means which are called virtues, but He moves
        the will immediately to the act of love through Himself without any
        habit, as is clear in Book I, dist. 17. It was the excellence of charity
        which moved him to posit this theory, and the words of Augustine and
        others were used in objections. However, it was ridiculous to say that
        the very act of love which we express when we love God and our neighbor
        is the Holy Spirit Itself.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >This opinion clearly cannot stand. For, just as natural actions and
        movements proceed from a certain intrinsic principle which is nature, so
        also it is necessary that actions of the will proceed from an intrinsic
        principle. And, just as the natural inclination in natural things is
        called the natural appetite, so also in rational beings, the inclination
        which follows the apprehension of the intellect is the act of the
        will.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >It is, however, possible that a natural thing be moved not by an
        intrinsic principle but by some extrinsic agent, as for instance when a
        stone thrown into the air. But it is certainly impossible that such a
        movement or action which does not proceed from an intrinsic principle be
        called natural, for this would imply a contradiction in itself. Whence,
        since for contradictories to exist at the same time does not lie within
        the divine power, it cannot even be effected by God that the upward
        motion of a stone, which does not proceed from an intrinsic principle,
        be natural to it. Now it is possible to give a stone that power by which
        it would naturally move upward as from an intrinsic principle, but that
        motion would not be natural to the stone unless another nature be given
        to it. And likewise, it cannot be effected by God that any movement of
        man, either interior or exterior, which proceeds from an extrinsic
        principle is voluntary. Whence, all the acts of the will are reduced, as
        to a pristine root, to that which man naturally wishes, which is the
        last end; and he wishes the means for the sake of the end.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >Therefore an act which exceeds the entire capabilities of human nature
        cannot be voluntary to man unless there be added to human nature
        something intrinsic, perfecting the will, so that such an action would
        proceed from an intrinsic principle. If, therefore, the act of charity
        in man does not proceed from an interior habit superadded to a natural
        potency, but proceeds from the movement of the Holy Spirit, then one of
        these two alternatives follow: either an act of charity is not
        voluntary, which is impossible because to love something is to will it;
        or it does not exceed the capability of nature, and this view is
        heretical.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >This difficulty being removed, it will follow, first, that the act of
        charity is an act of the will. Secondly, if it is granted that the act
        of the will can be entirely from an extrinsic principle, as acts of the
        hands or feet, it will also follow that if the act of charity is only
        from the movement of extrinsic principle, it cannot be meritorious. For,
        every agent which does not act according to its proper form but only
        because it is moved by a another, is an agent only instrumentally, as an
        axe is an agent only inasmuch as it is moved by a woodsman.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >Therefore if the soul does not effect an act of charity through some
        proper form, but only because it is moved by an extrinsic agent, i.e.,
        by the Holy Spirit, then it will follow that it is considered only as an
        instrument for this act. There would not be, then, in man the power to
        act or not to act, and he would not be able to gain merit. For, only
        those things are meritorious which are in us according to a certain
        manner. Thus human merit is entirely taken away, since love is the basis
        of meriting.</a

        >Thirdly it cannot hold, because it would follow that a man who is in
        charity would not be inclined to an act of charity, nor would he perform
        it with any pleasure. For, the acts of virtue are enjoyable to us
        because we are conformed to them according to a habit, and we are
        inclined toward them through the manner of a natural inclination.
        However, the act of charity is especially enjoyable and especially
        inclines one to remain in charity, and through it everything we do or
        suffer is rendered pleasing.</a

        >The conclusion, therefore, is that there must be a certain habit of
        charity created in us, which is the formal principle of the act of love.
        By this opinion it is not denied that the Holy Spirit, Who is Uncreated
        Charity, exists in man who has created charity, or that He moves man's
        soul to the act of love, as God moves all things to their own actions to
        which they are inclined by their own proper forms. And thus it is that
        He disposes all things sweetly, because to all things He gives forms and
        powers inclining them to that which He Himself moves them; so that they
        tend toward it not by force, but as if it were by their own free
        accord.</a

        effectiveness of a mover that it does not require any disposition in the
        subject, however, that mover displays its effectiveness if it impresses
        a strong disposition in that which receives or is moved. For, a great
        fire causes not only substantial form to appear, but also a strong
        disposition. That agent which moves to action, and which also impresses
        a form through that which it moves, is stronger than that mover which so
        moves to action that it impresses no form. Therefore, because the Holy
        Spirit is the most powerful mover, He so moves to love that He also
        causes a habit of charity.</a

        He who is joined to the Lord, is one in spirit, this is not meant a
        unity of substance, but a unity of affection between the lover and the
        loved. By this union the habit of charity is regarded more as a
        principle of love than as a medium between the lover and the loved, for
        the act of love pass immediately to God as to the loved, but not
        immediately into the habit of charity.</a

        Augustine said that he who loves his neighbor knows the love by which he
        loves more than he knows the neighbor whom he loves, he seems to
        understand the very act of love. Now no one holds that this act is
        something uncreated; therefore it cannot be concluded that the love thus
        known is God. Therefore when we perceive in ourselves an act of love, we
        feel a certain participation of God because God Himself is love, not
        because He is that very act of love which we perceive.</a

        Augustine says in <i>Super Joan.</i>, He who created thee without thee

        He acts mediately in order that He might preserve order in things. But
        if we speak of a formal medium, it is clearthat as the agent is more
        perfect, so much more will he induce a form. For an imperfect agent does

    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >1. A virtue concerns what is difficult, according to the Philosopher in
        Book VI of the <i>Ethics</i>. But charity does not pertain to the
        difficult; rather, as Augustine says in the <i>De Verbis Domini</i>,
        Love makes all hard and repulsive tasks easy and next to nothing.
        Therefore charity is not a virtue.</a

    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >2. But it was objected that what is done through virtue is difficult in
        the beginning but easy in the end. On the contrary, in the beginning
        there is not yet a virtue. If, therefore, it is difficult only in the
        beginning, virtue will not pertain to what is difficult.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >3. Moreover, the difficulty in virtues arises from contraries, for it
        becomes difficult to preserve temperance because of the contrary
        concupiscences. But charity pertains to the highest good for which there
        is no contrary. Therefore that which pertains to charity is neither
        difficult in the end nor in the beginning.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >4. Moreover, to esteem or to love is to wish a certain thing. But the
        Apostle says (Rom. vii. 18), To will, is present with me. Therefore to
        love is present to us. There is, therefore, required for this no other
        virtue of charity.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >5. Moreover, in our mind there is only intellect and appetite. But the
        intellect is elevated to God by faith; the affective power by hope. It
        is, therefore, not necessary to posit a third virtue of charity to
        elevate the mind to God.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >6. But it should be objected that hope elevates but does not join
        together, whence there is need for charity which will unite. On the
        contrary, hope, because it does not join, always concerns that which is
        not joined. Hope is not necessary for those who are united to God
        through the enjoyment of beatitude. If charity unites, by the same
        reasoning it does not belong to those who are not yet united, i.e., to
        those living in this life. But virtue perfects us in this life, for it
        is a disposition of that which is perfect to that which is best.
        Therefore charity is not a virtue.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >7. Moreover, grace adequately joins us to God. Therefore the virtue of
        charity is needed to unite us to God. 8. Moreover, charity is a certain
        friendship of man to God. But friendship of man to man is not included
        by philosophers among the political virtues. Therefore the love of God
        ought not to be numbered among the theological virtues.</a

      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >10. Moreover, virtue, according to the Philosopher, is a mean. But
        charity is not a mean because there can be nothing beyond the love of
        God. Therefore charity is not a virtue.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >11. Moreover, the affective power is corrupted more through sin that is
        the intellect, because sin is in the will, as Augustine says. But our
        intellect is not able to see God in this state of life immediately as He
        is in Himself. Neither is our affective power able to love God in this
        state of life immediately as He is in Himself. But to love God as He is
        in Himself is attributed to charity. Therefore charity ought not to be
        numbered among the virtues which perfect us in this life.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >12. Moreover, virtue is the ultimate limit of a power, as is said in
        Book I of the <i>De Caelo</i>. But enjoyment is the ultimate limit which
        pertains to the affective power. Therefore enjoyment ought to be a
        greater virtue than love.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >13. Moreover, every virtue has its proper measure; whence Augustine
        says that sin, which is the opposite of virtue, is a privation of mode,
        species and order. But charity does not have a measure, because as
        Bernard says, the measure of charity is to love without measure.
        Therefore charity is not a virtue.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >14. Moreover, one virtue is not designated by another, because all the
        species of the same genus are divided through opposition. But charity is
        designated by the other virtues, for it is written (1 Cor. xiii. 4),
        Charity is patient, is kind. Therefore charity is not a virtue.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >15. Moreover, according to the Philosopher in Book VIII of the
        <i>Ethics</i>, friendship consists in a certain equality. But there is
        the greatest innequality between God and us, as between beings who are
        infinitely separated. Therefore there can be no friendship of God for
        us, or of us for God. So charity, which designates friendship of this
        kind, does not seem to be a virtue. 16. Moreover, love of the highest
        good is natural to us. But virtue is not natural, because virtues are
        not in us by nature, as is clear from Book II of the <i>Ethics</i>.
        Therefore love of the highest good, which is charity, is not a
        virtue.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >17. Moreover, love is more excellent than fear. But fear, because of
        its own excellence, is not a virtue but a gift, which is more excellent
        than a virtue. Therefore neither is charity a virtue but a gift.</a

        virtues. Now the act of charity is commanded in the law, for it is
        written (Matt. xii. 37), that the first and greatest commandment is,
        Love the Lord thy God. Therefore charity is a virtue.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        ><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that charity is, without a doubt, a
        virtue. Now since a virtue is that which makes its possessor good and
        renders his works good, it is clear that man is ordered to his proper
        good according to the proper virtue. But the proper good of man must be
        considerd in various ways, according as man is understood under various
        aspects. The proper good of man as man is the good of reason, in that to
        be a man is to be rational. But the good of man considered as an artist
        is the good of art; so also considered in his political character, his
        good is the common good of the state. Since virtue operates for good, it
        is necessary for virtue of any kind that it operate well for the good,
        i.e., voluntarily, readily, with delight and firmly. These are the
        conditions of virtuous operation which are not found in any operation
        unless the agent love the good for which he is working, because love is
        the principle of all the voluntary affective powers. For, that which is
        loved is desired when it is not possessed; there is pleasure when it is
        possessed; and those things which prevent one from having what has been
        loved cause sadness. Also, those things which are done out of love are
        done steadily, rapidly and with delight. Therefore love of the good, for
        which virtue operates, is necessary for virtue.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >But that virtue which belongs to man as man operates for a good that is
        connatural to man. Therefore the love of this good, which is the good of
        reason, is by nature in his will. But if we accept the virtue of man
        according to some other consideration that is not natural to man, it
        will be necessary for virtue of this kind that love of that good to
        which such a virtue is ordered be something superadded to the nature of
        the will. For the artist does not operate well unless the love of the
        good which is intended through the operation of his art be added to him.
        Whence the Philosopher says in Book VIII of the <i>Politics</i>, for one
        to be considered politically good, he must love the good of the state.
        But when man becomes a citizen of a state and is admitted to
        participating in the good of some state, certain virtues are suitable,
        necessary even, for doing those things which are a citizen's duty and
        for loving the good of the state. Therefore man, through grace, becomes
        as it were a citizen and a sharer in this blessed society which is
        called the heavenly Jerusalem (Ephes. ii. 19), You are fellow-citizens
        with the saints, and the domestics of God. And in this way, man is
        admitted to participating in celestial beatitude which consists in the
        vision and enjoyment of God. Therefore certain gratuitous virtues, which
        are infused, are necessary for man when he is enrolled in the heavenly
        state; for the proper operation of these virtues there is required the
        love of the common good for the whole society, which is the divine good
        considered as the object of beatitude.</a

        >But to love the good of any society involves a twofold consideration:
        first, the manner in which it is obtained; secondly, the manner in which
        it is preserved. But to love the good of any society so that it might be
        had or possessed, does not constitute the political good. Thus does a
        tyrant love the good of the state in order to dominate it, which is to
        love himself more than the state; for he desires this good for himself,
        not for the state. But to love the good of the state so that it might be
        preserved and defended, this is indeed to love the state, and this
        constitutes the political good. So much is this so, that men would
        expose themselves to dangers of death or neglect their own private good,
        in order to preserve or increase the good of the state. Therefore, to
        love the good in which the blessed participate so that it might be had
        or possessed does not make man well-disposed toward beatitude, because
        the wicked also desire this good. But to love that good for its own sake
        in order that it might remain and be made wide-spread, and that nothing
        might act against that good, this does dispose man well toward that
        society of the blessed. This is charity, which loves God for His own
        sake, and loves fellow-men who are capable of attaining beatitude as it
        loves itself; charity resists every hindrance both in itself and in
        others; charity can never exist with mortal sin, that obstacle to
        beatitude. Therefore it is clear that charity is not only a virtue, but
        even the most powerful of the virtues.</a

        considered in this respect: that a man consider his friend as another
        self, and wishes good for him as he does for himself. But to unite in
        reality, this is not the nature of charity. Therefore there can be a
        love both of what is possessed and what is not possessed. It makes one

        he loves what is like himself, i.e., virtuous men in whom the good of
        reason is strong. But the friendship which is for God, Who is blessed
        and the author of beatitude, ought to be included among the virtues
        which order men to beatitude. Therefore, since it is not consequent to

        no measure, because there is no fixed terminus of divine love which, if

        can happen with the moral virtues which are means between extremes. The

      <a name="3" id="3"
        ><b>I answer.</b> Charity is the form, moving power and root of the
        virtues. This can be shown by the fact that we must judge habits by
        their acts. So when what belongs to one habit is formal in the act of
        another habit, that habit must be related to the other as its form. But
        in all voluntary acts the end is what gives the form. That is because
        every act takes its form and species according to the form of the
        agents, such as heating from heat. But the form of thewill is its
        object, which is the good and the end, just as the intelligible is the
        form of the intellect. So that which has relation to the end must be
        formally in the act of the will. Thus in species, the same act is
        considered under the form of a virtue if it is ordered to one end, or
        under the form of a vice if it is ordered to another end. This is clear
        from the example of one who gives alms either for the sake of God or for
        the sake of vainglory. For, the act of one vice, according as it is
        ordered to the end of another vice, receives the form of the second
        vice; e.g., he who would steal in order to commit adultery is a thief
        materially, but formally he is considered intemperate. It is clear that
        the act of all the other virtues is ordered to the proper end of
        charity, which is its object, viz., the highest good. This is certainly
        clear regarding the moral virtues, for virtues of this kind are
        concerned with certain created goods which are ordered to the uncreated
        good as to their final end. And the same is clearly evident regarding
        the theological virtues; for uncreated being as true is indeed the
        object of faith; and insofar as it is desirable, it has the aspect of
        the good. Thus faith is directed toward that good insofar as it is
        desirable, since no one believes unless he wishes to believe. Even
        though the object of this species (i.e., the theological virtues) is
        uncreated being considered as good, nevertheless the object is still
        derived from the object of charity; for, the good is the object of hope
        insofar as it can be desired and obtained, since no one desires to
        obtain some good unless he loves it.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="3" id="3"
        >Therefore it is evident that in the acts of all the virtues there is
        the formal element which comes from charity; and it is called the form
        of all the virtues in that every act of all the virtues is ordered to
        the highest good that is loved, as has just been shown. And because the
        precepts of the law are concerned with the acts of the virtues, so it is
        that the Apostle writes (1 Tim. i. 5), The end of the commandment is
        charity. Thus it is apparent how charity can be the mover of all the
        virtues; it is the mover because it influences the acts of all the other
        virtues. For, every higher act or power is said to move a lower act or
        power, so that the act of the lower is ordered to the end of the higher.
        For example, a house-builder commands a stone-mason so that the act of
        the stone-mason is ordered to the form of the house, which is the end of
        the builder. Since all the other virtues are ordered to the end of
        charity, charity commands the acts of all the virtues; and for this
        reason it is called their mover. And because the word "mother" signifies
        someone who receives and conceives within herself, charity is called the
        mother of the virtues. For this same reason, charity is called the root
        of the virtues.</a

        respect to another, as color is the proper form in respect to what can
        be seen. It is in this way that charity can be the form of the other

        the will. But in its operation and moving, the will is prior. For, the
        intellect does not understand or move unless the will gives its consent.
        Thus does the will move the intellect insofar as it is operative; for we
        use our intellect when we will. Therefore, since to believe is an act of
        the intellect as moved by the will—for we believe something because we
        wish to—it follows that charity gives form to faith more so than faith

        considered according to the one who wills in relation to things as they
        are in themselves. But the act of the intellect is considered according
        as things known are in the one who understands. Whence, when things are
        below the one who understands, then the intellect is higher than the
        will, because things exist in a higher manner in the intellect than in
        themselves, since everything which is in another is in it according to
        the manner of that in which it is. But when the things are above the one
        who understands, then the will rises higher than the intellect is able
        to attain. Thus it is that in moral matters, which concern things below
        man, the cognitive virtue informs the appetitive virtues, just as
        prudence informs the other moral virtues. But in the theological virtues
        which concern God, the virtue of the will, viz., charity, informs the

        contrary, the Philosopher says in Book IX of the <i>Ethics</i>, that
        friendly relations with another come from a man's relations to himself.

        brother, whom he seeth, how can he love 'God, whom he seeth not?
        Therefore we ought to love our neighbor more than God. Since our
        neighbor is to be loved more than God, he is the more primary object of
        charity.</a

        regard to its acts; for a just man not only does just deeds, but also
        acts justly. Charity uses two modes in its acts; for in charity one
        loves God with his whole heart, and he loves his neighbor as himself.

        intention of the law-giver is to make men virtuous, as is seen in Book
        II of the <i>Ethics</i>. But two precepts are given for charity: Love
        the Lord thy God, and love your neighbor. Therefore charity is not one

        them. But we honor God and neighbor with different forms of honor; we
        honor God with adoration (<i>latria</i>), and our neighbor only with
        veneration (<i>dulia</i>). Therefore there is one kind of charity by
        which we love God and another by which we love our fellow-men.</a

        pertains to one life, to love neighbor pertains to another life; for to
        love God seems to belong to the contemplative life, while loving one's
        neighbor belongs to the active life. Therefore love of God and of our

        <i>Physics</i>, one is considered in three ways: as the continuous, as
        the indivisible, and as having the same essence. But charity does not
        have the unity of continuity because it is neither a body nor the form
        of a body. Nor has it the unity of indivisibility because then it would
        be neither finite nor infinite. Nor is it one in definition because
        synonymous things are one in this way, as raiment and dress. Therefore
        charity is not one.</a

        genus nor in number, as is said in Book V of the <i>Metaphysics</i>;
        even less are those things which are one only by analogy considered in
        the definition of the one. But charity is directed toward the eternal,
        viz., God and neighbor, who are not in the same relationship. Therefore
        in no way is charity considered one virtue.</a

        by which God and neighbor are loved, is the most perfect friendship.
        Therefore it is not directed to many. Thus God and neighbor are not
        loved with the same charity.</a

        that we be not saddened, is different from a vitrue which is performed
        with pleasure; as fortitude is different from justice. But in the act of
        charity, it is sufficient that we act without sadness in regard to some
        objects, as when we love our enemies; but it is necessary that we act
        with enjoyment in regard to others, as when we love God and our friends.

        >I answer. It must be said that charity is one virtue. To understand
        this, it must be said that any unity of power or of habit should be
        considered from the object, and this is because the potency is that
        which is said to have an order to the possible, which is the object. And
        thus the formal notion and the species of potency is taken from the
        object. It is the same for a habit, which is nothing more than a
        disposition of a perfected potency toward its object.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="4" id="4"
        >In the object, however, something is considered as form, and something
        else as matter. The form in an object is that according to which the
        object is related to a potency or to a habit; but the matter is that in
        which the formal notion has its foundation. Thus, if we speak of the
        object of the power of sight, its formal object is color, or something
        of this kind, for according as a thing is colored, thus is it visible.
        Materially, however, it is the body in which the color exists.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="4" id="4"
        >From this it is clear that a power or habit is related essentially to
        the formal notion of the object and only accidentally to the matter of
        the object. Whatever is accidental does not cause a change in the thing,
        but only that which is essential; therefore a material diversity in the
        object does not cause a diversity of power or habit because only a
        formal diversity causes this. There is one power of sight by which we
        see stones and men and the sky, because this diversity of objects is
        material and does not come from the formal notion of the visible. The
        sense of taste, however, differs from the sense of smell insofar as
        there is a difference between flavor and odor, which are sensibles in
        themselves.</a

    <p>
      <a name="4" id="4"
        >Now this consideration is necessary in regard to charity. It is evident
        that we can love something in a twofold way; in the first, by reason of
        its very self, and in the second by reason of another. We love someone
        for himself when we love him because of his proper good, viz., because
        he is essentially noble or because he is pleasing or useful to us. But
        we love someone for the sake of another when we love him because he is
        related to someone else whom we love. If we love someone on his own
        account, we love his entire family, his relatives, his friends, inasmuch
        as they are related to him; but in all of these, there is only one
        formal notion of love, viz., the good of the one whom we love for his
        own sake. And, in a certain way, we love him in all these others.</a

    <p>

        because of Him, it loves all others according as they are ordered to
        God. Thus, in a way, charity loves God in all fellow-men, for our
        neighbor is loved by charity because God is in him or God might be in
        him. It is evident that it is the same habit of charity by which we love

        >To the second, it must be said that since love looks to the good, there
        is a diversity of love according as there is a diversity of the good.
        There is, however, a certain good proper to each man considered as one
        person, and as far as loving this good is concerned, each one is the
        principal object of his own love. But there is a certain common good
        which pertains to this man or that man insofar as he is considered as
        part of a whole; thus there is a certain common good pertaining to a
        soldier considered as part of the army, or to a citizen as part of the
        state. As far as loving this common good is concerned, the principal
        object of love is that in which the good primarily exists; just as the
        good of the army is in the general, or the good of the state is in the
        king. Whence, it is the duty of a good soldier that he neglect even his
        own safety in order to save the good of his general. Thus also does a
        man naturally endanger his arm in order to save his head. And in this
        way charity regards the divine good as its principal object, which
        pertains to every one according as he is able to be a sharer in
        beatitude; thus we love out of charity only those objects which are able
        to participate in eternal happiness with us, as Augustine says in the

        which is better is more lovable, even though it is not better known. For
        example, a man loves his servant or even his horse which he has had in

        pertain to the contemplative life, becomes prayer for fellow-man. So,
        too, the principle of the active life is, in a special way, the love of

        to himself. But inasmuch as friendship towards one becomes more perfect
        as regards that one, the more perfect the love we have toward one, the
        better able are we to love others. Thus charity, because it is the most
        perfect friendship, extends itself to God and to all who are able to
        know God; it includes not only those whom we know, but also our

        virtue, because a general virtue is included in the definition of each
        special virtue. But charity is included in the definition of each
        virtue, for Jerome says, Let me briefly define all virtue as the charity
        by which we love God and our neighbor. Therefore charity is not a

        distinct from charity by which we love God; because charity loves
        fellow-man because of God. But every virtue loves fellow-man because of
        God. Therefore no virtue is distinguished from charity.</a

        virtues. But charity carries into effect the acts of all the other
        virtues, as is said (1 Cor. xiii. 4), Charity is patient, is kind.
        Therefore charity is not a virtue distinct from the others.</a

        virtue is that which makes its possessor good and renders his works
        good. But the good is the object of charity. Therefore charity has a
        general object, and thus it is a general virtue.</a

        is in diverse subjects, for we are commanded to love God with our whole
        mind, with our whole soul, with our whole heart, and with our whole
        strength. Therefore charity is not one virtue.</a

        charity is sufficient to take away all sins, because the least bit of
        charity can resist any temptation. Therefore charity does that which
        belongs to all the virtues, and so does not seem to be a special
        virtue.</a

        charity alone sufficiently directs us in right acting, for Augustine
        says, Have charity and do what you wirh. Therefore there is no other
        virtue outside of charity; and charity is not a special virtue distinct
        from the others.</a

        man might act promptly and with enjoyment, for no one is just who does
        not rejoice in just works, as is said in Book I of the <i>Ethics</i>.
        But charity is sufficient for the prompt and enjoyable operation of all
        works, for Augustine writes in the <i>De Verbis Domini</i>, Love makes
        all hard and repulsive tasks easy and next to nothing. Therefore there
        is no need for any virtue outside of charity.</a

        distinct generation and a distinct corruption. But charity and the other
        virtues do not have distinct generations and corruptions because all the
        other virtues are communicated along with charity and they are lost when
        charity is lost. Therefore charity is not a special virtue.</a

      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        ><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that charity is a special virtue,
        distinct from the other virtues. To understand this, it must be
        considered that whenever any act depends upon several principles that
        are constituted according to a certain order, it is necessary for the
        perfection of this act that each of the principles be perfect. For, if
        there be an imperfection in the beginning, or in the middle, or in the
        end, an imperfect act follows; just as if knowledge of art is lacking in
        the artist, Or a right disposition be lacking in the instrument, an
        imperfect work will follow. And this can also be considered in the very
        powers of the soul. For, if right reason, which is the mover of the
        inferior powers, be correct, and the concupiscible attitude is
        disordered, one will indeed act according to reason, but the operation
        will be imperfect, for he will have hindrance from the ill-disposed
        concupiscence tending toward its contrary. This is clear in the example
        of the continent man. Therefore in addition to prudence, which perfects
        reason, it is necessary in order that man be rightly constituted with
        regard to the objects of the concupiscible appetite, that he possess
        temperance in order that he might act readily and without hindmance.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >Just as among diverse powers, one of which moves the other, so one may
        consider diverse objects, one of which is ordered to the other as to an
        end. For, one and the same power, insofar as it is an end, not only
        moves another power, but even moves itself regarding the means to the
        end. Therefore, for right operation it is necessary that something not
        only be well-disposed toward the end, but also that it be well-disposed
        toward the means to the end. Otherwise, an impeded operation follows, as
        is clear in the case of one who is well-disposed toward attaining good
        health, but is ill-disposed toward undertaking the means which bring
        about health. Thus it is clear that, since man is disposed through
        charity to be well-ordered toward his final end, it is necessary to have
        other virtues by which he will be well-disposed toward the means which
        pertain to the end.</a

    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >Charity, therefore, is different from the virtues which are ordered to
        the means to the end; even though that virtue which is ordered to the
        end is more primary and architectonic with respect to the other virtues,
        which are ordered to the means to the end. In this way, medical
        knowledge is related to the art of applying unguents, or the military
        art is related to horsemanship.</a

    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"

        has God as the formal notion of the object, and not only as the final
        end, as it clear from the preceding Article. The other virtues have God,
        not as the formal notion of the object, but as their final end.</a

    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"

        on account of God, the on account of denotes only the final cause.</a

    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"

        the other virtues by eliciting them, but only by commanding them. For,
        the virtue draws out only those acts which are according to the notion
        of proper form, as justice acts rightly or temperance acts temperately.
        But virtue is said to command all the acts which it summons up to its

    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >To the sixth, it must be said that charity exists as in a subject in
        only one power, viz., the will which, through its command, moves the
        other powers. According to this, we are commanded to love God with our
        whole mind and our whole soul in order that all the powers of our soul
        might be summoned in submission to divine love.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >To the seventh, it must be said that, just as charity commands the acts
        of the other virtues, so through this manner of commanding does it
        exclude the sins which are contrary to these virtues; and in this way
        charity resists temptations. However, it is necessary that there be
        other virtues which directly and in an elicited way drive out sins.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >To the eighth, it must be said that, just as the acts of the other
        virtues are ordered to the end which is the object of charity, so also
        do sins, which are contrary to those virtues, oppose the end which is
        the object of charity. From this it happens that the contraries of the
        other virtues, viz., sins, drive out charity.<br />
        To the ninth, it must be said that, although charity adequately directs
        us through its manner of commanding in all things which pertain to a
        righteous life, nevertheless other virtues are required which, by
        eliciting their acts, carry out the command of charity so that man will
        act readily and without impediment.</a

    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >To the tenth, it must be said that it sometimes happens that a thing
        which in itself is difficult and causes sadness may exist for the sake
        of an end; as one freely takes a bitter medicine for the sake of health,
        although he is much afflicted by its consumption. Charity, therefore,
        makes all things pleasing in respect to the end, but the other virtues
        are needed which make those things which are good in themselves more
        enjoyable, in order that we may more easily do them.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >To the eleventh, it must be said that charity is generated at the same
        time as the other virtues, not because it is not distinct from the
        others, but because the works of God are perfect. Whence, when charity
        is communicated, all the virtues which are necessary for salvation are
        communicated at the same time. However, charity is corrupted at the same
        time as the virtues because whatever is opposed to the other virtues is
        opposed to charity, as has been said.</a

        little. But one commits mortal sin suddenly, through his consent alone.
        Therefore he who is in a perfect state through charity cannot fall away
        from charity through one act of mortal sin. Thus charity can exist along

    <p>
      <a name="6" id="6"
        >3. Moreover, charity is stronger than the habit of a moral virtue. But
        the habit of virtue is not taken away through one act of vice, since it
        is not generated through one act; for virtue is generated and corrupted
        by doing the same things in a contrary manner, as is said in Book II of
        the <i>Ethics</i>. Therefore much less is the habit of charity taken
        away through a single mortal sin.</a

        charity is a special virtue, as has been shown. Therefore there is
        opposed to it one special vice. Thus charity is not taken away by other
        mortal sins, and so it seems that it is possible for mortal sin to exist

        one drives out the other. But some sins are not in the same subject with
        charity, for charity is in the higher reason which is turned to God; but
        mortal sin can exist in the lower reason, as Augustine says in the
        <i>De Trinitate</i> 7 Therefore not every mortal sin drives out

        by what is the weakest. But charity is the strongest, for it is said
        (Cantic. viii. 6), Love is strong as death. But sin is the weakest
        because evil is infirm and powerless, as Dionysius says. Therefore
        mortal sin does not drive out charity, and so it can exist along with

    <p>

        contemplation of God. But there is no contrary to that delight which
        comes from speculative knowledge, as the Philosopher says in Book I of
        the <i>Topics</i>. Therefore there is no contrary to charity, and so it

        that is potentially movable, and not in regard to another. But charity
        is the universal mover of all the virtues, as was said above in Article
        III. Therefore it is not necessary that its operation towards one virtue
        be hindered insofar as it moves the others. Thus charity is able to

        have charity can be imperfect; for oftentimes those who have charity are
        moved by another movement to impatience, or to vainglory. Therefore it
        may happen that the habit of charity is imperfect and without form, and
        thus it seems that mortal sin can exist with charity.</a

        to science. But not every ignorance takes away complete science.
        Therefore not every mortal sin takes away all virtue. Whence, since
        charity is the root of the virtues, it does not seem that every mortal
        sin takes away charity.</a

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="6" id="6"

        love towards a thing can act against it through incontinence; just as
        one loving himself acts against his good through incontinence; and
        another loving his community acts against it through incontinence, as
        the Philosopher says in Book V of the <i>Politics</i>. Therefore one can
        act against God by sinning and still remain in charity.</a

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="6" id="6"
        >15. Moreover, one can be well-disposed toward the universal, and yet
        fail in the particular. For example, the incontinent man has right
        reason toward the universal, viz., that it is wrong to commit
        fornication; but yet in regard to the particular, he chooses here and
        now to commit fornication as a good, as is explained by the Philosopher
        in Book VI of the <i>Ethics</i>. But charity causes man to keep himself
        well-disposed toward the universal end. Therefore, remaining in charity,
        one can sin in regard to some particular act, and thus charity can exist
        with mortal sin.</a

        of act because sin is something said, done, or desired contrary to the
        law of God. But charity is in the genus of habit. Therefore sin is not
        contrary to charity, and so does not drive out charity. It is,
        therefore, able to exist with charity.</a

        >(2) Moreover, whoever has charity is worthy of eternal life, according
        to the Apostle (1I Tim. iv. 8), There is laid up for me a crown of
        justice, which the Lord the /ust judge will render to me in that day:
        and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming. However,
        whoever sins mortally is worthy of eternal punishment, according to what
        is written (Rom. vi. 23), The wages of sin is death. But no one can at
        the same time be worthy of eternal life and of eternal punishment.
        Therefore charity cannot be retained with mortal sin.</a

      <a name="6" id="6"
        >I answer. It must be said that charity can, in no way, exist along with
        mortal sin. To prove this, it must be considered, first, that every
        mortal sin is directly opposed to charity. Whoever chooses something in
        preference to something else, loves better that which he first chooses.
        Whence, because man loves his own life itnd his own continuance more
        than pleasure, however great that pleasure may be, he is drawn away from
        pleasure if he thinks that it is infallibly destructive of his own life.
        This is explained by Augustine when he writes in the
        <i>LXXXIII Quaestionum</i>, that there is no one who fears pain more
        than he who seeks pleasure. Sometimes we even see that the most savage
        of beasts will avoid the greatest pleasures because of the fear of pain.
        However, one sins mortally in this, that he prefers something other than
        to live according to God and to cling to God. Thus it is clear that
        whoever sins mortally, by this fact he loves some other good more than
        he loves God; for if he would love God, he would choose to live
        according to God more than to obtain some temporal good. However, it is
        of the very essence of charity that God be loved above all things, as is
        clear from what is said above. Therefore every mortal sin is contrary to
        charity.</a

        >Charity is founded in man by God. But those things which are caused by
        divine infusion are in need of divine action not only in the beginning
        so that they might begin to exist, but also in their entire duration so
        that they might be preserved in existence. For example, the illumination
        of the air needs the presence of the sun not only when the air is first
        lighted, but as long as it remains lighted. And for this reason, if any
        intervening obstacle prevents the direct rays of the sun, the light in
        the air fails. Likewise, when mortal sin enters, which obstructs the
        soul's direct sight of God—and through this something else is preferred
        to God—the flow of charity is stopped, and charity is then lacking in
        man, as is said (Isaiah. lix. 2), Your iniquities have divided between
        you and your God.</a

        was, does not suddenly lose charity. The words are to be interpreted to
        mean that it does not easily happen that a perfect man would suddenly
        commit a mortal sin at once, but through negligence; and many venial
        sins would be disposed finally to fall into mortal sin.</a

        God exerts in the operation of charity is taken away; therefore one act
        of sin takes away charity.</a

        to the movement of charity in the lower part of the soul, drives out
        charity. Or, it can be answered that mortal sin does not exist without
        consent, which is attributed to the higher faculty of reason in which
        charity exists.</a

        love God above all things, as He ought to be loved in charity; but there

        this thing, he despises the law of God.</a

        speculative knowledge, does not have a contrary in the same genus so
        that the consideration of some other thing would be contrary to it. This
        is because the species of contraries are not contrary in the
        understanding; whence, the delight which comes from a consideration of
        white is not contrary to the delight which comes from a consideration of
        black. Since the act of the will consists in the movement of the soul
        toward the thing willed, and just as things in themselves are
        contraries, so the movements of the will towards these contraries are
        contraries. For, the desire of sweetness is contrary to the desire of
        the bitter. According to this, the love of God is contrary to the love
        of sin which excludes one from God. However, speculative knowledge,
        insofar as there is no contrary, is not a proper act of charity which is
        elicited by it, but charity is only commanded by it as its effect.</a

        of the virtues, when it is impeded through mortal sin in regard to those
        things which pertain to one virtue, is impeded in regard to its own
        universal object; and because of this it is universally impeded in
        regard to all. However, this is not true when the object that is
        potentially movable is so hindered in regard to its particular effect,
        so that it is not hindered in regard to those things which pertain to
        universal virtue.</a

        doesnot render virtue without form, but only that defect which removes
        the order to the final end. Indeed, there is an order in the charity of
        this life, although the charity of this life does not have the
        perfection of the charity of heaven which is in accord with its proper
        and perfect enjoyment of God.</a

        one possessing charity, but they do not follow from charity. For, not
        every act of the agent is the act of each form in the agent, and this is
        especially true in a rational nature which possesses freedom to exercise
        those habits in it.</a

        principles does take away science, and when these principles are
        unknown, it follows that there is an ignorance of art, as is said in
        Book I of the <i>Elench</i>. However, the final end is regarded as the
        most common principle to all. Therefore, a de-ordination from the final
        end through mortal sin completely removes charity. But every
        de-ordination of particular principles does not remove charity, as is
        clear with venial sins.</a

        against a good which he loves, thinks that the good is not completely
        lost through that incontinent act which he is doing. For, if anyone who
        loves a certain state, or the health of his own body, would think that
        he would lose either of these through what he is doing, he would either
        abstain totally from those acts, or he would love that which he did more
        than his health or the good of the state. Whence, although one knows
        that he loses God through mortal sin—which is to know that he has sinned
        mortally—and nevertheless is doing that incontinent act, he clearly
        loves what he is doing more than he loves God.</a

        there be a disposition to the universal, that God be loved above all
        things, but also that the act of choice and of the will be so disposed
        toward any particular that is chosen. And this particular choice is
        excluded through the choice of the contrary, viz., sin, which excludes
        one from God.</a

        therefore, a rational nature is the object of charity, it would be
        necessary that we love God in charity. But this seems impossible, since
        the love of charity is a perfect love. We cannot love God perfectly in
        this life because we do not know Him perfectly in this life; and we do
        not know what God is but only what He is not. But love presupposes
        knowledge, since nothing is loved unless it is known. Therefore a
        rational or intellectual nature is not the proper object of charity.</a

        that angels do not have to be loved out of charity. Therefore
        intellectual nature is not the proper object of charity. The proof of
        the minor is given: friendship consists in a sharing of life, for,
        according to the Philosopher in the <i>Ethics</i>, to live together is
        proper to friends. But there does not seem to be any sharing of life
        between the angels and us, because we do not share with the angels in
        the life of nature, for they are more excellent in nature than man. Nor,
        again, do we share with them in the life of glory, for the gifts of
        grace and of glory are given by God according to the active capacity of
        the one receiving, as is said (Matt. xxv. 15), To every one He gave
        according to his proper ability. But the capacity for action of the
        angel is much greater than that of man. Therefore the angels do not
        share with men in any life.</a

        of charity. But it seems that man ought not to love himself out of
        charity. Therefore the object of charity is not a rational nature. The
        proof of the minor: the precepts of the law are given concerning the
        acts of the virtues. But there is no precept given that one should love

        charity, this preposition out of designates the relation of a cause of
        some sort. But it cannot indicate the relation of a material cause,
        since charity is not something material, but is spiritual. Again, it
        does not indicate the relation of a final cause, because the end of the
        one loving out of charity is not charity, but rather it is God.
        Likewise, neither does it indicate the relation of an efficient cause,
        because it is the Holy Spirit Who moves us to love, as is said (Rom. v.
        5), The charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost,
        who is given to us. And again, it does not indicate the relation of a
        formal cause, because charity is not an intrinsic form since it does not
        come from the essence of a thing; nor is it the extrinsic exemplary
        form, for then all things which are loved out of charity would be
        located in the species of charity, just as imitations are located in the
        species of the exemplar. Therefore rational creatures are not to be
        loved out of charity.</a

        our neighbor is he from whom some favor is received. But we receive
        favors from God. Therefore God is our neighbor. Thus it was not
        correctly posited by Augustine that God is one object of love out of

    <p>
      <a name="7" id="7"

        seems that He ought to be posited as another object of love, in addition
        to God and neighbor. There are, therefore, five objects to be loved in
        charity, and not just four, as Augustine says.</a

        which come under the act of any power or habit, the formal notion of the
        object of that power or habit must be considered. For, it is in terms of
        their relation to that notion that things come under that power or
        habit; just as in the case of things visible, it is in terms of their
        relationship to one and the same notion of being able to be seen, that
        they are either essentially or accidentally visible.</a

        >However, since the object of love taken universally is the good taken
        commonly, it is necessary that there be some special good as the object
        of each special love. For example, the proper object of natural
        friendship, which is friendship toward blood-relatives, is a natural
        good considered as something produced from parents; in a political
        friendship, however; the object is the good of the state. Charity,
        therefore, has a certain special good as its proper object, viz., the
        good of divine beatitude, as was said above in Article IV of this
        Question. Thus, according as things are related to this good, so also
        are they lovable out of charity. But it should be considered that, since
        to love is to wish the good of someone, that which is said to be loved
        has a twofold consideration: it is considered either as one for whom we
        wish the good; or as the good which we wish for someone.</a

        >Therefore, in this first way, only those things can be loved out of
        charity for which we are able to wish the good of eternal beatitude, for
        they are the things which were begotten to enjoy a good of this kind.
        Whence, since only intellectual nature was begotten to enjoy the good of
        eternal beatitude, then only intellectual nature is to be loved out of
        charity, according as those things for which we wish this good are said
        to be loved.</a

        >And for this reason, Augustine distinguishes four objects to be loved
        out of charity according as various things can have eternal beatitude in
        various ways.</a

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="7" id="7"
        >For, there is that which has eternal beatitude through its own essence,
        and this is God; and that which has it through participation, and this
        is the rational creature; both that one that loves, as well as other
        creatures which can be associated with it in the sharing in beatitude.
        However, there is something else to which it pertains to have an eternal
        beatitude, but only through a certain return, viz., our body which is
        glorified through a redundance of glory from the soul to itself.
        Therefore God ought to be loved out of charity as the root of beatitude;
        however each man ought to love himself in charity in order that he may
        share in beatitude. He should also love his neighbor as his associate in
        the participation of beatitude, and his own body according as beatitude
        redounds to it.</a

        >But in the second way, i.e., considered as those goods which we wish
        for others are said to be loved, everything can be loved out of charity
        insofar as these are goods of those who are able to enjoy beatitude.
        For, all creatures are a means for man to tend towards his beatitude,
        and, further, all creatures are ordered to the glory of God inasmuch as
        the divine goodness is manifested in them. At this time, therefore, we
        can love all things out of charity, but only by ordering them to those
        beings which have, or can have, beatitude.</a

        >Now it must also be considered that loves are related to one another in
        accord with the relation among goods which are their objects.
        Accordingly, since all human goods are ordered to eternal beatitude as
        the ultimate end, the love of charity includes within itself all human
        loves, with the exception of those which are based on sin, which cannot
        be ordered to beatitude. Whence, that some who are relatives, or
        fellow-citizens, or fellow pilgrims, or any such, should love (diligant)
        one another, can be meritorious and out of charity; but that some be
        bound together (ament se invicem) for the sake of sharing in robbery or
        adultery, this cannot be meritorious nor out of charity.</a

        life of nature as regards our species, but only as regards the genus of
        rational nature; but we are able to share with them in the life of
        glory. As to that which is said (Matt. xxv. 15), To every one He gave
        according to his proper ability, this must not be referred only to
        natural ability, for it is erroneous to say that the gifts of grace and
        glory are given according to natural measure, but rather here [in this
        text] must be understood also that ability which is by way of grace,
        through which it is granted to men that they can merit glory equal to
        that of the angels.</a

        aid to the law of nature, which had been obscured by sin. But the law
        was not rendered so obscure that it would not move one to love, so that
        man would not love himself or his body; but it was obscured to this
        extent that it was not moving man to love God and his neighbor.
        Therefore, in the written law, there had to be given precepts about
        loving God and neighbor, in which is, nevertheless, also included the
        precept that each one love himself. The reason for this is that as we
        are induced to love God, we are induced to desire Him, by which we
        especially love ourselves and wish for ourselves the highest good. But
        in the precept of loving neighbor, it is said, Love your neighbor as
        yourself. In this is included the love of self.</a

        feelings that constitute friendship for others are an extension of
        regard for self. But as charity signifies love, thus is one able to love
        himself in charity. But Gregory speaks of charity considered as it

        Reproach, indeed, does not pertain to spiritual goods because no one is
        able to love virtue too much. But one can love himself to excess

        able to love out of charity, but it does follow that he is not able to
        judge whether he loves out of charity. Thus, it can be required of us
        that we love out of charity, but not that we judge that we are loving
        out of charity. Whence the Apostle says (1 Cor. iv. 3), Neither do I
        judge my own self... but he that judgeth me, is the Lord.</a

        whence it is written (1 Tim. i. 5), The end of the commandment is
        charity, because the love of God is the goal in observing the precepts.

        a habit tending toward loving, being related to the act of loving as
        heat is to heating. In the reationship of formal cause, however,

        >1. That which comes under a precept is not from the perfection of a
        counsel. But to love one's enemies comes under this precept, viz., Love
        your neighbor as yourself, for by the word neighbor is understood all
        men, as Augustine says in the <i>De Doctrina Christiana</i>. Therefore
        to love one's enemies is not from the perfection of a counsel.</a

        perfection of a counsel, at least to the extent of displaying
        acquaintance and the other effects of charity. On the contrary, we are
        bound to love all men in charity. But the love of charity is not only in
        the heart but also in works, for it is said (1 John iii. 18), Let us not
        love in word, nor in tongue, but in deed, and in truth. Therefore,
        considered as the effect of charity, love of enemy comes under a
        precept.</a

      <a name="8" id="8"
        >3. Moreover, it is also written (Matt. v. 44), Love your enemies, do
        good to them that hate you. If, therefore, to love your enemy is from a
        precept, then to do good to him, which pertains to the effect of
        charity, is also from a precept.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="8" id="8"
        >4. Moreover, those things which pertain to the perfection of the
        counsels were not written in the Old Law, as is said (Hebr. vii. 19),
        The law brought nothing to perfection. But in the Old Law, it was taught
        that not only the affection of love be had for enemies, but also that
        the effect of love be imparted to them. For, it is written (Exod.,
        xxiii. 4), If thou meet thy enemy's ox or ass going astray, bring it
        back to him; (Levit. xix. 17), Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy
        heart, but reprove him openly, lest thou incur sin through him; (Job
        xxxi. 29, 30), If I have been glad at the downfall of him that hated me,
        and have re/oiced that evil had found him. For I have not given my mouth
        to sin; (Prov. xxv. 21), If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he
        thirst give him water to drink. Therefore the love of enemies, insofar
        as it shows the effects of charity, is not from the perfection of a
        counsel.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="8" id="8"
        >5. Moreover, a counsel is not contrary to a precept of the law. For the
        Lord, when He was about to teach the perfection of the New Law, first
        said (Malt. v. 17), I am not come to destroy the law but to fulfill it.
        But to love enemies seems to be contrary to the precept of the law, for
        it is said (Matt. v. 43), Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy
        enemy. Therefore the love of enemies does not come under the perfection
        of a counsel.</a

    <p>
      <a name="8" id="8"
        >6. Moreover, love has its proper object toward which it inclines, as
        Augustine says, My weight is my love. An enemy does not seem to be the
        proper object of love, but rather he seems to be one resisting love.
        Therefore it is not of the perfection of charity that an enemy should be

        inclination of nature; rather, through virtue the inclination of nature
        is perfected. But it is nature that moves us to hate our enemies, for
        every natural being rejects its own contrary. Therefore it is not of the
        perfection of charity that an enemy should be loved.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="8" id="8"
        >8. Moreover, the perfection of charity, and of any virtue, consists in
        our becoming like to God. But God loves His friends and hates His
        enemies, according to the text (Malac. i. 2), I have loved Jacob, but
        have hated Esau. Therefore it is not of the perfection of charity that
        someone should love his enemies, but rather he should hate them.</a

    <p>
      <a name="8" id="8"

        life. But we ought not to wish the good of eternal life for some of our
        enemies; for, either they have been condemned to hell, or if they are
        still living, they have been rejected by God. Therefore to love enemies
        does not pertain to the perfection of charity.</a

        charity, nor can we wish his death or any other evil for him, because
        the meaning of friendship is that we wish to be friends and to live. But
        it is lawful for us to kill some, for, according to the Apostle (Rom.
        xiii. 4), For he is God's minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him
        that doth evil. Therefore we are not bound to love our enemies.</a

    <p>
      <a name="8" id="8"

        case of contraries the argument runs as follows. If to love your friends
        and to do good for them is a good thing, then to love your enemies and
        to do good for them is an evil thing. But no evil attains to the
        perfection of charity, nor is it included under a counsel. Therefore to
        love your enemies does not pertain to the perfection of a counsel.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="8" id="8"
        >12. Moreover, friend and enemy are contraries. Therefore both to love a
        friend and to hate an enemy are contraries. But contraries cannot exist
        together. Therefore, since we are bound to love our friends in charity,
        it cannot be a counsel that we love our enemies.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="8" id="8"
        >13. Moreover, a counsel cannot be concerned with the impossible. But to
        love an enemy seems to be impossible, since it is contrary to the
        inclination of nature. Therefore to love our enemies is not a
        counsel.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="8" id="8"
        >14. Moreover, to obey the counsels is for the perfect. The Apostles
        were perfect to a high degree, but they did not love their enemies both
        with regard to affection and deed. For it was written of St. Thomas the
        Apostle that he called down upon the one who struck him with an open
        hand, a curse such that his hand was snatched off by hungry dogs.
        Therefore to love enemies both as regards affection and deed does not
        come under the perfection of a counsel.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="8" id="8"
        >15. Moreover, to call down evils on anyone, especially the evil of
        eternal damnation, is opposed to love both as regards affection and
        deed. But the Prophets called down evils for their adversaries, for it
        is said (Psalms lxviii. 29), Let them be blotted out of the book of the
        living; and with the just let them not be written. And again, (Psalms
        liv. 16), Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into
        hell. Therefore to love enemies does not come under the perfection of
        charity. 16. Moreover, it is of the very nature of true friendship that
        someone be loved for his own sake; but charity includes friendship, as
        the perfect includes the less perfect. But to love one's enemy for his
        own sake is contrary to charity, for only God is loved for His own sake.
        Therefore it is not from the perfection of a counsel that our enemy is
        loved.</a

        and more meritorious than that which is from the necessity of a precept.
        But to love an enemy is neither better nor more meritorious than to love
        a friend, which clearly is from the necessity of a precept; for, if it
        is good to love something good, it is better and more meritorious to
        love what is better. But a friend is better than an enemy. Therefore to
        love an enemy is not from the perfection of a counsel.</a

      <a name="8" id="8"

        it is more difficult. On the contrary, to love an enemy is more
        difficult than to love God. Therefore, by the same reasoning, it should
        be more meritorious to love an enemy than to love God.</a

        >To prove this, it must be known that, as has been said above in Article
        IV of this Question, the proper and essential object of charity is God;
        and whatever is loved in charity is loved in terms of that very
        relationship by which it is related to God. For example, just as if we
        love some man, we consequently love everything with whom he is
        concerned, even if they are our own enemies. But it is agreed that all
        men are related to God as created by Him and as capable of a happiness
        which consists in the enjoyment of Him. It is clear, therefore, that
        this meaningful basis of the love that charity involves is found in all
        men.</a

      <a name="8" id="8"
        >Therefore, in one who acts unfriendly toward us, two things are to be
        considered: one which is the basis of love, viz., in that he is related
        to God; and another which is the basis of hate, viz., in that he is our
        adversary. However, if in anyone is tound both the basis of love and of
        hate, and if love is neglected and we turn in the direction of hate, it
        is clear that the basis of hate predominates in our heart over the basis
        of love. Thus, therefore, if one regards his enemy with hatred, his
        enmity toward him predominates in his heart over divine love. Therefore
        he hates the friendship with such a one more than he loves God. But we
        hate something to the degree that we love the good of which we are
        deprived by the enemy. Therefore it remains that whoever hates his enemy
        loves some created good more than he loves God; and this is against the
        precept of charity. But to regard your enemy with hatred is against
        charity, for it is necessary, if we are bound by the precept of charity,
        that the love of God predominate in us over the love of any other thing
        and, as a consequence, also over the hatred of the contrary of that
        thing. Therefore it follows that we are bound to love our enemies out of
        the necessity of a precept.</a

        to love our neighbor, the precept does not extend to this that we should
        actually love each and every neighbor in particular or do well by each
        one in a particular way, because no man is capable of having all men in
        mind in such a way that he would actually love each one in a particular
        way, nor is there any one capable of doing good or helping each and
        every one in a particular way.</a

        friendship, for all other lawful loves are included under charity, as
        was said above. Whence Augustine says, You cannot do good to all men,
        you are to pay special regard to those who, by the accidents of time, or
        place, or circumstance, are brought into closer connection with you...
        You must take the matter as decided for you by a sort of lot, according

        other bond, except to him united to us by the chance bond of location or
        of time, and especially if we would see him in some necessity through
        which he would not be able to be helped except by us. We are bound,
        however, by the affection and the carrying out of the works of charity,
        by which we love all our neighbors and pray for them, not to exclude
        even those who are not joined to us by any special bond, as for instance

        charity, we are bound by the obligation of precept to love them in
        common, both with affection and deed, and individually when the moment
        of need threatens. But when man for the sake of God shows toward his
        enemies that special affection and deeds of love which he devotes to
        those who are joined to him, this is perfect charity and follows from a
        counsel. For, it arises from the perfection of charity that charity
        alone should so move one toward an enemy in the manner that both charity
        and particular iove move one toward a friend. It is evident, however,
        that the fact that the action of an agent attains to that which is
        distant is due to the perfection of its active power. For the power of
        fire is more perfect when not only things nearby but also those distant
        are heated. So also that charity is more perfect through which one is
        moved, both in loving and in doing good, toward not only neighbors but
        also foreigners, and beyond this even to enemies, not only in general
        but in particular.</a

        the inclination of nature ought not to be taken away. Therefore charity,

        of God in which the divine justice is manifested. In this manner does
        God love them. But we ought to wish those who are not yet known to be

        charity. For, Gregory says in one of his Homilies that the just, while
        still loving, may cause a persecution; for if outwardly they create
        unrest by disciplining, inwardly, however, they may preserve their
        serenity by charity. Now we can desire or cause some temporal evil for
        those whom we love in charity for three reasons: first, we can do it in
        order to correct them; secondly, it may be because the temporal
        prosperity of some is detrimental to the good of some multitude or even
        the whole Church, whence Gregory writes in XXII <i>Moral.</i> It often
        happens that the ruin of our enemy can make us happy without our losing
        charity, and again, his glory can sadden us without incurring the fault
        of envy. This happens when, by his downfall, we believe that some are
        profited more, or when, by his advantage, we fear that many will be
        unjustly oppressed. Thirdly, our motive may be in order to preserve the
        order of divine justice, according as it is written (Psalms lvii. 11),
        The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge.</a

        that we love him for whom we wish some good, as is proper to a
        friendship for a noble person; but not as the good which we wish for
        ourselves, as is proper to a friendship for a pleasant or useful person,
        in which we love a friend as our own good. For, it is not that we seek
        pleasure or utility for a friend, but that we seek pleasure or utility
        for ourselves from a friend; just as we also love things pleasing and
        useful for ourselves, such as food or clothing. But when we love one out
        of virtue, we wish good for him, and we do not wish him for ourselves;
        this is especially proper to the friendship of charity.</a

        than to love only a friend, because this shows more perfect charity, as
        was said above in the body of the Article. But if we consider these two
        absolutely, it is better to love a friend than an enemy; it is also
        better to love God than a friend. For, the difficulty which is found in
        loving an enemy does not constitute the reason for meriting, except
        insofar as perfect charity is demonstrated by it, which overcomes the
        difficulty. Thus, if there would be such a perfect charity as to take
        away all difficulty, to this extent it would be more meritorious. But we
        speak of one who loves a friend with such perfect charity that it even
        extends to the love of enemies; but this love operates with more ardor
        toward the friend, unless by chance it is considered accidentally
        insofar as it operates against something repugnant with a greater
        effort. For example, in natural things, water that is warm is with

        life we should love the best more than those who are closest to us. This

        ecclesiastical benefices. Therefore it does not seem that one's

        commander than to his father. And he must must be more generous to a

        with more blame. But it seems that the friendship of those friends whom
        we freely choose is more culpably broken off than that of our relatives
        who are given to us, not of our own choice, but by a chance of nature.
        Therefore other friends ought to be loved more than our own
        relatives.</a

        more, then since a wife who is one in flesh is closer, or children who
        are a part of the parent are closer than the parents are, it seems that
        children or a wife ought to be loved more than parents." Therefore
        parents should not be loved most. Thus there does not seem to be that

        do with the effects of love, and not with the loving itself; and they
        were influenced by the words of Augustine, who writes that all men ought
        to be loved equally, but since you cannot do good to all, you are to pay
        special regard to those who, by the accidents of time, or place, or
        circumstance, are brought into closer connection with you.</a

        >But this seems to be an unreasonable position, for God so provides for
        each man according as his state in life requires. Thus love and a desire
        for the end are implanted by God in those things which tend toward the
        end of their nature, according as each one's individual state demands
        that it tend toward its end. Therefore in these things there is a
        stronger movement according to nature toward a certain end, and there is
        also in them a greater inclination, which is the natural appetite; as
        can be seen in heavy and light objects. But, just as the appetite or
        natural love is a certain inclination implanted in natural things to
        ends which are connatural to them, so the love of charity is a certain.
        inclination infused in rational nature for the purpose of tending toward
        God. Therefore, according as it is necessary for one to tend toward God,
        thus is he inclined out of charity.</a

        especially needed is that there be divine help; secondly, that there be
        some self-help; and thirdly, that there be cooperation with fellow-men.
        And in this we see a gradation, for some cooperate only in a general
        way, while others who are more closely united cooperate in a special
        way. Not all are able to cooperate in a special way. Our body and those
        things which are necessary for the body also help us tend toward God,

        fellow-men, he ought to give mutual help to those who are more closely

        his father, and mother,... he cannot be my disciple. Finally, we ought
        to love our body. Thus, regarding the act which charity evokes, an order
        ought to be established according to the affection in the love of

        are also able to be ordered to charity. Thus, the charity of these loves
        can command an act; and therefore that which is loved more according to
        some of these loves is loved more out of that charity which commands the
        act. It is also clear that, according to natural love, our relatives are
        more loved in affection; according to a social love, those who are
        closely united to us are loved more; and so for all the other kinds of
        love. Therefore it is also evident that in affection, one neighbor ought
        to be loved more than another; and he is loved out of a charity which
        commands the act of the other lawful friendships.</a

        thing, and if truth is considered according to the characteristic of
        equality which does not allow a greater or less degree, it does not then
        happen that a thing is more or less true. But if the being itself of the
        thing is considered, which is the basis of truth, as is said in II
        <i>Metaphys.</i>, then the disposition of things in being and in truth
        is the same. Thus, those things which are more in being are more true,
        and because of this, principles in scientific demonstrations are
        believed more than conclusions. And thus it happens also in regard to
        those things which concern faith. In this way the Apostle (1 Cor. xv)

        which is obtained from others. And thus it is not always those who live

        one loves himself, he loves his wife and children more than his parents

        Therefore the love which one has for his wife and son is more included
        in the love by which a person loves himself than is the love which he
        has for his parents. But this is not to love the son for the son's sake,
        but rather for one's own sake. But according to the mode of love by
        which we love another for the other's sake, a father ought to be loved
        more than a son insofar as we receive greater benefit from the father,
        and also insofar as the honor of the son depends more on the honor of
        the father than vice versa. Therefore in a display of reverence, in
        obedience, in doing the will of another, and in other similar things,
        man is bound more to his father than to his son. But in providing the
        necessities, he is bound more to the child than to the parent, because
        parents ought to lay away treasures for their children and not vice
        versa, as is said in 1 Corinth., iv.</a

      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="10" id="10"
        ><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that the perfect is spoken of in three
        ways: first, the perfect in itself; secondly, the perfect according to
        nature; and thirdly, the perfect according to time. A thing is called
        perfect in itself when it is perfect in every respect and when no
        perfection is lacking. Something is called perfect according to nature
        when it lacks none of the things which it should possess by its very
        nature. For example, we say that the intellect of man is perfect, not
        because it lacks none of the intelligibles, but rather because it lacks
        none of those things through which man naturally knows. We say a thing
        is perfect according to time when nothing is lacking to it of those
        things which it is born to have according to a particular time, as we
        call a boy perfect because he possesses everything that is required for
        a human being of that age. So it must be said that charity which is
        perfect without any qualification is possessed by God alone. But charity
        which is perfect according to nature can be had by man, but not in this
        life. Charity which is perfect according to time can be had even in this
        life. To understand this clearly, it should be known that since act and
        habit are specified by their object, it is necessary that any reason of
        their perfection arise from this same object. But the object of charity
        is the highest good. Therefore charity is perfect without qualffication
        not only when it is directed to the highest good, but in the same degree
        as that good is good. Therefore since the highest good is infinite, it
        is to be loved infinitely. Whence no created charity, since it is
        finite, can be perfect without qualffication, but only the love of God
        by which He loves Himself can be called perfect in this way.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="10" id="10"
        >However, according to the nature of a rational creature, charity is
        said to be perfect when the rational creature is turned to loving God as
        much as he is able to love Him. But man is impeded in this life, so that
        his mind is not directed completely to God, for three reasons. The first
        reason is the contrary inclination of the soul, for when the soul is
        turned by sin toward a changeable good as toward an end, it is directed
        away from the immutable good. Secondly, man does not completely love God
        because of his occupation with the affairs of the world; for, as the
        Apostle says (1 Cor. vii. 33), He that is with a wife, is solicitous for
        the things of the world, how he may please his wife; and he is divided;
        i.e., his heart is not directed only to God. The third reason is from
        the infirmity of this present life, with the necessities with which man
        must be occupied to a certain extent, and his soul must be diverted from
        being directed to God perfectly, e.g., sleeping, eating, and doing other
        things of this kind without which the present life could not be lived.
        Further, the soul is weighted down by the burden of the body so that it
        cannot see the divine light in its essence.14 By such a vision, charity
        would be per fected, according as the Apostle says (1I Cor. v. 6-7),
        While we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord. (For we walk by
        faith, and not by sight.)</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="10" id="10"
        >However, man can live in this life without turning himself away from
        God by mortal sin. Again, he is able to live without the occupation of
        temporal affairs, as is said (1 Cor. vii. 32), He that is without a
        wife, is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may
        please God. However, man cannot be free from the burden of his
        corruptible body in this life. Thus, according as the first two
        impediments are removed, charity can be perfect in this life; but not as
        regards the third. Therefore no one can possess in this life the perfect
        charity he will have in the next life, unless he be at one and the same
        time a traveler here below and a beholder of God, and this is proper
        only to Christ.</a

        according to which the totality excludes everything that prevents a
        perfect adherence to God; and this is not a precept but the end of a

        we should tend toward it, as Augustine says.</a

        in a thing according to its species is found in it always; just as man,
        because of his rational soul, is perfect at any time or at any age.
        Whence, the perfection of charity which is according to all time is the
        perfection which is found in charity according to its species. But it is
        of the very essence of charity that God be loved above all things and
        that no creature be preferred to Him in love. Whence, since every
        temptation occurs from the love of some created good, or from the fear
        of a contrary evil which is derived from love, charity, in whatever
        degree, has from its species that it is able to resist any temptation in
        such way that man is not led into mortal sin through it, not however
        that man is affected in no way by temptation; for this pertains to the
        perfection of heaven.</a

        regarded on the part of the one who loves and the one who sees, for the
        entire power of the creature will be applied to seeing and loving God.
        Likewise, it can also be understood that God will be wholly seen and
        loved because there is no part of Him which is not seen and loved, since
        He is not composite but simple. But according to another way of
        understanding this, He is not wholly loved or seen, because He will not
        be seen or loved by any creature to the degree that He can be seen or is
        lovable. In this life, however, God cannot even be wholly seen or loved
        according to the first or second way, for He is not seen through His
        essence, nor is it possible for man living in this life that his
        affective power be perfectly directed toward God without any
        interruption. Nevertheless, God is wholly loved in some way by man in
        this life according as there is nothing in his affective power contrary
        to the divine love.</a

        that what is always actually directed toward God is lovable on the part

        contrary, the precepts of the law concern the acts of the virtues; but a

        text (Matt. v. 20), Unless your justice abound more than that of the
        Scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.
        But everyone is bound to do those things which concern the necessity of
        salvation, and they are therefore bound to accomplish this fulfillment.
        But this aforesaid fulfillment pertains to perfection, for the Lord

        follow that he who is poorer is more perfect; so, too, a counsel of
        virginity is given, and yet many virgins are less perfect in charity
        than others. Thus it seems that the perfection of charity is not
        referred to the counsels. Therefore no one is excused from the

        the state of a religious to that of a prelate. Thus, Dionysius says in
        the <i>Eccles. Hierarchia</i>, that bishops are more perfect, but monks
        are more perfectly resigned in their virtues; and they ought to elevate
        themselves to that perfection which they observe in bishops. However,

        of charity, viz., that which consists in removing any inclination toward
        the contrary of charity. But another perfection, without which charity
        can exist, is that which pertains to the well-being of charity, viz.,
        that which consists in the taking away of the occupations of the world
        by which human affection is hindered from freely advancing to God. But
        there is another kind of perfection of charity which is not possible for
        man in this life; and another which no created nature can attain. This

        >To the second, it must be said that to order all things actually to God
        is not possible in this life; just as it is not possible to be always
        thinking of God, for this pertains to the perfection of heaven. But that
        all things be ordered to God by virtue does pertain to the perfection of
        charity, to which all are bound. To prove this, it must be understood
        that just as in efficient causes the power of the primary cause remains
        in all the subsequent causes, so also does the intention of the
        principal end virtually remain in all the secondary ends. Thus, whoever
        actually intends some secondary end, virtually intends the primary end.
        For example, a physician, while actually gathering herbs, intends the
        end of preparing a prescription, while perhaps not thinking about
        health; yirtually, however, he intends health as the end for which he
        administers the prescription. In the same way, he who orders himself to
        God as to an end, in all things which he does for his own sake, the
        intention of the final end which is God remains virtually. Thus he is
        able to gain merit in all things if he has charity. It is in this
        manner, therefore, that the Apostle wrote that everything should be
        ordered to the glory of God.</a

    <p>
      <a name=""
        >To the third, it must be said that it is one thing to order things to
        God habitually and another thing to do so virtually. For, habitually one
        orders to God who does nothing, nor does he actually intend anything, as
        sleeping. But to order something to God virtually is the act of an agent
        ordering to God because of the end. Therefore to order to God habitually
        does not come under a precept, but to do so virtually does come from a
        precept since this is nothing other than to have God as the ultimate
        end.</a

    <p>
      <a name=""
        >To the fifth, it must be said that the perfection of eternal life
        consists principally and essentially in certain things, but secondarily
        and accidentally it consists in others. Principally and essentially,
        this perfection consists in those things which pertain to an interior
        disposition of the mind, and especially in the act of charity which is
        the root of all the virtues. But secondarily and accidentally, this
        perfection also consists in certain external things, such as virginity,
        poverty, and other such things. These things are said to pertain to
        perfection in a threefold manner. They pertain to perfection, first,
        insofar as through them the hindrances of the manifold activities of
        ordinary life are taken away from man, and when they are removed, the
        mind is more freely directed to God. Thus the Lord, when He said (Matt.
        xix. 21), If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give it
        to the poor, He then added, and come follow me. He did this to show that
        poverty does not pertain to perfection unless it dispose one to follow
        Christ. For, we follow Him not with the movements of our body, but with
        the affections of the soul. In this way, the Apostle gave counsel about
        not marrying (1 Cor. vii. 34), for she who is a virgin thinkest on the
        things of the Lord, how to please Him. And this same reasoning concerns
        similar cases.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name=""
        >Secondly, they pertain to perfection insofar as they are the effects of
        perfect charity; for he who loves God perfectly removes himself from
        those things which can prevent him from devoting himself to God.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name=""
        >Thirdly, they pertain to the perfection of penance, for no satisfaction
        for sin can be equal to religious vows by which man consecrates himself
        to God; his soul through the vow of obedience, his body through the vow
        of chastity, and all other things through the vow of poverty. Therefore,
        in regard to those things which primarily and essentially pertain to
        perfection, it follows that there will be a greater perfection where
        those things are found in more abundance; just as he who has more
        charity is more perfect. But with regard to those things which pertain
        to perfection as a consequent or accidentally, it does not follow that
        perfection in itself is greater where they are found in greater
        abundance. Therefore it does not follow that he who is poorer is more
        perfect. However, perfection in such matters ought to be measured by a
        comparison to those things in which perfection essentially consists. For
        example, he is said to be more perfect whose poverty separates him the
        more from earthly occupations and makes him freer in devoting himself to
        God.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name=""
        >To the sixth, it must be said that there is a difference between a
        friendship for a noble person and a friendship for a pleasant person,
        because in a friendship for a pleasant person, the friend is loved for
        the sake of pleasure; but in a friendship for a noble person, the friend
        is loved for his own sake, although pleasure is a result of this.
        Therefore it is proper to the perfection of a friendship for a noble
        person that one who is occupied in serving a friend should sometimes
        even abstain from a pleasure which he experiences in the friend's
        presence for the sake of that friend. So, according to this friendship,
        he who would absent himself from a friend for the friend's sake would
        love him more than he who would not wish to depart from the presence of
        that friend even for that friend's sake. But if anyone be willingly and
        easily deprived of the friend's presence and be more pleased with other
        things, this proves that he loves the friend either not at all, or only
        a little. We can, therefore, consider these three grades in charity, but
        God ought to be most especially loved for His own sake. For, there are
        some who freely, or without great vexation, are separated from the
        leisure of divine contemplation so that they are concerned with earthly
        affairs, and in these there is apparent either no charity, or very
        little. Some, however, so delight in the leisure of divine contemplation
        that they do not want to turn away from it even to apply their service
        to God to the salvation of their fellowmen. The highest degree, the
        third, are those who rise to the heights of charity so that even as they
        advance in divine contemplation, although they are very much delighted
        in it, serve God in order to save their fellowmen. This is the
        perfection meant by St. Paul (Rom. ix. 3), For I wished myself to be an
        anathema from Christ, i.e., separated from Him, for my brethren; and
        (Philip. i. 23-24), I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ,...
        But to abide still in the flesh, is needful for you. This is the
        perfection proper to prelates, preachers, and all the other religious
        whose life is dedicated to looking after the salvation of others. This
        is what is meant by the angels on the ladder, in Jacob's dream,
        ascending through contemplation, but descending through the
        responsibility which they bear over the salvation of their neighbor
        (Gen. xxviii. 11-12). The status of church dignitaries, however, cannot
        become less perfect because of some who misuse this state and seek that
        position for the sake of temporal goods, as if not attracted to the
        delightfulness of contemplation; just as the disbelief of many does not
        destroy faith in God, as is said (Rom. iii. 27).</a

        >To the seventh, it must be said that in the teaching of the Gospels,
        certain things are said to the Apostles in the person of all the
        faithful, viz., those things which pertain to the necessity of
        salvation. Thus, it is written (Mark xiii. 37), What I say to you, I say
        to all: watch. By watch is meant that solicitude which man ought to have
        so that he will not be found unprepared by Christ. But other things are
        said to the Apostles which concern the perfection of this life and the
        duties of prelates, and these cannot be included in, What I say to you,
        I say to all. However, it should be understood that what the Lord said
        to His disciples (Luke ix. 3), Take nothing for your journey, etc., as
        Augustine has explained in the <i>De Consen. Evangelist.</i>, does not
        pertain to the perfection of life but to the power of apostolic dignity,
        through which the Apostles, while carrying nothing with them, were able
        to live on that which was provided for them by those to whom they
        preached the Gospel. Thus it was written in the same place (Luke x. 7),
        The labourer is worthy of his hire, i.e., of his food; but this was
        neither a precept nor a counsel, but a concession. Because of this, St.
        Paul who carried his necessities about with him, not using this
        concession, paid over and above, as if striving against his own wages.
        This is clear from 1 Cor. ix. 7.</a

        >To the eighth, it must be said that there are two affections in man;
        the one of charity by which the soul desires to be with Christ; the
        other, however, a natural affection by which the soul resists the
        separation from the body—which is natural to man; for not even was the
        old man taken away from Peter, as Augustine says in
        <i>Super Joan. 2</i>. Thus, by uniting these two affections, the soul
        wishes to be united in such a way to God so that it would not be
        separated from the body. For this reason, the Apostle wrote (1I Cor. v.
        4), We would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is
        mortal may be swallowed up by life. But since this is impossible, While
        we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord (2 Cor. v. 6),
        opposition arises among these mentioned affections, and the more perfect
        charity is, the more does the affection of charity sensibly overcome the
        affection of nature. This pertains to the perfection of charity. Whence
        the Apostle adds (1I Cor. v. 8), But we are confident, and have a good
        will to be absent rather from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
        But in those in whom charity is imperfect, if only the affection of
        charity conquers, then from the repugnance of the natural affection, the
        victory of charity is rendered imperceptible. Therefore the Apostle
        clearly, unhesitatingly, and even boldly said, I desire to be dissolved
        and to be with Christ (Philip. i. 23); this is perfect charity. It is
        from the necessity of charity that the soul prefers in any way, even
        imperceptibly, the enjoyment of God to the union with the body.</a

        >To the ninth, it must be said that to give up your life, i.e., this
        present life for your brother is, in one way, from the necessity of
        charity, and in another way from the perfection of it. For, man ought to
        love his neighbor more than his own body. Therefore, in the case where
        one is bound to look after the salvation of his neighbor, he is also
        bound to expose his bodily life to dangers for the sake of that
        salvation. But this is perfect charity, that he also expose his bodily
        life to dangers for those to whom he is not bound as to a neighbor.</a

        sin.</a

        parents, and even more to God, all that he can. But according to the
        common mode of human life, no one is bound from the necessity of a
        precept to give more than he is able.</a

        but some promise a state of perfection which consists in those things
        which are ordered as means to the perfection of charity, such as poverty
        or fastings. They are not bound to all things of this kind, but only to
        those which they promise. Thus, the perfection of charity does not
        accrue to them by their vows, but it is as an end to which they attempt
        to arrive by means of what they vow.</a

        of God. But only the sons of God have charity, for this distinguishes
        the children of God's kingdom from the children of perdition, as

        sin, as Augustine says, Charity is an invisible unction which will be
        the foundation wherever it is and which cannot wither away; it is
        nourished by the heat of the sun so that it does not dry up.3 Therefore

        love is not true it ought not to be called love. But, as he also says in
        <i>Ad Julianum Comitem</i>, charity which is able to be lost was never
        true. Thus it was not charity. Therefore he who has charity cannot lose

        right will inseparably united to God, free from any defilement, not
        knowing corruption, not liable to the fault of change; for when it is
        possessed, one neither was able, nor will he be able to sin. Therefore
        charity, once possessed, cannot be lost through sin.</a

      <a name="12" id="12"
        >7. Moreover, free will does not incline toward sin unless it be through
        something that moves to sinning. But that which moves to every sin is
        self-love, which, as Augustine says in Book XIV of the
        <i>De Civit. Dei</i>, caused the city of Babylon. But charity does not
        allow this, as Dionysius says, Divine love causes rapture, not allowing
        men to be' lovers of self. Likewise, the desire of money is the root of
        all evils, as St. Paul says (1 Tim. vi. 10). But neither does charity
        allow this, as Augustine says in the <i>LXXXIII Quaestionum</i>.
        Therefore he who has charity cannot lose it by sinning.</a

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="12" id="12"

        according to this, If you are led by the spirit, you are not under the
        law (Galat. v. 18). But the Holy Spirit, since He is of infinite power,
        cannot fail in His action. Therefore it seems that one having charity
        cannot sin.</a

        Philosopher says in Book VII of the <i>Ethics</i>, one does not sin
        against science in its actual state, but only against science in its
        habitual state. But charity is always in operation, for Gregory says in
        one of his <i>Homilies</i>, the love of God is never idle. Therefore one
        cannot sin against charity so that it can in this way be lost by sin.</a

        possessing it or while he is not possessing it. But while he has it, he
        does not lose it through sin, because sin would then exist along with
        charity. Nor does he lose it when he does not have it, because he cannot
        lose what he does not have. Therefore in no way can charity be lost.</a

      <a name="12" id="12"
        >11. Moreover, charity is a sort of accident in the soul. But accidents
        can fail in four ways. The first way is through the corruption of the
        subject. But charity is not deficient in this way because the human
        soul, which is its subject, is incorruptible. An accident fails in the
        second way through a defect of cause, as light fails in the air through
        an absence of the sun. But charity cannot fail in this way because its
        cause, which is God, is unfailing. An accident fails in a third way by a
        deficiency of its object, as paternity ceases through the death of a
        child. But neither is charity deficient in this way, because its object
        is the eternal good, which is God. In the fourth way, an accident fails
        through the action of its contrary agent, as the cold quality of water
        fails through the action of heat. But charity does not fail in this way
        because it is stronger than sin which is the agent acting against it,
        according to this (Cantic. viii. 6), Love is strong as death; and (Cant.
        viii. 7), Many waters cannot quench charity. Therefore charity can in no
        way fail in one who possesses it.</a

    <p>
      <a name="12" id="12"
        >12. Moreover, for rational nature, sin is in the class of evil. But
        evil does not act except in virtue of the good, as Dionysius says in
        chap. IV of the <i>De Divinis Nominibus</i>: But one good is not
        contrary to another, as is said in the <i>Praedicamentis</i>; and thus
        one good cannot destroy another, because each thing is destroyed by its
        contrary. Therefore charity cannot be destroyed by sin.</a

      <a name="12" id="12"

        existing sin or by non-existing sin. But it cannot be destroyed by
        existing sin, for then mortal sin would be existing along with charity.
        Again, it cannot be destroyed by non-existing sin, because non-being
        cannot act. Therefore charity cannot be lost by sin in any way.</a

        soul either at the same moment or at different moments. They cannot
        exist at the same moment, because then they would exist together. Nor
        can charity exist at one instant, and sin at another; because it would
        then be necessary that there be a medium time during which man has
        neither charity nor sin, which cannot happen. Therefore charity cannot
        be lost through sin.</a

        truth, so is the will related to the love of the good. But the
        intellect, by knowing anything whatever, knows the first truth.
        Therefore by loving anything good, the will loves the greatest good. But
        he who loves never sins unless he turn himself by his love to a mutable
        good. Therefore in every sin man loves the highest good, the love of
        which is charity. Therefore charity can never be lost by sin.</a

        genus of efficient cause, so also is there in the genus of final cause.
        But the proper agent always acts in virtue of the universal agent.
        Therefore the proper end always moves the will in virtue of the final
        end. But the final end is God. Thus the same argument as above
        follows.</a

    <p>
      <a name="12" id="12"

        Christ, according to this (John xiii. 35), By this shall all men know
        that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another. But he is
        not a true disciple of Christ who is not always His disciple, as
        Augustine says. In explaining this text (John vi. 67), After this many
        of His disciples turned back, Augustine says that they were not true
        disciples of Christ; and the Lord said (John viii. 31), If you abide in
        my word, you shall be my disciples indeed. Therefore he who does not
        remain in charity never had charity.</a

        it. But charity is the ruler of the heart of the one who has charity,
        for it seizes the entire heart for itself, as is commanded (Deut. vi.
        5), Love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart. Therefore the movement
        of the one who has charity follows according to charity; thus charity
        cannot be lost through sin.</a

        together as the same in number. But corruptible and incorruptible are of
        different genera, as is said in Book X of the <i>Metaphysics</i>.
        Therefore, since the charity of this life and the charity of heaven are
        the same in number, it seems that just as the charity of heaven cannot
        be destroyed, neither can the charity of this life.</a

        something or in nothing. But it is not destroyed in something, because
        this concerns only form which is educed from the potency of matter. It
        cannot be destroyed in nothing, because God Who alone is able to make
        nothing out of something, just as He alone is able to make something out
        of nothing, never destroys charity. Both are equally far apart.
        Therefore it seems that charity cannot be lost.</a

        God Who is the giver of charity cannot be restrained. Therefore charity
        cannot be taken away by sin.</a

        spouse, according to a kind of spiritual marriage. But a bodily marriage
        cannot be dissolved by any disagreement that overshadows the marriage.
        Therefore charity cannot be taken away by sin, in which the soul
        disagrees with those things which pertain to God.</a

        we love the brethren. But natural life can be lost through natural
        death. Therefore the life of charity can also be lost through the death
        of mortal sin.</a

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="12" id="12"
        ><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that the Master wrote in Book I, dist.
        17,24 that the charity in us is the Holy Spirit. But his intention was
        not to say that the very act of our love is the Holy Spirit, but rather
        that the Holy Spirit moves our soul to love God and neighbor; just as He
        moves our soul to the acts of the other virtues. But to the act of the
        other virtues, He moves the soul through certain habits of infused
        virtues, whereas to the act of love for God and neighbor He moves the
        soul without any habitual medium. Therefore, Peter's opinion was indeed
        true insofar as he maintained that the soul is moved by the Holy Spirit
        to love God and neighbor. However, it was imperfect in this respect that
        he did not posit in us a certain created habit by which the human will
        is perfected to the act of this kind of love. For, it is necessary that
        a habit of this kind be found in the soul, as was said above in Article
        I of this Question.</a

    <p>
      <a name="12" id="12"
        >There is, therefore, a four-fold consideration of charity that can be
        made. First, charity is considered on the part of the Holy Spirit moving
        the soul to the love of God and neighbor. In this regard, it is
        necessary to say that the movement of the Holy Spirit is always
        efficacious according to its own intention. For, the Holy Spirit
        operates in the soul, dividing to everyone according as he will, as is
        written (1 Cor. xii. 11). Therefore those to whom the Holy Spirit freely
        wishes to give a persevering movement of divine love, in them sin cannot
        drive out charity. This cannot be, I say, on the part of the moving
        power, although it is possible on the part of the indetermination of
        free choice. For, these are the gifts of God by which those who are
        liberated are most certainly liberated, as Augustine says in
        <i>De Praedestinatione Sanctorum</i>. For though the Holy Spirit freely
        gives to some that at times they might be moved to love God, He does not
        give in such manner that they might persevere to the end in that love,
        as is clear from St. Augustine in <i>De Correctione et Gratia</i>.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="12" id="12"
        >Secondly, charity is considered according to the power of that charity.
        In this respect, no one who possesses charity can sin, in the sense of
        committing a sin by virtue of that charity; just as no one possessing
        any form can act contrary to that form by virtue of the form. For
        example, that which is warm, although it can lose heat and become cold,
        cannot become cold or be cold by virtue of its warmth. It was in this
        way that Augustine spoke in <i>De Sermone Domini in Monte</i>,
        explaining this text (Matt. vii. 18), A good tree cannot bring forth
        evil fruit. For, he said that it can happen that what was snow is not
        now snow, but it does not happen that snow is warm. Thus, he who was
        evil is not now evil, but it cannot be that an evil man acts rightly.
        And concerning the good, this same reasoning applies to all the virtues,
        for no one uses virtue for evil.</a

        >Thirdly, there is a consideration of charity from the side of the will
        insofar as the will is subjected to charity, as matter is to form. It
        must be noted that when form completes the entire potentiality of
        matter, the potency cannot remain in matter as potency to another form.
        Whence, it possesses that form in a manner such that it cannot be lost,
        as is evident with celestial matter. But there is a certain form which
        does not complete the entire potentiality of matter, but it remains in
        potency to another form. Then that form is possessed in such a manner
        that it can be lost on the part of matter, Le., on the subject; as is
        evident with the forms of the bodily elements. But charity completes the
        potentiality of its subject according as it reduces its subject to the
        act of love. Therefore in heaven, where the rational creature loves God
        in act with his whole heart, and loves nothing else except by referring
        it perfectly to God, charity is possessed in such a way that it is not
        lost. But in this present state of life, charity does not perfect all of
        the potentialities of the soul, and is not always perfectly directed to
        God because it must refer everything to Him by an actual intention.
        Therefore the charity of this life can be lost, considered on the part
        of the subject.</a

    <p>
      <a name="12" id="12"
        >The fourth consideration of charity is on the part of the subject
        according as it is compared in a special way to charity itself, as
        potency is compared to habit. It must be considered that the habit of
        virtue indines man to act rightly according as through it man has the
        right estimation of the end. For, as is said in Book III of the
        <i>Ethics</i>, according as a man is, such does the end seem to him. For
        example, just as taste judges flavor insofar as it is the affection for
        some good or bad disposition, so also that which is suitable to man
        according to a habitual disposition, inhering in him either as good or
        evil, is judged by him as a good; and what is not in accord with this is
        considered as evil and repugnant. Whence the Apostle says (1 Cor. ii.
        14), The sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the spirit
        of God. But it sometimes happens that that which seems to one to be
        according to the inclination of habit does not seem to him to be
        according to something else. For example, to one who has carnal delight,
        the delight of the flesh seems to be a good according to the inclination
        of his proper habit; but it seems to be contrary to the good according
        to the deliberation of reason or the text of Scripture. And because of
        this estimation, one who has the habit of carnal delight sometimes acts
        contrary to that habit. Likewise, one who has the habit of virtue
        sometimes acts contrary to the inclination of his proper habit; for a
        thing seems to him to be otherwise, according to some other mode, such
        as through passion or anything that entices him from the correct
        estimation. Therefore, no one will be able to act contrary to the habit
        of charity, because no one is able to have any judgment about the end
        and the object of charity other than that which he has according to the
        inclination of charity. This, however, will be in heaven where the very
        essence of God, which is the essence of goodness, will be seen. Thus,
        just as now no one can wish anything unless it be under the aspect of
        good, nor is any one able not to love the good as good; so also in the
        next life, no one will be able not to love this good, which is God.
        Because of this, no one who sees God in His essence can act against
        charity; and that is why the charity of heaven cannot be lost. However,
        now our mind does not see that essence of divine goodness; it sees some
        of its effects which can seem either good or not-good, according to
        different considerations. For, the spiritual good appears as not-good to
        some insofar as it is contrary to their carnal delight, which
        concupiscence desires. Therefore the charity of this life can be lost
        through mortal sin.</a

        which are contrary to the good of reason, he hates himself more than he
        loves himself, because it is written (Psalms x. 6), He that loveth
        iniquity hateth his own soul. And this the Philosopher also said in Book
        IX of the <i>Ethics</i>. According to this, true love of self is lost

        inordinately. But sometimes the contrary happens because of the
        indetermination of free choice and the corruption of nature; thus the

        begins in an existing thing and terminates in its non-being
        (<i>non-esse</i>), because the change is from being (<i>esse</i>) to
        non-being (<i>non-esse</i>); so does a loss, since it is a change from
        having to non-having, begin in having and terminate in non-having.
        Therefore the beginning of the loss of charity is when charity is had;

      <a name="12" id="12"
        >To the eleventh, it must be said that charity ceases to exist in the
        soul in some way according to these four modes. For, the subject of
        charity, although it is incorruptible according to its substance,
        becomes indisposed to this form through the contrary disposition of sin.
        Likewise, although the cause of charity is incorruptible, the influence
        of this cause is impeded by sin which separates us from God. Also,
        charity fails on the part of its object insofar as the will diverts
        itself from the unchangeable good. Charity even fails through the
        contrary movement to sinning; for, essentially speaking, although sin is
        weaker than charity, in some instances sin can be stronger, viz., when
        charity is not operating in act and the movement of sin directs toward
        some other particular operation. The Philosopher also showed in Book VII
        of the <i>Ethics</i>, that science, although it is stronger, can be
        overcome by passion; this is considered insofar as the agent is not in
        act but is bound up in habit because of passion. For, just as science is
        strongest in the universal, passion however operates in the particular;
        so also charity is strongest when acting toward the final end, but it
        allows the movement of sin which has strength in some particular act.</a

        what he intended to say in the <i>Praedicamentis</i> and in Book II of
        the <i>Ethics</i>. But in nature, one good is contrary to another, for
        each of the contraries is a certain good of nature. Therefore, the good
        which moves the appetite to sin is contrary to the divine good which is
        the object of charity, insofar as the end is found in the divine good.
        For there can be only one final end; just as in a kingdom, where there
        can be only one king, he who makes himself to be a king is contrary to
        the actual king, according to what is written (John xix. 12), Whosoever
        maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar.</a

        sin as by an agent, but as by its contrary. Thus, that intervening of
        sin is the expulsion of charity; just as the coming of light is the
        expulsion of darkness. For, the light drives out darkness by its own
        becoming; but a movement to sin drives out charity according as it
        pre-exists in the understanding of the soul.</a

        this is done by a certain deliberation of reason; for without a
        deliberating consent, there can be no mortal sin. But this deliberation
        is a measured movement of time in the last moment of which sin exists in
        the soul. But before that final instant, the nearest instant in which
        charity exists cannot be designated; because these moments are not
        regarded as moments following one another, for time is a continuum.
        Therefore in the entire time which precedes the moment that terminates
        in the final instant, charity exists in the soul; after the last instant
        of this time, sin exists. Thus it is not possible to designate the final
        instant in which charity exists, but the final time, as is shown by the

        perseveres to the end will be saved. And in this way he understands that
        he who does not remain faithful to the words of Christ is not a true
        disciple, because he has not learned from Him to persevere effectively.

        the movement of charity. Therefore the greatest remedy against sin is
        for man to return into his heart, converting it to the love of God. But
        when man is not moved in act according to charity, he is under pressure
        from the contrary movement of sin.</a

        generated or to become, is proper to that which has being (esse); i.e.,
        only a thing subsisting in its being (<i>esse</i>). But accidents and
        forms that are not subsisting are not called being because they have
        existence, but rather because by them something exists. Therefore, to
        become and to be corrupted are not proper to accidents and to forms, but
        to subjects. For example, when any thing becomes white, this is
        whiteness in becoming; just as for any thing to be white, is this
        existing whiteness. And the same reasoning holds for corruption.
        Therefore corruptible and incorruptible are not attributed directly to
        accidents, but only to substance. Whence, there is nothing that prevents
        the charity of this life and of heaven from being the same in number;

        it can sometimes happen, if one undergoes a slight fall and quickly
        recovers, it does not seem that he rushes to his complete downfall. But
        he who hast lost charity falls completely, according to this (1 Cor.

        is charity concerned with loving many things out of charity. But he who
        does not believe in one article of faith does not on that account lose
        faith in the other articles.~ Therefore he who sins against one object
        that should be loved out of charity does not on this account lose

      <a name="13" id="13"
        ><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that, without doubt, the habit of
        charity is taken away by one act of mortal sin, for a sin is not called
        mortal unless men die spiritually by it; which cannot happen with
        charity which is the life of the soul. Likewise, man also becomes worthy
        of eternal death through mortal sin, according to this (Rom. vi. 23),
        The wages of sin is death. But whoever has charity is worthy of eternal
        life, for the Lord promised to those who love Him a manifestation of His
        own self in which vision eternal life consists. Whence it must be said
        that man loses charity through any act of mortal sin. For, it is clear
        that in each act of mortal sin there is a turning away from the
        immutable good to which charity unites us. The act of mortal sin is
        opposed to this charity.</a

        >Now, because act is not directly contrary to habit but to act, one
        could see that through the act of mortal sin the opposite act of charity
        would be hindered; however, not so that the habit would be taken away,
        as it happens in acquired habits. For, no one loses the virtue of
        generosity if he acts contrary to that virtue.</a

        >This is not the case concerning the habit of charity. For, the habit of
        charity does not have a cause in the subject, but entirely depends on an
        extrinsic cause; for the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts,
        by the Holy Spirit, Who is given to us, as is written (Rom. v. 5).
        However, God does not cause charity in our soul so that He is the cause
        only of its becoming and not of its preservation; as the builder is the
        cause of a house only in its becoming, and when he is taken away, the
        house still remains. God, however, is the cause of charity and of grace
        in the soul both as regards their becoming and their preservation; just
        as the sun is the cause of light in the air. Therefore, just as light in
        the air immediately ceases if some obstacle is placed in the way, so
        does the habit of charity immediately cease in the soul when the soul
        turns itself away from God through sin. This is what Augustine says in
        Book VIII of <b>Super Gen. ad Litteram</b>, God does not operate in a
        lust man thus (that is, by justifying him), so that if He would depart,
        that which He effected would remain in His absence. Rather, lust as the
        air has not made itself lucid but becomes so in the presence of light,
        so man is illuminated when God is present to him; but he continues in
        darkness when God is absent.</a

        >To the first, it must be said that this saying of Origen can be
        understood in this way, that a man who is in a perfect state does not
        suddenly fall into the act of mortal sin, but does so through some
        previous negligence. But because he adds, If one undergoes a slight
        fall, etc., it seems better to say that he understood one who completely
        falls away falls so that he sins by malice, which fall does not come
        about suddenly. For, as the Philosopher says in Book I of the
        <i>Ethics</i>, it is not easy for a just man to perform unjust works
        suddenly as an unjust man does them, viz., by choice. Therefore one
        loses charity through one act of mortal sin, but some of the previous
        perfection remains if he has not lost charity out of malice.</a

      <a name="13" id="13"
        >To the second, it must be said that charity is lost in two ways;
        directly and indirectly. It is lost directly through an actual contempt
        for God, as happens with those who say to God (Job xxi. 14), Depart from
        us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. In another way, it is lost
        indirectly; just as one who is not thinking of God, consents to
        something that is against the law of God on account of some passion of
        fear or of concupiscence, and as a consequence loses charity. Therefore
        Bernard intended to say that charity was not extinct in Peter according
        to the first manner; but Peter lost it according to the second manner,
        and therefore Bernard calls it inactive. In the same way, the words of
        Leo should be understood, and this is clear from what he further adds,
        The cleansing remedy will not be far away where there was no judgment of
        the will; for the denial of Peter was driven by fear more than by a
        deliberate judgment of the will.</a

        >To the fourth, it must be said that an acquired virtue has its cause in
        the subject and is not entirely extrinsic, as is true of charity.
        Therefore the comparison between acquired virtue and charity cannot be
        made.</a

        >To the fifth, it must be said that in contraries, one contrary can be
        driven out without the other contrary coming in. But the habits of
        virtue and vice are mediated contraries; whence the Philosopher says in
        the <i>Praedicamentis</i>, there is a medium between good and evil.
        Whence it is not necessary to say that a man loses the habit of one
        virtue only when the habit of the contrary vice is generated in him.</a

    <p>
      <a name="13" id="13"
        >To the sixth, it must be said that a habit, of itself, regards the
        formal notion of its object more than the material notion of the object;
        therefore if the formal notion (ratio) of the object is taken away, the
        species of habit does not remain. However, the formal notion in the
        object of faith is the first truth manifested through the teaching of
        the Church; just as the formal notion of science is the medium of
        demonstration. Therefore, just as one who remembers the conclusions of
        geometry does not have the science of geometry if he does not assent to
        these conclusions because of the reasons of geometry, but he holds these
        conclusions only as opinion; so also one who holds those things which
        are of faith but does not assent to them because of the authority of
        Catholic teaching, does not have the habit of faith. For, he who asserts
        to anything because of Catholic teaching assents to all those things
        which that teaching contains. Otherwise, he would believe himself more
        than the teaching of the Church. From this it is clear that he who
        obstinately denies one article of faith does not have faith in the other
        articles—that faith, I say, which is an infused habit, for he holds the
        conclusions of faith as opinion.</a
