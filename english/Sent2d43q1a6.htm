        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>Response:</i> Some say that the sin of the first man and that of the demons were not against the Father, the Son or the Holy Spirit. For these are not absolutely accepted as the differences of sin, but of sin which belongs to (our) fallen nature. For weakness, ignorance and malice follow upon the fallen nature by reason of sin. But it should be recognized that although weakness in no way can arise within an unfallen nature, and that likewise neither can the sin against the Father, nevertheless, ignorance, in a certain way, can arise in the unfallen nature, that is, not in so far as ignorance is said privatively, but rather as it is said negatively. For it is a defect following upon a created intellect in as much as it is created. By reason of this, the created intellect prescinds from the perfect light of the uncreated intellect so that it does not know everything, or at least it does not actually consider all things. By reason of this kind of unknowing, a sin which arises can be called a sin against the Son. In like fashion, too, malice, by reason of which the sin against the Holy Spirit arises, is not necessarily a penalty, but is, rather, an act of sin, as was said above. Whence, there could be, in the unfallen state, a sin against the Son and the Holy Spirit. It should be noted, however, that the first act of the sin of both the first man and angel was not against the Holy Spirit, as the sin against the Holy Spirit is a definite (kind of) sin, which is evident by reason of the very object of this sin. For both sinned by desiring (in a disordered way) their own greatness. With respect, then, to the genus of sin, there was the sin of pride. But with respect to the circumstance of sin, both committed a sin against the Son because both sinned by reason of the fact that they did not consider those things which were to be considered so as to avoid sin. However, their first sin did not come about in so far as they rejected hope by their own will, or some other like thing, as is the case in the sin against the Holy Spirit.</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>Response to Objection 2:</i> Although Adam, as he sinned, thought about the mercy of God, nonetheless he did not commit the sin of presumption because he did not consider the mercy that would follow without his repentance.

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>Response to Objection 3:</i> The sin of an angel does not have the aspect of the unforgivable by reason of the kind of sin it is, but rather because of the state of the one who sins, as was said above. For this reason, the argument does not proceed.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">ad sextum dicendum, quod ad primum actum peccati in angelo, qui fuit actus superbiae, consecutae sunt multae aliae deformitates peccatorum, ut invidia, odium, et hujusmodi; et inter illa potuit esse peccatum in spiritum sanctum.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>Response to Objection 5:</i> With respect to the first act of the sin of the angel, which was an act of pride, there followed many other deformities of sins, such as envy, hatred, and others.

      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">ad septimum dicendum, quod peccatum in patrem non dicitur ex objecto, sed potius ex causa: et ideo quamvis potentiam appetierit, non sequitur quod in patrem peccaverit, quia non ex infirmitate peccavit. unde et ratio illi similis, per quam ostendebatur quod homo primus in filium peccaverit, non concludebat.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>Response to the 3rd. on the contrary:</i> The sin against the Father is not designated by reason of its object, but rather by reason of its cause. Thus, although he had desired power, it does not follow that he had sinned against the Father because he did not sin by reason of weakness. And so, arguments like these, through which it has been shown that the first man had sinned against the Son, do not conclude.</font>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">ad octavum dicendum, quod malitia, ex qua peccatum in spiritum sanctum esse dicitur, non oportet ut sit poena peccati, ut dictum est; et ideo ratio non procedit, quamvis conclusio sit vera.</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font=""><i>Response to the 4th. on the contrary:</i> It is not necessary that malice, by reason of which the sin against the Holy Spirit is designated, be a penalty of sin, as has been said.

This is so said because certain sins (committed) in the future are pardoned, as certain venial sins are (as Gregory states), not only with respect to the penalty, but also with regard to the blame. I do not speak (thus) so that anyone might pray on (such a sinner's) behalf. If the sin unto death is understood as the sin against the Holy Spirit, especially as this sin requires final impenitence, according to this view, it is understood that no one prays on behalf of such people. For whoever perdures in mortal sin up to death is not helped by prayers afterwards. If, however, the sin against the Holy Spirit be taken according to another view, as it does not require final impenitence, it is understood that one does not pray for him, that is, in any such way. For a conversion of such a kind is, as it were, miraculous. Hence, not just any person prays for miracles to be performed, but rather great and holy men. Likewise, for a conversion of that sort (it is fit that only the great and holy pray for such).</font>

        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">tamen secundum formam verborum non prohibetur oratio pro eo fieri; sed ostenditur quod praeceptum de orando pro proximis fidelibus non se extendit ad tales peccatores: quia propter sui peccati enormitatem hoc merentur ut a fidelibus relinquantur, sicut ethnici et publicani. qui autem blasphemaverit in spiritum sanctum, non remittetur ei neque hic neque in futuro. glossa ibidem dicit, scilicet matth. 12, quod blasphemia remittitur, spiritus autem blasphemiae non remittitur. blasphemia enim nominat ipsum peccati genus absolute: quod contingit quandoque ex infirmitate, sicut cum quis ex irae passione blasphemat; quandoque etiam ex ignorantia, sicut in his qui errant, male de deo sentientes. sed spiritus blasphemiae est voluntas blasphemandi, quando scilicet ex certa malitia blasphematur: et tunc est peccatum in spiritum sanctum. discuti oportet, an aliud obstinatio, aliud impoenitentia sit peccatum. hujus quaestionis apparet solutio secundum distinctionem impoenitentiae prius positam. si enim impoenitentia sumatur pro actuali duratione in obstinatione usque ad mortem, non est aliud peccatum ab obstinatione, sed circumstantia ejus; si autem impoenitentia sumatur prout dicit propositum non poenitendi, sic est aliud peccatum.]</font>
        <td align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size="3" font="">Nevertheless according to the form of the words (that is to say, with an emphasis upon the particular words used in this context, for this purpose: <i>formam verborum</i> - see ST III.72.3.ad2, and III.78.1.ad1), prayer is not prohibited on his behalf that these things (for which one prays) may come to be. But it is argued that the command that one ought to pray on behalf of his faithful neighbors is not to be extended to sinners of this kind (namely sins against the Holy Spirit). For on account of the enormity of their sin, they merit this (kind of treatment) so that they be removed from the faithful, just as was the case with the foreigner and the publican. He, who has blasphemed against the Holy Spirit, will not be forgiven either now or in the future. The Gloss at Matthew 12 says that blasphemy is forgiven, but not the spirit of blasphemy. For blasphemy denotes a kind of sin absolutely which happens whenever one sins by reason of weakness, as when someone blasphemes by reason of the passion of anger, and whenever one sins by reason of ignorance, as when those err when they speak badly about matters relating to God. But the spirit of blasphemy is the will to commit blasphemy, when, namely, one blasphemes by reason of a definite malice. And then, the sin against the Holy Spirit (is committed). It is befitting to discuss whether obstinacy is one sin, and impenitence another. The solution of this question is evident according to the distinction concerning impenitence put forth previously. For if impenitence is understood as the active duration in obstinacy up to death, it is not a sin distinct from obstinacy, but (differs only with respect to) its circumstance. If, however, impenitence is understood according to the one who puts forth the intention of not repenting, in this way it is a different sin.]</font>
