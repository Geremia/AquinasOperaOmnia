      This short tract,
      <em
        >De rationibus fidei contra Saracenos, Graecos et Armenos ad Cantorem
        Antiochenum</em
      >, was written by St. Thomas Aquinas (d. 1276) at Orvieto, Italy, in 1264.
      It follows right on the heels of his longer
      <em>Summa contra gentiles</em>, completed that same year. We do not know
      who the Cantor of Antioch was, except that he must have been in charge of
      music in the cathedral. Perhaps his bishop, the Dominican Christian Elias,
      referred him to Thomas Aquinas. The questions the Cantor asks must have
      been the subject of lively discussions in a city where Latin Christians
      mixed with Eastern Christians and Muslims.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter work, written at the request of St. Raymond of Peñafort to help
      Dominicans preaching to Muslims and Jews in Spain and North Africa,
      concentrated on how Christian doctrine could be presented to people who do
      not accept the authority of the Bible. It said little about Islam
      directly, since Thomas Aquinas admitted that he knew very little about it
      (Book I, ch. 2). He therefore concentrated on explaining the Catholic
      Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present work takes up Muslim objections never mentioned in the
      <em>Contra gentiles</em>. Thomas' answers use material already discussed
      in greater detail in that work. The originality of the present work is its
      concise brevity and its focus on the essential points where the Catholic
      Faith differs from and transcends Islam.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this work Thomas shows a good grasp of what these differences are:
      first of all, the Trinity and how God shares his life with us in the
      Incarnation, then the crucifixion of Jesus and the whole question of human
      force and power in religion. The objection to the real presence of Jesus
      in the Eucharist is not a standard Muslim objection, but I have heard it.
      The final one, on determination, was much discussed in Muslim theology and
      philosophy; its theoretical and practical implications are greater than
      most Muslims or Christians realize, but it is very summarily treated here.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work is from the Middle Ages and does not reflect all the nuances of
      current Catholic teaching regarding Islam. An instance of this is the use
      of the term "unbelievers" which Thomas uses of Muslims. The Church today
      calls them believers, although they do not believe in all that Christians
      believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this translation, from the Marietti 1954 edition of the
      <em>Opuscula theologica</em>, I have given priority to clear plain English
      rather than literal fidelity. Yet I could not but retain some
      philosophical vocabulary, such as "substance", "accident", "hypostasis"
      and "predication".

    </p>
    <p>
      Blessed Peter the Apostle received a promise from the Lord that on his
      confession of faith the Church would be founded and that the gates of Hell
      would not prevail against it. That the faith of the Church entrusted to
      him would hold out inviolate against these gates of Hell, he address the
      faithful of Christ (1 Pet 3:15): "Proclaim the Lord Christ holy in your
      hearts," that is, by firmness of faith. With this foundation established
      in our hearts we can be safe against any attacks or ridicule of
      unbelievers against our Faith. Therefore Peter adds: "Always have your
      answer ready for people who ask you the reason for the hope that you
      have."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christian <strong>faith</strong> principally consists in acknowledging
      the holy Trinity, and it specially glories in the cross of our Lord Jesus
      Christ. For "the message of the cross", says Paul (1 Cor 1:18), "is folly
      for those who are on the way to ruin, but for those of us who are on the
      road to salvation it is the power of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our <strong>hope</strong> is directed to two things: (1) what we look
      forward to after death, and (2) the help of God which carries us through
      this life to future happiness merited by works done by free will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are the things you say the Muslims attack and ridicule: They
      ridicule the fact that we say Christ is the Son of God, when God has no
      wife (Qur'ân 6:110; 72:3); and they think we are insane for professing
      three persons in God, even though we do not mean by this three gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      They also ridicule our saying that Christ the Son of God was crucified for
      the salvation of the human race (Qur'ân 4:157-8), for if almighty God
      could save the human race without the Son's suffering he could also make
      man so that he could not sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      They also hold against Christians their claim to eat God on the altar, and
      that if the body of Christ were even as big as a mountain, by now it
      should have been eaten up.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the state of souls after death, you say that the Greeks and Armenians
      hold the error that souls after death are neither punished nor rewarded
      until the day of judgement, but are in some waiting room, since they can
      receive no punishment or reward without the body. To back up their error
      they quote the Lord in the Gospel (Jn 14:2): "In my Father's house there
      are many places to live in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning merit, which depends on free will, you assert that the Muslims
      and other nations hold that God's fore-knowledge or decree imposes
      necessity on human actions; thus they say that man cannot die or even sin
      unless God decrees this, and that every person has his destiny written on
      his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these questions you ask for moral and philosophical reasons which the
      Muslims can accept. For it would be useless to quote passages of Scripture
      against those who do not accept this authority. I wish to satisfy your
      request, which seems to arise from pious desire, so that you may be
      prepared with apostolic doctrine to satisfy anyone who asks you for an
      explanation. On these questions I will make some explanations as easy as
      the subjects allow, since I have written more amply about them elsewhere
      [in the <em>Summa contra gentiles</em> ].<br />

        ></strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all I wish to warn you that in disputations with unbelievers
      about articles of the Faith, you should not try to prove the Faith by
      necessary reasons. This would belittle the sublimity of the Faith, whose
      truth exceeds not only human minds but also those of angels; we believe in
      them only because they are revealed by God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet whatever come from the Supreme Truth cannot be false, and what is not
      false cannot be repudiated by any necessary reason. Just as our Faith
      cannot be proved by necessary reasons, because it exceeds the human mind,
      so because of its truth it cannot be refuted by any necessary reason. So
      any Christian disputing about the articles of the Faith should not try to
      prove the Faith, but defend the Faith. Thus blessed Peter (1 Pet 3:15) did
      not say: "Always have your proof", but "your answer ready," so that reason
      can show that what the Catholic Faith holds is not false.<br />

          >Chapter 3: How generation applies to God</font
        ></strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all we must observe that Muslims are silly in ridiculing us for
      holding that Christ is the Son of the living God, as if God had a wife.
      Since they are carnal, they can think only of what is flesh and blood. For
      any wise man can observe that the mode of generation is not the same for
      everything, but generation applies to each thing according to the special
      manner of its nature. In animals it is by copulation of male and female;
      in plants it is by pollination or generation, and in other things in other
      ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      God, however, is not of a fleshly nature, requiring a woman to copulate
      with to generate offspring, but he is of a spiritual or intellectual
      nature, much higher than every intellectual nature. So generation should
      be understood of God as it applies to an intellectual nature. Even though
      our own intellect falls far short of the divine intellect, we still have
      to speak of the divine intellect by comparing it with what we find in our
      own intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our intellect understands sometimes potentially, sometimes actually.
      Whenever it actually understands it forms something intelligible, a kind
      of offspring, which is called a concept, something conceived by the mind.
      This is signified by an audible voice, so that as the audible voice is
      called the exterior word, the interior concept of the mind signified by
      the exterior audible word is called the word of the intellect or mind. A
      concept of our mind is not the very essence of our mind, but something
      accidental to it, because even our act of understanding is not the very
      being of our intellect; otherwise our intellect would have to be always in
      act.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the word of our intellect can be likened to a concept or offspring,
      especially when the intellect understands itself and the concept is a
      likeness of the intellect coming from its intellectual power, just as a
      son has a likeness to his father, from whose generative power he comes
      forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word of our intellect is not properly an offspring or son, because it
      is not of the same nature as our intellect. Not everything that comes
      forth from another, even if it is similar to its source, is called a son;
      otherwise a painted picture of someone would be a son. To be a son, it is
      required that the one coming forth from the other must not only resemble
      its source but also be of the same nature with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in God understanding is not different from his being. Consequently the
      word which is conceived in his intellect is not something accidental to
      him or alien from his nature but, by the very fact that it is a word, it
      must be coming forth from another and must be a likeness of its source.
      All this is true even of our own word.
    </p>
    <p>
      But besides this, the Word of God is not an accident or a part of God, who
      is simple, nor something extrinsic to the divine nature, but is something
      complete, subsisting in the divine nature and coming forth from another,
      as any word must be. In our human way of talking, this is called a son,
      because it comes forth from another in its likeness and subsists in the
      same nature with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, as far as divine things can be represented by human words, we
      call the Word of the divine intellect the Son of God, while God, whose
      Word he is, we call the Father. We say that the coming forth of the Word
      is an immaterial generation of a son, not a carnal one, as carnal men
      surmise.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another way that this generation of the Son of God surpasses
      every human generation, whether material, as when one man is born from
      another, or intelligible, as when a word is brought forth in the human
      mind. In either of these cases what is born is younger than its source. A
      father does not generate as soon as he begins to exist, but he must first
      mature. Even the act of generation takes time before a son is born,
      because carnal generation is a matter of stages. Likewise the human
      intellect is not ready to form intelligible concepts as soon as a man is
      born, but when he matures. So he does not always actually understand, but
      after potentially understanding he actually understands and again stops
      actually understanding and remains understanding only in potency or with
      habitual knowledge. So a human word is younger than a man and sometimes
      stops existing before the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these two limitations cannot apply to God, who has no imperfection or
      change, or going from potency to act, since he is pure and first act. The
      Word of God, therefore, is co-eternal with God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another difference of our word from the divine is that our intellect does
      not simultaneously understand everything, or with one act, but by many
      different acts; therefore the words of our intellect are many. But God
      understands everything simultaneously by one single act, because his
      understanding must be one, since it is his very being. It follows
      therefore that in God there is only one word.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is yet another difference: The word of our intellect does not
      measure up to the power of our intellect, because when we mentally
      conceive one thing we can still conceive many other things; thus the word
      of our intellect is imperfect and can be composed, when several imperfect
      notions are put together to form a more perfect word, as happens in the
      process of formulating a definition. But the divine Word measures up to
      the power of God, because by his essence he understands himself and
      everything else. So the Word he conceives by his essence, when he
      understands himself and everything else, is as great as his essence. It is
      therefore perfect, simple and equal to God. We call this Word of God a
      Son, as said above, because he is of the same nature with the Father, and
      we profess that he is co-eternal with the Father, only-begotten and
      perfect.<br />

        ></strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      We must also observe that every act of knowledge is followed by an act of
      the appetite. Of all appetitive acts love is the principle. Without it
      there is no joy at gaining something one does not love, or sadness at
      missing something one does not love - that is, if love is taken away;
      likewise all other appetitive acts would go, since they are all somehow
      related to sadness and joy. Therefore, since God has perfect knowledge, he
      must also have perfect love, which arises as the expression of an
      appetitive act, as a word arises as the expression of an intellective act.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is a difference between an intellectual and an appetitive act.
      For an intellectual act and any other act of knowledge takes place by the
      knowable thing somehow existing in the knowing power, namely, sensible
      things in the sense and intelligible things in the intellect. But an
      appetitive act takes place by an orientation and movement of the
      appetitive power to the things exposed to the appetite. Things that have a
      hidden source of their motion are called spirits. For instance, winds are
      called spirits because their origin is not apparent. Likewise breath,
      which is a motion from an intrinsic source, is called spirit. So, as
      divine things are expressed in human terms, the very love coming from God
      is called a spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in us love comes from two different sources. Sometimes it comes from a
      bodily and material principle, which is impure love, since it disturbs the
      purity of the mind. Sometimes it comes from the a pure spiritual
      principle, as when we love intelligible goods and what is in accord with
      reason; this is pure love. God cannot have a material love. Therefore we
      fittingly call his love not simply Spirit, but the Holy Spirit, since
      holiness refers to his purity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear that we cannot love anything with an intelligible and holy
      love unless we conceive it through an act of the intellect. The conception
      of the intellect is a word; so love must arise from a word. We call the
      Word of God the Son; so it is clear that the Holy Spirit comes from the
      Son. Just as God's act of knowledge is his very being, so also is his act
      of loving. And just as God is always actually understanding, so also he is
      always actually loving himself and everything else by loving his own
      goodness. Therefore, as the Son of God, who is the Word of God, subsists
      in the divine nature and is co-eternal with the Father and perfect and
      unique, likewise we must profess the same about the Holy Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since everything that subsists with an intelligent nature we call a
      "person", which is equivalent to the Greek "hypostasis", it is necessary
      to say that the Word of God, whom we call Son, is a hypostasis or person.
      No one doubts that God, from whom a word and a love comes forth, is a
      subsistent reality, and can also be called a hypostasis or a person. Thus
      we fittingly posit three persons in God: the person of the Father, the
      person of the Son and the person of the Holy Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not say that these three persons or hypostases are distinct by
      essence, since, just as God's act of knowing and loving is his very being,
      so also his Word and Love are the very essence of God. Whatever is
      absolutely asserted of God is nothing other than his essence, since God is
      not great or powerful or good accidentally, but by his essence. So we do
      not say the three persons or hypostases are distinct absolutely, but by
      mere relations which arise from the coming forth of the word and the love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we call the coming forth of the word generation, and from generation
      result the relationships of fatherhood and sonship, we say that the person
      of the Son is distinct from the person of the Father only by fatherhood
      and sonship, while all else belongs to both commonly and without
      distinction. Just as we call the Father true God, almighty, eternal and
      whatever else, so also the Son, and for the same reason the Holy Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, since the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit are not
      distinct in their divine nature, but only by relationship, we are right in
      saying that the three persons are not three gods, but one true and perfect
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three human persons are three men and not one man, because the nature of
      humanity, which is common to them, belongs to each separately because they
      are materially distinct, which does not apply to God. So in three men
      there are three numerically different human natures, while only the
      essence of humanity is common to them. But in the divine persons there are
      not three numerically different divine natures, but necessarily only one
      simple divine nature, since the essence of God's word and of his love is
      not different from the essence of God. So we profess not three gods, but
      one God, because of the one simple divine nature in three persons.<br />

        ></strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar blindness makes Muslims ridicule the Christian Faith by which we
      profess that the Son of God died, since they do not understand the depth
      of such a great mystery. First of all, lest the death of the Son of God be
      misinterpreted, we must first say something about the incarnation of the
      Son of God. For we do not say that the Son of God underwent death
      according to his divine nature, in which he is equal to the Father who is
      the foundational life of everything, but according to our own nature which
      he adopted into the unity of his person.
    </p>
    <p>
      To say something about the mystery of the divine incarnation, we must
      observe that any intellectual agent operates through a conception of his
      intellect, which we call a word, as is clear in the case of a builder or
      any craftsman who operates outwardly according to the form that he
      conceives in his mind. Since the Son of God is the very Word of God, it
      follows that God made everything through the Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a rule that the principles which make something are also the
      principles for repairing it. If a house falls down, it is restored
      according to the plan by which it was first made. Among the creatures
      created through God's Word, rational creatures hold the first rank, since
      all other creatures serve them and seem ordered to them. That is
      reasonable, because a rational creature has mastery over his action
      through free will, while other creatures do not act from free judgement
      but by force of nature. Universally what is free is higher than what is in
      bondage; slaves serve the free and are governed by them. Therefore the
      fall of a rational creature is truly considered more serious than the
      defect of any irrational creature. Nor is there any doubt that God judges
      things according to their real value. So it was fitting for Divine Wisdom
      to repair the fall of human nature, much more than to step in if the
      heavens were to fall or any other catastrophe occur in bodily things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rational or intellectual creatures are of two kinds: one separated from a
      body, which we call an angel, and the other joined to a body, which is the
      human soul. In either one there can be a fall because of freedom of the
      will. By a fall, I do not mean that they fall out of existence, but that
      they lapse from righteousness of the will. A fall or a defect refers
      specially to a principle of operation, as we say that a craftsman has gone
      wrong because he is deficient in the skill he needs to do his job, and we
      say that a natural thing is deficient or spoiled if the natural power by
      which it acts is corrupted, for example if a plant lacks the power of
      germinating or a piece of land lacks the power to be fruitful. A rational
      creature operates by its will, where it has freedom of choice. Therefore
      the fall of a rational creature is a defect of righteousness of the will,
      which takes place by sin. The defect of sin, which is nothing other than
      perversity of the will, is something especially for God to remove, and
      that by his Word by which he created all creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sin of angels, however, could not be corrected, because the
      immutability of their nature makes them impenitent from any direction they
      once take. But men's will is changeable by nature, so that they are not
      only able to choose different things, good or evil, but also abandon one
      choice and turn to another. This changeableness of the will remains in man
      as long as he is united to his body which is subject to variation. When
      the soul is separated from the body it will have the same immutability as
      an angel naturally has; so that after death the soul is impenitent, and
      cannot turn from good to evil or from evil to good. Therefore it was
      fitting for God's goodness to restore fallen human nature through his Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way of restoring should correspond to the nature being restored and to
      its sickness. The nature to be restored was man's rational nature endowed
      with free will, who should not be subject to exterior power but be
      recalled to the state of righteousness according to his own will. His
      sickness, being a perversity of the will, demanded that the will should be
      called back to righteousness. Righteousness of the human will consists in
      the proper ordering of love, which is its principal act. Rightly ordered
      love is to love God above all things as our supreme good, and to refer to
      him everything that we love as our ultimate goal, and to observe the
      proper order in loving other things by preferring spiritual to bodily
      goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      To excite our love towards God, there was no more powerful way than that
      the Word of God, through whom all things were made, should assume our
      human nature in order to restore it, so that he would be both God and man.
      First of all, because the strongest way God could show how much he loves
      man was his willing to become man for his salvation; and nothing can
      provoke love more than to know that one is loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then also, man whose intellect and affections are weighed down towards
      bodily things cannot easily turn to things that are above himself. It is
      easy for any man to know and love another man, but to think of the divine
      highness and be carried to it by the proper affection of love is not for
      everyone, but only for those who, by God's help and with great effort and
      labour, are lifted up from bodily to spiritual things. Therefore, to open
      the way to God for everyone, God willed to become man, so that even
      children could know and love God as someone like themselves; and so by
      what they can grasp they can progress little by little to perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, for God to become man gave man the hope of eventually participating
      in perfect happiness, which only God naturally has. If man, knowing his
      weakness, were promised the eventual happiness of which angels are hardly
      capable, since it consists in the vision and enjoyment of God, he could
      hardly hope to reach it unless the dignity of human nature was
      demonstrated in another way, namely, by God valuing it so highly that he
      became man for his salvation. So God's becoming man gave us hope that man
      can eventually be united to God in blessed enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man's knowledge of his dignity, coming from God's assuming a human nature,
      helps to keep him from subjecting his affections to any creature, whether
      by worshipping demons or any creatures through idolatry or by subjecting
      himself to bodily creatures through disordered affection. For if man has
      such a great dignity by God's judgement and he is so close to him that God
      wanted to become man, it is unworthy of man to subject himself improperly
      to things inferior to God.<br />

        ></strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      When we say that God became man, let no one take this to mean that God was
      converted into a man, as air becomes fire when it is turned into fire. For
      God's nature is unchangeable. Only bodily things can be changed from one
      thing into another. A spiritual nature cannot be changed into a bodily
      nature, but can be united to it somehow by the strength of its power, as a
      soul is united to a body. Although human nature consists of soul and body,
      the soul is not of a bodily but a spiritual nature. But the distance
      between any spiritual creature and God's simplicity is much more than the
      distance between a bodily creature and the simplicity of a spiritual
      nature. Therefore, as a spiritual nature can be united to a body by the
      strength of its power, so God can be united to a spiritual or a bodily
      nature. And in that way we say that God was united to a human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should observe that everything seems most properly identified with what
      is principal in it, while other aspects seem to adhere to what is
      principal and are taken up and used by it as it disposes. Thus in civil
      society the king seems to envelop the whole kingdom and he uses others as
      he disposes as if they were parts of his own body joined to him naturally.
      Although man is naturally both soul and body, he seems more principally a
      soul, since the body adheres to it and the soul uses the body to serve its
      own activity. Likewise, therefore, in the union of God with a creature,
      the divinity is not dragged down to human nature, but the human nature is
      assumed by God, not to be converted into God, but to adhere to God. The
      body and soul thus assumed are somehow the body and soul of God himself,
      just as the parts of a body assumed by a soul are somehow members of the
      soul itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, however, a difference. Although the soul is more perfect than
      the body, it does not possess the total perfection of human nature. Thus
      it has a body so that the body and soul together form one human nature, of
      which the soul and body are parts. But God is perfect in his nature and
      nothing can be added to the fullness of his nature. So another nature
      cannot be united to the divine nature so as to make a common nature from
      them both. For it would be repugnant to the perfection of the divine
      nature to be a part of that common nature. The Word of God therefore
      assumed a human nature consisting of a soul and a body in such a way that
      neither becomes the other, nor are the two melted into one nature, but
      after being united the two natures remain distinct, each with their own
      properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should also be observed that, since a spiritual nature is united to a
      bodily one by spiritual power, the greater the power of the spiritual
      nature the more perfectly and firmly it assumes a lower nature. God's
      power is infinite, with every creature subject to him and he uses each as
      he wishes. He could not use them unless he were somehow united with them
      by the strength of his power. The more he exercises his power on them, the
      more perfectly he is united with them. Among all creatures he exercises
      his power by giving them existence and moving them to their proper
      operations; in this way he is said to be in everything in a common way.
      But he exercises his power in a special way in holy minds, whom he not
      only conserves them in existence and moves them in their actions like
      other creatures, but also converts them to know and love him; thus he is
      said to dwell especially in holy minds, and holy minds are said to be full
      of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since God is said to be more or less united to a creature according to the
      amount of power he exercises in it, it is clear that, since the strength
      of divine power cannot be comprehended by the human intellect, God can be
      united to a creature in a higher way than the human intellect can grasp.
      Therefore we say that God is united to a human nature in Christ in an
      incomprehensible and ineffable way, not only by indwelling as is true of
      other saints, but in a singular way, so that a human nature belongs to the
      Son of God, and that the Son of God, who has from eternity a divine nature
      from the Father, from a point of time has wonderfully assumed a human
      nature of our race. Thus each and every part of the human nature of the
      Son of God can be called God, and whatever any part of his human nature
      does or suffers can be attributed to the only-begotten Word of God. Thus
      we fittingly say that not just his soul and body are the Son of God, but
      also his eyes and hands, and that the Son of God sees bodily with the
      sight of his eyes and hears by the hearing of his ears; the same applies
      to the activities proper to the other parts of his soul or body.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no better comparison of this admirable union than the union of a
      body and a rational soul. It is also a suitable comparison because our
      word remains hidden in our heart and becomes sensible by being vocalized
      and written. But these comparisons fall short of representing the union of
      the divine and human natures, just as any other comparison of human things
      with divine. For the Divinity is not united to a human nature so as to be
      a part of a nature, nor is it united to a human nature as an expression,
      as the word of the heart is signified by a voice or writing, but the Son
      of God truly has a human nature and can be called a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear therefore that we do not say God is united to a bodily nature
      as a force in the body after the manner of material and bodily forces,
      because not even the intellect of a soul united to a body is a bodily
      power. Much less therefore is the Word of God, who assumed for himself a
      human nature in an ineffable and more sublime way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also clear from the foregoing that the Son of God has both a divine
      and a human nature, the one from eternity, the other assumed from a point
      of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many things can be had by the same person in different ways, but the
      principal element is always said to "have", while the less principal
      elements are "had". Thus the whole has many parts, as a man has hands and
      feet; we do not say the inverse: that hands and feet have a man. Likewise
      one subject has many accidents, as an apple has colour and smell, but not
      the inverse. Man also has exterior things, like possessions and clothing,
      but not the inverse. Only in the case of essential parts is something said
      both to have and to be had, as the soul has the body and the body has the
      soul. And in marriage a man has a wife and a wife has a husband. The same
      in the case of things united by relationship: thus we say that a father
      has a son and a son has a father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were God united to a human nature as a soul to a body so as to make one
      common nature, we could say that God has a human nature and a human nature
      has God, just as a soul has a body and the inverse. But because the divine
      and human natures cannot be made one nature because of the divine
      perfection, as said above, and because the principal factor in the union
      is on the side of God, it clearly follows that we must say that God has a
      human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever is said to exist by a nature is called a subject or hypostasis of
      that nature, just as what has the nature of a horse is called a hypostasis
      or a subject with a horse-nature. In the case of an intellectual nature
      such a hypostasis is called a person; thus we call Peter a person because
      he has a human nature, which is intellectual. Since the Son of God, the
      only-begotten Word of God, has assumed a human nature, as said above, it
      follows that he is a hypostasis, subject or person with a human nature.
      And since he has a divine nature from eternity, not by way of composition
      but by simple identity, he is also called a hypostasis or person of divine
      nature, as far as divine things can be expressed by human words. Therefore
      the only-begotten Word of God is a hypostasis or person with two natures,
      divine and human, and he subsists in these two natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if anyone objects that human nature, even in Christ, is not
      accidental, but a substance, and not a universal substance but a
      particular one which is called a hypostasis, it would seem that Christ's
      human nature would be a hypostasis apart from the hypostasis of the Word
      of God, and that in Christ there would be two hypostases.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one who makes this objection should observe that not every particular
      substance is called a hypostasis, but only that which does not belong to
      something more principal. For instance, the hand of a man is a particular
      substance, but is not called a hypostasis or a person, because it belongs
      to a more principal substance which is man; otherwise in every man there
      would be as many hypostases or persons as there are members or parts.
      Therefore Christ's human nature is not accidental but a substance; it is
      not universal but particular; nevertheless it cannot be called a
      hypostasis, because it is assumed by something more principal, namely, the
      Word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore Christ is one because of the unity of his person or hypostasis,
      and he cannot be called two; rather he is properly said to have two
      natures. Although the divine nature can be predicated of the hypostasis of
      Christ, which is the hypostasis of the Word of God, which is his essence,
      nevertheless human nature cannot be predicated of him abstractly, just as
      it cannot in the case of anyone having a human nature: Just as we cannot
      say that Peter is human nature, but is a man having a human nature, so we
      cannot say the Word of God is a human nature, but that it has taken on a
      human nature and for this reason can be called a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore each nature is predicated of the Word of God, but the human
      nature only concretely, as when we say that the Son of God is a man. But
      the divine nature can be predicated both abstractly and concretely: thus
      the Word of God is the divine essence or nature and is God. But since God
      has a divine nature and man has a human nature, these two names signify
      the two natures that are had, but only one person has both of them. Since
      the one having the nature is a hypostasis, when we call Christ God we
      understand the hypostasis of the Word of God; likewise when we call him a
      man we understand the Word of God. So we call Christ God and man, but do
      not say that he is two, but one in two natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever belongs to a nature can be attributed to the hypostasis of that
      nature, while a hypostasis of both a human and a divine nature is supposed
      in a name signifying the divine nature as well as in a name signifying the
      human nature; this hypostasis is single having both natures. Consequently
      both human and divine things can be predicated by that hypostasis, whether
      it is referred to by a name signifying the divine nature or by a name
      signifying the human nature. Thus we can say that God, the Word of God,
      was conceived and born of the Virgin, suffered, died and buried,
      attributing to the hypostasis of the Word human things because of the
      human nature. Inversely we can say that man is one with the Father, that
      he is from eternity and that he created the world, because of the divine
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In predicating such diverse things of Christ a distinction can be made
      according to which nature they are predicated. Some things are said
      according to his human nature and others according to his divine nature.
      But if we consider whom they are said about, they apply indistinctly,
      since it is the same hypostasis of which divine and human things are said.
      It is like saying that the same man sees and hears, but not according to
      the same power; he sees with his eyes and hears with his ears. Likewise
      the same apple is seen and smelt, in the first case by its colour, in the
      second by its smell. For this reason we can say that the seeing person
      hears and the hearing person sees, and that what is seen is smelt and what
      is smelt is seen. Similarly we can say that God is born of the Virgin,
      because of his human nature, and that man is eternal, because of the
      divine nature.<br />

    <p>
      The foregoing shows that there is no contradiction in our professing that
      the only-begotten Word of God suffered and died. We do not attribute this
      to him according to his divine nature but according to his human nature,
      which he assumed into the unity of his person for our salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if someone objects that, since God is almighty, he could have saved
      the human race otherwise than by the death of his only-begotten Son, such
      a person ought to observe that in God's deeds we must consider what was
      the most fitting way of acting, even if he could have acted otherwise;
      otherwise we will be faced with this question in everything he made. Thus
      if it is asked why God made the heaven of a certain size and why he made
      the stars in such a number, a wise thinker will look for what was fitting
      for God to do, even if he could have done otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say this supposing our belief that the whole disposition of nature and
      all human acts are subject to Divine Providence. Take this belief away and
      all worship of the Divinity is excluded. Yet we argue presently against
      those who say they are worshippers of God, whether Muslims or Christians
      or Jews. As for those who say that everything comes necessarily from God,
      we argued at length elsewhere [ <em>Contra gentiles</em>, II, c. 23].
      Therefore if someone considers with a pious intention the fittingness of
      the suffering and death of Christ, he will find such a depth of knowledge
      that any time he thinks about it he will find more and greater things, so
      that he can experience as true what the Apostle says (1 Cor 1:23-24): "We
      are preaching a crucified Christ: to the Jews an obstacle they cannot get
      over, to the gentiles foolishness, but to those who have been called,
      whether they are Jews or Greeks, a Christ who is both the power of God and
      the wisdom of God." He continues (v. 25): "God's folly is wiser than human
      wisdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, we must observe that Christ assumed a human nature to repair
      the fall of man, as we have said. Therefore, according to his human
      nature, Christ should have suffered and done whatever would serve as a
      remedy for sin. The sin of man consists in cleaving to bodily things and
      neglecting spiritual goods. Therefore the Son of God in his human nature
      fittingly showed by what he did and suffered that men should consider
      temporal goods or evils as nothing, lest a disordered love for them impede
      them from being dedicated to spiritual things. Thus Christ chose poor
      parents, although perfect in virtue, lest anyone glory in mere nobility of
      flesh and in the wealth of his parents. He led a poor life to teach us to
      despise riches. He lived without titles or office so as to withdraw men
      from a disordered desire for these things. He underwent labour, thirst,
      hunger and bodily afflictions so that men would not be fixed on pleasure
      and delights and be drawn away from the good of virtue because of the
      hardships of this life. In the end he underwent death, so that no one
      would desert the truth because of fear of death. And lest anyone fear a
      shameful death for the sake of the truth, he chose the most horrible kind
      of death, that of the cross. Thus it was fitting that the Son of God made
      man should suffer and by his example provoke men to virtue, so as to
      verify what Peter said (1 Pet 2:21): "Christ suffered for you, and left an
      example for you to follow in his steps."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, because not only good conduct and avoiding sins is necessary for
      salvation, but also the knowledge of truth so as to avoid error, it was
      necessary for the restoration of the human race that the only-begotten
      Word of God who assumed a human nature should ground people in truth by a
      sure knowledge of it. Truth taught by men is not so firmly believed,
      because man can deceive. Only by God can knowledge of the truth be
      confirmed without any doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Son of God made man had to propose the teaching of divine truth to
      men, showing them that it came from God and not from man. He did this by
      many miracles. Since he did things that only God can do, such as raising
      the dead, giving sight to the blind etc., people had to believe that he
      spoke with God's authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who were present could see his miracles, but later generations might
      say they were made up. Therefore Divine Wisdom provided a remedy against
      this in Christ's state of weakness. For if he were rich, powerful and
      established in high dignity, it could be thought that his teaching and his
      miracles were received on account of his favour and human power. So to
      make the work of divine power apparent, he chose everything that was
      rejected and low in the world, a poor mother and a poor life, illiterate
      disciples and messengers, and allowed himself to be rebuked and condemned
      even to death by the magnates of this world. This made it apparent that
      his miracles and teaching were not received because of human power, but
      should be attributed to divine power. Thus in what he did or suffered,
      human weakness and divine power were joined together at the same time.
      Thus at his nativity he was wrapped in cloth and put in a manger, but
      praised by the angels and adored by the Magi led by a star. He was tempted
      by the devil, but ministered to by angels. He lived without money as a
      beggar, but raised the dead and gave sight to the blind. He died fixed to
      the cross and numbered among thieves, but at his death the sun darkened,
      the earth trembled, stones split, graves opened and the bodies of the dead
      were raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore if anyone considers the great fruit of such beginnings, namely,
      the conversion of peoples over the world to Christ,
      <a href="Rationes.htm#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and wants further signs in
      order to believe, he must be considered harder than a stone, since at
      Christ's death even stones were shattered. Thus the Apostle says (1 Cor
      1:18): "The message of the cross is folly for those who are on the way to
      ruin, but for those of us who are on the road to salvation it is the power
      of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a related point we should make here. The same reason of
      Providence which led the Son of God made man to suffer weakness in
      himself, let him to desire his disciples, whom he established as ministers
      of human salvation, to be abject in the world. Thus he did not choose the
      well educated and noble, but illiterate and ignoble men, that is, poor
      fishermen. Sending them to work for the salvation of men, he commanded
      them to observe poverty, to suffer persecutions and insults, and even to
      undergo death for the truth; this was so that their preaching might not
      seem fabricated for the sake of earthly comfort, and that the salvation of
      the world might not be attributed to human wisdom or power, but only to
      God's wisdom and power. Thus they did not lack divine power to work
      miracles as they appeared abject according to the world. For the
      restoration of man it was necessary for men to learn not to trust proudly
      in themselves, but in God. For the perfection of human justice requires
      that man should subject himself totally to God, from whom he also hopes to
      gain every good, and should thank him for what he has received. In order
      to train his disciples to despise the present goods of this world and to
      sustain all sorts of adversity even to death, there was no better way than
      for Christ to suffer and die. Thus he himself told them (Jn 15:20): "If
      they persecuted me, they will persecute you too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we must observe that in the order of justice sin should be punished
      by a penalty. We see how cases of injustice are handled in human courts,
      that the judge takes from the one who has too much through grabbing what
      belongs to another and gives it to the one who has less. Anyone who sins
      over-indulges his appetite, and in satisfying it transgresses the order of
      reason and of divine law. For that person to be brought back to the order
      of justice something must be taken from what he wants; that is done by
      punishing him or by taking the goods he wanted to have or by imposing the
      bad things he refused to suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This restoration of justice by penalty sometimes is done by the will of
      the one who is punished, when he imposes the penalty on himself so as to
      return to justice. Other times it is done against his will, and in that
      case he does not return to a state of justice, but justice is carried out
      in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole human race was subject to sin. To be restored to the state of
      justice, there would have to be a penalty which man would take upon
      himself in order to fulfil the order of divine justice. But no mere man
      could satisfy God sufficiently by accepting some voluntary punishment,
      even for his own sin, to say nothing of the sin of the whole human race.
      For when man sins he transgresses the law of God and tries, were he able,
      to do injury to the God of infinite majesty. The greater the person
      offended, the greater the crime; we see, for instance, that someone who
      strikes a soldier is punished more than someone who strikes a farmer, and
      much more if he strikes a king or prince. Therefore a sin committed
      against the law of God is somehow an infinite offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again we must observe that the dignity of the person making reparation is
      also to be considered. For example, one word of a king asking for pardon
      of an offence is considered greater than if someone lower went on his
      knees and showed any other sign of humiliation to beg pardon from the one
      who suffered the injury. But no mere man has the infinite dignity required
      to satisfy justly an offence against God. Therefore there had to be a man
      of infinite dignity who would undergo the penalty for all so as to satisfy
      fully for the sins of the whole world. Therefore the only-begotten Word of
      God, true God and Son of God, assumed a human nature and willed to suffer
      death in it so as to purify the whole human race indebted by sin. Thus
      Peter says (1 Pet 3:18): "Christ himself died once and for all for sins,
      the upright for the sake of the guilty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore it was not fitting, as Muslims think, for God to wipe away human
      sins without satisfaction, or even to have never permitted man to fall
      into sin. That would first be contrary to the order of justice, and
      secondly to the order of human nature, by which man has free will and can
      choose good or evil. God's Providence does not destroy the nature and
      order of things, but preserves them. So God's wisdom was most evident in
      his preserving the order of justice and of nature, and at the same time
      mercifully providing man a saving remedy in the incarnation and death of
      his Son.<br />

          Christ"</font
        ></strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Since people are cleansed of sin through the suffering and death of
      Christ, in order to preserve constantly in us the memory of such an
      immense gift, when the time of his suffering was drawing near, the Son of
      God left his faithful a memorial of his suffering and death that would be
      constantly recalled, giving his disciples his own body and blood under the
      forms of bread and wine. The Church of Christ continues celebrating this
      memorial of his venerable suffering up to the present day all over the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone even slightly instructed in the Christian religion can see how
      unreasonably unbelievers ridicule this sacrament. For we do not say that
      the body of Christ is cut into parts and distributed for consumption by
      the faithful in the Sacrament, so that it would have to run out, even if
      his body were as big as a mountain, as they say. But we say that by the
      conversion of bread into the body of Christ the very body of Christ exists
      in this Sacrament of the Church and is eaten by the faithful. Because the
      body of Christ is not divided, but something is changed into it, there is
      no way that by eating it its quantity could be reduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if an unbeliever wants to say that this conversion is impossible, let
      him think of the omnipotence of God. He will agree that by the power of
      nature one thing can be converted into another by taking on another form.
      Thus air is converted into fire when the matter which previously was under
      the form of air later becomes subject to the form of fire. Much more,
      therefore, the power of almighty God, which brings the whole substance of
      a thing into existence, can not only change something by form, as nature
      does, but also convert the whole thing, so that bread is converted into
      the body of Christ and wine into his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anyone objects to this conversion on the grounds of what appears to the
      senses, where there is no difference, let him observe that divine things
      are offered to us under the veil of visible things. That we may have the
      spiritual and divine refreshment of the body and blood of Christ, and not
      take it as ordinary food and drink, it is taken under the form of bread
      and wine; that avoids the horror of eating human flesh and drinking blood.
      Nevertheless, we do not say that the forms that appear in the Sacrament
      are just in the imagination of the viewer, as happens in magical tricks,
      because any deceit is unworthy of this Sacrament. But God, who is the
      creator of substance and accidents, can preserve sensible accidents in
      existence even when the substance is changed into something else. For he
      can produce and preserve in existence the effects of secondary causes by
      his omnipotence without secondary causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if someone does not admit the omnipotence of God, we do not attempt to
      argue with him in this work. We are here arguing against Muslims and
      others who admit the omnipotence of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are further mysteries in this Sacrament which should not be
      discussed here, since the sacred things of faith should not be exposed to
      unbelievers.<br />

    </p>
    <p>
      We must now consider the opinion of those who say there is no purgatory
      after death. Some hold this opinion by over-reaction, as happens in many
      other questions. Trying to avoid one error they fall into the contrary.
      Thus Arius wanted to avoid the error of Sabellius who merged the persons
      of the Holy Trinity, but he wound up dividing the divine essence. Likewise
      Eutyches wanted to avoid the error of Nestorius who divided the person of
      God and man in Christ, but went over to the contrary error of saying that
      he had a single divine and human nature. So some, wishing to avoid the
      error of Origen who said that the pains of Hell would eventually purify
      all its occupants, assert that there is no purifying pain after death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church treads carefully between contrary
      errors. It distinguishes the persons in the Trinity against Sabellius,
      without leaning towards the error of Arius, but professes only one essence
      of the persons. In the mystery of the incarnation it distinguishes the two
      natures against Eutyches, but does not join Nestorius in making two
      persons. Likewise, regarding the state of souls after death, it professes
      that those who leave this life without mortal sin and have the gift of
      love may undergo some purifying pain, but it does not agree with Origen in
      saying that all pain after death is purifying; rather it professes that
      those who die with mortal sin are tortured with the devil and his angels
      with eternal punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the truth of the matter, we must first of all say that those who
      die in mortal sin are immediately carried away to hellish punishment. This
      is clear from the Gospel; thus Luke states the words of the Lord (16:22)
      that "the rich man died and was buried; in hell he looked up..." He
      describes his own torture (v. 24): "for I am in agony in these flames."
      Job also says of the wicked (21:13): "They enjoy life and then go down
      suddenly to Sheol." See also Job 22:17: "They say to God, 'Go away from
      us'." Not only are the wicked in hell for their own sins, but before the
      suffering of Christ even the just went down at death to the underworld for
      the sin of our first parent. Thus Jacob said (Gen 37:35): "I will go down
      to Sheol in mourning." Thus Christ himself at death went down to the
      underworld, as the Creed says, and as the Prophet [David] foretold (Ps
      16:10): "You will not leave my soul in Sheol," which Peter, in Acts
      (2:25), applies to Christ. Christ however went to the underworld in a
      different way, not laden with sin but alone "free among the dead" [Latin
      for Ps 88:6]; he descended to disarm principalities and powers (1 Cor
      15:24) and take captives (Ps 68:19), as Zechariah predicted (9:11): "As
      for you, because of the blood of your covenant I have released your
      prisoners from the pit in which there is no water."
    </p>
    <p>
      But because God's acts of compassion are above all his works, we believe
      still more that those who die without stain receive immediately the reward
      due to them for eternity. This is proven by clear texts; with reference to
      the sufferings of the saints, the Apostle says (2 Cor 5:1): "We are well
      aware that when the tent that houses us on earth is folded up, there is a
      house for us from God, not made by human hands but everlasting, in the
      heavens." These words appear at first sight to indicate that as soon as
      the mortal body is dissolved man is clothed with heavenly glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to make the meaning plainer, let us examine the following verses.
      Since he referred to two things: the dissolution of our earthly dwelling
      and the gaining of a heavenly dwelling, he shows how man's desire regards
      each, with an explanation of each. So, regarding the desire for a heavenly
      dwelling, he says (v. 2) that "we groan" because we are delayed from
      reaching our desire, and "we yearn to be clothed over with our heavenly
      dwelling." These words indicate that the heavenly dwelling he is talking
      about is not something separated from man, but something attached to him.
      For we do not say that a man puts on a house, but a garment; rather we say
      that someone dwells in a house. So, when he combines the two concepts "to
      be clothed over with our heavenly dwelling", he shows that what we first
      desire is something attached, because it is put on, and it is also
      containing and exceeding, since it is dwelt in. Exactly what this object
      of desire is the following verses make clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because he did not simply say "clothed" but "clothed over", he explains
      this (v. 3): "provided we are found clothed and not naked," as if to say:
      If the soul puts on an eternal dwelling without taking off its earthly
      dwelling, the acquisition of that dwelling is being clothed over. But
      because the earthly dwelling must be taken off in order to put on the
      heavenly one, we cannot speak simply of being clothed over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore someone could ask the Apostle: Why did you say "yearning to be
      clothed over"? He answers that by saying (v. 4): "While we are in our
      present tent," that is, clothed with our present transitory dwelling, not
      having a permanent dwelling, "we groan, weighed down" as by something
      happening against our desire, since by our natural desire "we do not wish
      to be stripped naked" from our earthly tent, "but to be clothed over with
      a heavenly tent, so that what is mortal may be absorbed by life," that is,
      that we may go into immortal life without tasting death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone could again ask the Apostle why, as it seems reasonable, should we
      want not to be stripped of our earthly dwelling which is natural to us in
      order to put on a heavenly dwelling? He answers (v. 5): "God has designed
      us for this," that is, to desire heavenly things. How God does this, he
      adds: "He has given us the Spirit as a pledge." For the Holy spirit, whom
      we receive from God, makes us certain and eager to gain our heavenly
      dwelling, like claiming something owed to us because of the pledge we
      hold. Because of this certainty we are lifted up to desire a heavenly
      dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we have two kinds of desire: the first is natural, which is not to
      abandon our earthly dwelling, and the second is from grace, which is to
      gain a heavenly dwelling. But both desires cannot be fulfilled, since we
      cannot reach our heavenly dwelling without leaving our earthly one. So
      with a firm trust and boldness we prefer the desire that comes from grace
      to our natural desire, and wish to leave our earthly dwelling and go to
      our heavenly one. That is what he adds (vv. 6-8): "Therefore we continue
      to be confident. We know that while we dwell in the body we are away from
      the Lord. We walk by faith, not by sight. I repeat, we are full of
      confidence and would much rather be away from the body and at home with
      the Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now clear that the Apostle meant the corruptible body by the term
      "the tent that houses us on earth"; this body is like a garment to the
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also clear that what he meant by "a house not made by human hands,
      but everlasting in the heavens" is God himself, whom men put on or dwell
      in, when they are present to him face to face, that is, seeing him as he
      is. But they are on the road, away from him, when they hold by faith what
      they do not yet see. Therefore the saints desire to travel away from the
      body, that their souls may be separated from their bodies by death, so
      that, having left the body, they may be present to the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is therefore clear that the souls of the saints, separated from the
      body, have reached their heavenly dwelling. Therefore the glory of holy
      souls, which consists in the vision of God, is not deferred to the day of
      judgement when bodies are raised. This is also clear from what the Apostle
      says to the Philippians (1:23): "I long to be freed from this life and to
      be with Christ." This desire would be frustrated if, after his body was
      dissolved, he was not with Christ, who is in heaven. The Lord also clearly
      said to the penitent thief on the cross (Lk 23:43): "Today you will be
      with me in paradise," meaning by paradise the enjoyment of glory. So it is
      not to be believed that Christ defers the reward of his faithful, as far
      as the glory of their souls is concerned, until the resurrection of the
      body. The words of the Lord (Jn 14:2), "In my Father's house there are
      many places to live in," refer to different degrees of rewards given to
      the saints in heavenly happiness, not outside the heavenly home but in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this it also follows that there is a place for purifying souls after
      death. Many passages of Scripture clearly say that no one can enter
      heavenly glory with any stain. Speaking about participation in Divine
      Wisdom, Wisdom 7:25 says: "Nothing impure can find its way into her." But
      heavenly happiness consists in the perfect participation in Wisdom, by
      which we see God face to face. Therefore those who are brought into this
      must be completely without stain. This is also supposed in Isaiah, 35:8:
      "It will be called the Sacred Way; the unclean will not be allowed to use
      it," and in Revelation 21:7: "Nothing unclean may come into it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people, at the hour of death, happen to have some stains of sin which
      do not merit the eternal damnation of hell, such as venial sins, like idle
      words etc. Those who die with such stains cannot go straight to heavenly
      happiness, although they would if they did not have these stains, as we
      have seen. Therefore, after death they at least suffer a delay in entering
      glory. There is no reason why our objectors should concede that souls
      after death suffer this penalty rather than any other, especially since
      the lack of the vision of God and separation from him is a greater pain,
      even for those in hell, than the punishment of fire which they suffer
      there. Therefore the souls of those who die with venial sins undergo a
      purifying fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      If someone says that these venial sins will wait to be purified by the
      fire that will burn up the world before the coming of the Judge, this
      cannot hold. It has been shown above that the souls of the saints which
      have no stain gain heavenly happiness as soon as they die, and at the same
      time souls with venial sins cannot enter glory. In that case their
      entrance into glory would be deferred because of venial sins until the day
      of judgement, which is most improbable, since this would be too great a
      penalty for light sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason for purgatory is that some people did not finish making due
      penance for the [mortal] sins they repented of before death, and it would
      not befit God's justice to let them off; otherwise those who die suddenly
      would be in a better position than those who spend a long time in this
      life doing penance. Therefore they suffer something after death. This
      cannot be in hell, where people are punished for mortal sins, since the
      mortal sins of these people have been forgiven by their repentance. Nor
      would it be fitting, as a penalty, to defer the glory due to them until
      the day of judgement. Therefore there should be some temporal purifying
      punishment after this life before the day of judgement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Church rites established by the Apostles agree with this. For the whole
      Church prays for the faithful departed. It is clear that it does not pray
      for those who are in hell, where there is no redemption, nor for those who
      have reached heavenly glory. It remains therefore that there are some
      temporal purifying pains after this life, for whose remission the Church
      prays. Thus even the Apostle says (1 Cor 3:13-15): "Each person's
      handiwork will be shown for what it is. The Day which dawns in fire will
      make it clear and the fire itself will test the quality of each person's
      work. The one whose work stands up to it will be given his wages; the one
      whose work is burnt down will suffer the loss of it, though he himself
      will be saved, but only as one fleeing through fire." This cannot be
      understood of the fire of hell, because those who suffer that fire are not
      saved. Therefore it must be understood of a purifying fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be said that this should be understood of the fire that will
      precede the coming of the Judge, especially since the passage says, "The
      Day will make it clear", while the day of the Lord is understood as the
      day of his last coming for the universal judgement of the whole world, as
      the Apostle says in 1 Thessalonians (5:2): "The Day of the Lord is going
      to come like a thief in the night." In reply we must point out that as the
      day of judgement is called the day of the Lord, because it is the day of
      his coming for the universal judgement of the whole world, so the day of
      each person's death can also be called the day of the Lord, because then
      Christ comes to each person to reward or condemn him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With reference to rewarding the good, Christ said to his disciples (Jn
      14:3): "After I have gone and prepared you a place, I shall return to take
      you to myself." With reference to the damnation of the evil it is said in
      Revelation 2:5: "Repent and behave as you did at first, or else, if you
      will not repent, I shall come to you and take your lamp-stand from its
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore the day of the Lord on which the universal judgement takes place
      will be revealed in the fire which will precede the coming of the Judge,
      when the reprobate will be pulled to judgement, and the just who are left
      alive will be purified, but the day of the Lord on which he will judge
      each person at his death will be revealed by a fire that will purify the
      good and condemn the wicked.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore it is clear that there is a purgatory after death.<br /></p>

          >Chapter 10: That divine predestination does not impose necessity on
          human acts</font
        ></strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Last of all we come to the question whether, because of divine ordination
      or predestination, human acts become necessary. This question requires
      caution so as to defend the truth and avoid falsity or error.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is erroneous to say that human acts and events escape God's
      fore-knowledge and ordination. It is no less erroneous to say that God's
      fore-knowledge and ordination imposes necessity on human acts; otherwise
      free will would be removed, as well as the value of taking counsel, the
      usefulness of laws, the care to do what is right and the justice of
      rewards and punishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must observe that God knows things differently from man. Man is subject
      to time and therefore knows things temporally, seeing some things as
      present, recalling others as past, and fore-seeing others as future. But
      God is above the passage of time, and his existence is eternal. So his
      knowledge is not temporal, but eternal. Eternity is compared to time as
      something indivisible to what is continuous. Thus in time there is a
      difference of successive parts according to before and after, but eternity
      has no before and after, because eternal things are free from any change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus eternity is totally at once, just as a point lacks parts that are
      distinct in location. For a point can be compared to a line in two ways:
      first as included in the line, whether at the beginning, middle or end,
      secondly as existing outside a line. A point within a line cannot be
      present to all the parts of the line, but in different parts of the line
      different points must be designated. But a point outside the line can view
      all parts of the line equally, as in a circle, whose central point is
      indivisible and faces all the parts of the circumference and all of them
      are somehow present to it, although not to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant, which is a limit of time, is comparable to the point included
      in a line. It is not present to all parts of time, but in different parts
      of time different instances are designated. Eternity is something like the
      point outside a line, like the centre of a circle. Since it is simple and
      indivisible, it comprehends the whole passage of time and each part of
      time is equally present to it, although one part of time follows another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus God, who looks at everything from the high point of eternity, views
      as present the whole passage of time and everything that is done in time.
      Therefore, when I see Socrates sitting, my knowledge is infallible and
      certain, but no necessity is imposed on Socrates to be seated. Thus God,
      seeing everything that is past, future or present to us as present to
      himself, knows all this infallibly and certainly, yet without imposing on
      contingent things any necessity of existing.

      This comparison can be accepted, if we compare the passage of time to
      travel over a road. If someone is on a road over which many people pass,
      he sees those who are just ahead of him, but cannot certainly know those
      who come after him. But if someone stands in a high place where he can see
      the whole road, he sees at once all who are moving on the road. Thus man,
      who is in time, cannot see the whole course of time at once, but only
      thinks that just in front of him, namely the present, and a few things of
      the past, but he cannot know future things for certain. But God, from the
      high point of his eternity sees with certitude and as present all that is
      done through the whole course of time, without imposing necessity on
      contingent things.

      Just as God's knowledge does not impose necessity on contingent things,
      neither does his ordination, by which he providentially orders the
      universe. For he orders things the way he acts on things; his ordination
      does not violate but brings to effect by his power what he planned in his
      Wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the action of God's power, we should observe that he acts in
      everything and moves each single thing to its actions according to the
      manner proper to each thing, so that some things, by divine motion, act
      from necessity, as the motion of heavenly bodies [according to ancient
      cosmology], while others contingently, which sometimes fail in their
      proper action because of their corruptibility. A tree, for example,
      sometimes is impeded from producing fruit and an animal from generating
      offspring. Thus Divine Wisdom orders things so that they happen after the
      manner of their proper causes. In the case of man, it is natural for him
      to act freely, not forced, because rational powers can turn in opposite
      directions. Thus God orders human actions in a way that these actions are
      not subject to necessity, but come from free will.<br />

      These, then are what I can write at present about the questions you sent
      to me. They are treated in greater detail elsewhere [in the
      <em>Summa contra gentiles</em> ].
