    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It seems not, for</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. That which is had by an addition to another cannot be found in a most
    simple being, and God is most simple. Therefore, since knowledge is had by
    an addition to the essence—for life adds something to the act of existence
    and knowledge adds something to life—it seems that knowledge is not in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. The answer was given that knowledge does not add anything to God’s
    essence, since <i>knowledge</i> merely indicates a perfection God has that
    is not indicated by <i>essence.—</i> On the contrary, <i>perfection</i> is
    the name of a thing. But in God, essence and knowledge are absolutely one
    thing. The same perfection, therefore, is indicated by both words,
    <i>essence</i> and <i>knowledge.</i>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. No noun can be used of God which does not signify the entire divine
    perfection; for if it does not signify His entire perfection, it signifies
    nothing about Him, since parts are not found in God and cannot be attributed
    to Him. Now, <i>knowledge</i> does not represent His entire perfection, for
    God “is above all names which name Him,” as is stated in
    <i>The Causes.</i> Therefore, knowledge cannot be attributed to Him.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Moreover, science is the habit of conclusions, and understanding, the
    habit of principles—as is clear from what the Philosopher says. But God does
    not know anything as a conclusion: for this would mean that His intellect
    would proceed from premises to conclusions, though, as Dionysius has shown,
    this is not true even for the angels. Hence, science is not in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Whatever is known scientifically is known through something more known.
    For God, however, there is not anything more known or less known. Therefore,
    scientific knowledge cannot be in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. Algazel says that knowledge is an impression of the known in the
    intellect of the knower. But an impression is entirely alien to God, for it
    implies receptivity and composition. Therefore, knowledge cannot be
    attributed to God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. Nothing implying imperfection can be attributed to God. But knowledge
    implies imperfection, for it is regarded as a habit or first act—the
    operation of considering being regarded as second act, as is stated in
    <i>The Soul</i>. But a first act is imperfect with respect to the second
    since it is in potency to the second. Therefore, knowledge cannot be in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. The answer was that there is only actual knowledge in God.—On the
    contrary, God’s knowledge is the cause of things. Therefore, if knowledge is
    attributed to God, it existed eternally in Him; and if only actual knowledge
    is in God, He produced things from all eternity. This is false.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. Whenever there is anything which corresponds to the concept we have of
    the word <i>knowledge,</i> of it we know not only that it is but also what
    it is, for knowledge is a distinct reality. But, as Damascene says,” we
    cannot know what God is, but only that He is. Therefore, in God there is
    nothing corresponding to our concept expressed by
    <i>knowledge.</i> Knowledge, therefore, does not exist in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. Augustine states that God is not accessible to the intellect since He
    eludes every form. But knowledge is a form which the intellect conceives.
    Hence, God also eludes this form, and so there cannot be knowledge in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. To understand is more simple and of greater dignity than to know. But as
    stated in <i>The Causes</i>, when we say that God understands or is an
    intelligence, we are not naming Him with a proper noun but “with the name of
    His first effect.” Much less, then, can we use <i>knowledge</i> of God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. Quality implies a greater composition than quantity does, for quality
    inheres in a substance by means of quantity. We do not attribute anything of
    the genus of quantity to God because of His simplicity, for everything
    quantified has parts. Hence, since knowledge is in the genus of quality, it
    cannot be attributed to God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. The Epistle to the Romans (11:33) says: “O the depth of the riches of
    the wisdom and of the knowledge of God!”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. According to Anselm, we must attribute to God everything which in each
    thing it is better absolutely to have than not to have. Since knowledge is a
    perfection of this kind, it must be attributed to God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Only three things are required for knowledge: an active power in the
    knower by which he judges about things, a thing known, and the union of
    both. But in God there is the most active power possible and an essence that
    is most knowable; consequently, there is a union of both. God, therefore,
    knows in the highest degree. Our proof of the minor premise is drawn from
    the fact mentioned in <i>The Intelligences,</i> namely: “The first substance
    is light.” But light has active power most of all, as is shown from its
    diffusion and multiplication. It is, besides, highly knowable and, because
    of this, also makes other things known. Therefore, the first substance, God,
    has an active power to know and is Himself also knowable.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    All attribute knowledge to God, but in different ways. Some, not being able
    by their own intellectual power to go beyond the man er of created
    knowledge, have believed that knowledge is in God like some sort of
    disposition added to His essence, as is the case with us. This is quite
    absurd and erroneous. For, if it were true, God would not be absolutely
    simple. There would be in Him a composition of substance and accident, and,
    further, God would not be His own act of existence; for, as Boethius says:
    “What exists can share in something else, but existence itself in no way
    shares in anything else.” If God shared in knowledge as if it were a state
    added to His essence, He would not be His own act of existence, and, thus,
    He would have His origin from another who would be the cause of His
    existence. In short, He would not be God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    For this reason others have asserted that, when we attribute knowledge or
    something of the same sort to God, we postulate nothing positive in Him but
    merely designate Him as the cause of knowledge in created things. In other
    words, God is said to be a knower merely because He communicates knowledge
    to creatures. Although a partial reason for the truth of the proposition
    “God is a knower” may be that He causes truth (and Origen and Augustine seem
    to say this), it is not the whole truth for two reasons. First, by the same
    reasoning we should have to predicate of God whatever He causes in
    creatures, and so we should have to say that He moves since He causes motion
    in things. This, of course, cannot be said. Second, those attributes which
    are predicated of both causes and effects are not said to be in the causes
    because of the effects. Rather, they are said to be in the effects because
    they are found in the causes. For example, because fire is hot, it induces
    heat into the air. The converse is not true. Similarly, because the nature
    of God is to have knowledge, He communicates knowledge to us, and not the
    other way about.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Still others have said that knowledge and the like are attributed to God in
    a certain proportionate likeness, as anger, mercy, and similar passions are
    attributed to Him. For God is said to be angry in so far as He does
    something similar to what an angry man does, for He punishes. In us, this is
    the effect of anger. Properly speaking, of course, the passion of anger
    cannot be in God. In the same way, they say, God is said to be a knower
    because His effects resemble those of a knowing agent. For example, the
    works of one who has scientific knowledge proceed from determined principles
    to determined ends, and so do the divinely originated works of nature—as is
    clear from the <i>Physics.</i> But, according to this view, knowledge is
    attributed merely metaphorically to God, as are anger and other like
    things—an opinion contrary to the words of Dionysius”I and other saints.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Consequently, one must give another answer and say that, when knowledge is
    attributed to God, it signifies something which is in Him. The same is true
    of life, essence, and the like. These attributes do not differ as regards
    the reality which is signified, but only in our manner of understanding
    them. For God’s essence, life, knowledge, and whatever else of this sort
    that may be predicated of Him are all the same; but in understanding
    essence, life, and so forth in His regard, our intellect has different
    concepts for each. This does not mean that these concepts are false; for our
    intellectual conceptions are true inasmuch as they actually represent the
    thing known by a certain process of assimilation. Otherwise they would be
    false, that is, if they corresponded to nothing.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Our intellect, however, cannot represent God in the same way that it
    represents creatures; for, when it knows a creature, it conceives a certain
    form which is the likeness of the thing according to its entire perfection;
    and in this manner defines the things understood. But since God infinitely
    exceeds the power of our intellect, any form we conceive cannot completely
    represent the divine essence, but merely has, in some small measure, an
    imitation of it. Similarly, extra-mental realities imitate it somewhat, but
    imperfectly. Hence, all different things imitate God in different ways; and,
    according to different forms, they represent the one simple form of God,
    since in His form are found perfectly united all the perfections that are
    found, distinct and multiple, among creatures. This is like the properties
    of numbers, which all, in a certain sense, pre-exist in unity, and like all
    the individual authorities of royal officials, which are all united in the
    authority of the king. If there were anything that could perfectly represent
    God, that thing would be unique, for it would represent Him in one way and
    according to one form. For this reason, there is in God only one Son, who is
    the perfect image of the Father.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Accordingly, our intellect represents the divine perfection by means of
    different conceptions, for each one of them is imperfect. If one were
    perfect, it would be the only one, just as there is only one Word in the
    divine intellect. There are, therefore, many conceptions in our intellect
    that represent the divine essence, and the divine intellect corresponds to
    each one of these as a thing corresponds to an imperfect image of itself.
    Thus, even though we have several intellectual conceptions about one thing,
    they are all true. Moreover, since names do not signify things without the
    mediation of the intellect, as is pointed out in <i>Interpretation,”</i> the
    intellect applies several names to one thing according to the different ways
    in which it understands it, or (what comes to the same thing) according to
    different formal aspects. To all of these, however, there corresponds
    something in reality.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Knowledge is not had by an addition to being, except in so far as our
    intellect grasps someone’s knowledge and essence as distinct; for addition
    presupposes distinction. In God, knowledge and essence are not really
    distinct, as is clear from our discussion. They are merely conceived in this
    way. Therefore, knowledge is not in God by an addition to His essence,
    except according to our way of understanding.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. One cannot correctly say that knowledge in God signifies a perfection
    other than His essence. It is merely signified as though it were another
    perfection, since our intellect applies to Him the names referred to from
    the different concepts we have of Him.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Since names represent concepts, a name signifies the totality of a thing
    in direct proportion to the intellect’s understanding of it. Our intellect
    can understand the whole of God, but not wholly. With God, one must know the
    whole or nothing at all, since in Him there is no question of part and
    whole. I say “not wholly,” however, since the intellect does not know Him
    perfectly in so far as He is knowable by His very nature. Thus, our
    knowledge is like that of a man who knows with probability the conclusion,
    “The diameter is asymmetric to the side,” merely because all men assert it.
    He does not know this conclusion wholly, since he does not arrive at the
    perfect manner of knowing with which it is capable of being grasped. Yet he
    knows the entire conclusion and is ignorant of no part of it. So, too, the
    names which are applied to God signify the whole God, but not wholly.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. What is in God without imperfection is found with some defect in
    creatures. Hence, if we attribute to God something found in creatures, we
    must entirely remove everything that smacks of imperfection so that only
    what is perfect will remain; for it is only according to its perfection that
    a creature imitates God. I point out, therefore, that our scientific
    knowledge contains both some perfection and some imperfection. Its certitude
    pertains to its perfection, for what is known scientifically is known with
    certainty. To its imperfection belongs its progression from principles to
    the conclusions contained in that science; for this progression happens only
    because the intellect, in knowing the premises, knows the conclusions only
    potentially. If it actually knew the conclusions, there would be no need of
    it to go further, since motion is simply the passage from potency to act.
    Knowledge is said to be in God, therefore, because of its certitude about
    things known, but not because of the progression mentioned above, for, as
    Dionysius says, this is not found even in angels.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. If we take into consideration the manner proper to God as a knower, there
    is nothing more known or less known in God, because He sees all with the
    same intuition. If we consider the condition of the things known, however,
    He knows some to be more knowable in themselves and some less knowable; for
    example, of all the things He knows, the most knowable is His own essence,
    through which He knows everything—not by a progression, however, since by
    seeing His essence He simultaneously sees all things. If this order of
    things known in the divine cognition is considered, the notion of science
    can also be verified in God, for He knows all things principally in their
    Cause.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. That statement of Algazel is to be understood of our knowledge, which is
    acquired by the impression upon our souls of the likenesses of things. The
    opposite is true of God’s cognition, for it is from His intellect that forms
    flow into creatures. Our knowledge is the impressing of things in our souls;
    but the forms of things are the impressing of the divine knowledge in
    things.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. The knowledge posited of God is not like a habit but rather like an act,
    since He always actually knows all things.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. Effects proceed from acting causes according to the condition of the
    causes. Hence, every effect which proceeds by reason of kno4ledge follows
    the determination of that knowledge, which limits its conditions. Therefore,
    the things which have God’s knowledge as their cause proceed only when it
    has been determined by God that they shall proceed. Consequently, it is not
    necessary that things actually exist from eternity, even though God’s
    knowledge is actual from all eternity.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. The intellect is said to know what a thing is when it defines that thing,
    that is, when it conceives some form of the thing which corresponds to it in
    all respects. From our previous discussion, it is clear that whatever our
    intellect conceives of God falls short of being a representation of Him.
    Consequently, the quiddity of God Himself remains forever hidden from us.
    The most we can know of God during our present life is that He transcends
    everything that we can conceive of Him—as is clear from Dionysius.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. God is said to elude every form of our intellect, not because there is
    no form of our intellect that can represent Him at all, but because there is
    no form that can represent Him perfectly.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. As is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i>: “An intelligible character
    signified by a noun is a definition. Hence, the name of a thing is proper if
    its meaning is its definition. Now, since no intelligible character
    signified by a name defines God Himself, no name we apply to God is proper
    to Him. It is proper rather to the creature defined by the character
    signified by the name. These names, though the names of creatures, are
    attributed to God, however, in so far as a likeness of Him is found in some
    way in creatures.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    17. The knowledge attributed to God is not a quality. Furthermore, a quality
    that follows upon quantity is a bodily quality—not a spiritual quality, as
    knowledge is.

        1. A knower is related to the thing known because of his knowledge. Now,
        as Boethius says: “The essence accounts for the divine unity, and the
        relations account for the multiplicity of the Trinity of Persons.”’ In
        God, therefore, the thing known must be personally distinct from the
        knower. Furthermore, the distinction of Persons in God will not permit a
        reciprocal predication—the Father is not said to have generated Himself
        because He generated the Son. Consequently, we cannot grant that God
        knows Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. In <i>The Causes</i> we read: “Everyone knowing his own essence
        returns to it by a complete return. But God does not return to His
        essence, since He never leaves it; and there cannot be a return if there
        has been no departure. God, therefore, does not know His own essence and
        does not know Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Knowledge is an assimilation of a knower to a thing known. But
        nothing is similar to itself, for, as Hilary says: “likeness is not
        referred to oneself. Hence, God does not know Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Scientific knowledge is only about universals. But God is not a
        universal, for every universal is bad by abstraction. There can be no
        abstraction from God, however, since He is perfectly simple. Hence, God
        does not know Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. If God knew Himself scientifically, He would understand Himself,
        since understanding is more simple than scientific knowledge and, for
        this reason, is the more to be attributed to God. But God does not
        understand Himself; hence, He does not know Himself scientifically.
        Proof of the minor premise: Augustine says: “Whatever understands itself
        comprehends itself. However, only finite being can be comprehended, as
        Augustine clearly shows in the same passage. Therefore, God does not
        understand Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Augustine argues as follows: “Our intellect does not wish to be
        infinite (although it is able so to wish), since it desires to know
        itself.” Hence, what wishes to know itself does not wish to be infinite.
        But God wishes to be infinite, since He is infinite; for, if He were
        something He did not wish to be, He would not be supremely happy.
        Consequently, He does not wish to be known to Himself and, hence, does
        not know Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The answer was given that, although God is simply infinite and wills
        to be such, He is not, however, infinite but finite to Himself, and so
        does not will that He be infinite.—On the contrary, as is pointed out in
        the <i>Physics</i>, something is said to be infinite if it is
        untraversable, finite if it is traversable. But, as is proved in the
        <i>Physics</i>, the infinite cannot be traversed by means of either a
        finite or another infinite being. Therefore, although God is infinite,
        He cannot be finite to Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. What is a good to God is simply good. Therefore, what is finite to
        God is simply finite. But God is not simply finite. Hence, He is not
        finite to Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. God knows Himself only in so far as He enters into a relation with
        Himself. Therefore, if He were finite to Himself, He would know Himself
        in a finite manner; but, since He is infinite, He would be knowing
        Himself other than He is and, consequently, have false knowledge of
        Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Of those who know God, one knows Him more than another, according as
        hils manner of cognition surpasses that of the other. But God knows
        Himself infinitely more than any one else knows Him. Hence, His manner
        of knowing is infinite, He knows Himself infinitely, and is not finite
        to Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. St. Augustine proves that one Person cannot understand a thing more
        than another can. He argues as follows: “Whoever knows a thing otherwise
        than as it is, is deceived, and anyone who is deceived about a thing
        does not understand it. Hence, whoever understands anything otherwise
        than as it is does not understand it; for nothing can be understood in
        any other way than as it is.” Since a thing exists in one manner, it is
        known in one manner by all. Hence, no one understands a thing more than
        another does. Therefore, if God were to understand Himself, He would not
        understand Himself more than others understand Him. Thus, in some
        respect a creature would be equal to his Creator; this, however, would
        be absurd.

        When it is said that a being knows itself, it is implicitly said to be
        both the knower and the known. Hence, in order to consider what kind of
        knowledge God has of Himself, we have to see what kind of a nature it is
        that can be both knower and known.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Note, therefore, that a thing is perfect in two ways. First, it is
        perfect with respect to the perfection of its act of existence, which
        belongs to it according to its own species. But, since the specific act
        of existence of one thing is distinct from the specific act of existence
        of another, in every created thing of this kind, the perfection falls
        short of absolute perfection to the extent that that perfection is found
        in other species. Consequently, the perfection of each individual thing
        considered in itself is imperfect, being a part of the perfection of the
        entire universe, which arises from the sum total of the perfections of
        all individual things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In order that there might be some remedy for this imperfection, another
        kind of perfection is to be found in created things. It consists in
        this, that the perfection belonging to one thing is found in another.
        This is the perfection of a knower in so far as he knows; for something
        is known by a knower by reason of the fact that the thing known is, in
        some fashion, in the possession of the knower. Hence, it is said in
        <i>The Soul</i> that the soul is, “in some manner, all things,” since
        its nature is such that it can know all things. In this way it is
        possible for the perfection of the entire universe to exist in one
        thing. The ultimate perfection which the soul can attain, therefore, is,
        according to the philosophers, to have delineated in it the entire order
        and causes of the universe. This they held to be the ultimate end of
        man. We, however, hold that it consists in the vision of God; for, as
        Gregory says: “What is there that they do not see who see Him who sees
        all things?” Moreover, the perfection of one thing cannot be in another
        according to the determined act of existence which it has in the thing
        itself. Hence, if we wish to consider it in so far as it can be in
        another, we must consider it apart from those things which determine it
        by their very nature. Now, since forms and perfections of things are
        made determinate by matter, a thing is knowable in so far as it is
        separated from matter For this reason, the subject in which these
        perfections are received must be immaterial; for, if it were material,
        the perfection would be received in it according to a determinate act of
        existence. It would, accordingly, not be in the intellect in a state in
        which it is knowable, that is, in the way in which the perfection of one
        thing can be in another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, those ancient philosophers erred who asserted that like is known
        by like, meaning by this that the soul, which knows all things, is
        materially constituted of all things: its earth knows the earth, its
        water knows water, and so forth. They thought that the perfection of the
        thing known had the same determined act of existence in the knower as it
        had in its own nature. But the form of the thing known is not received
        in this way in the knower. As the Commentator remarks, forms are not
        received in the possible intellect in the same way in which they are
        received in first matter, for a thing must be received by a knowing
        intellect in an immaterial way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For this reason, we observe, a nature capable of knowing is found in
        things in proportion to their degree of immateriality. Plants and things
        inferior to plants can receive nothing in an immaterial way.
        Accordingly, they are entirely lacking in the power of knowing, as is
        clear from <i>The Soul</i>. A sense, however, can receive species
        without matter although still under the conditions of matter; but the
        intellect receives its species entirely purified of such conditions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There is likewise a hierarchy among knowable things; for, as the
        Commentator says, material things are intelligible only because we make
        them intelligible; they are merely potentially intelligible and are made
        actually intelligible by the light of the agent intellect, just as
        colors are made actually visible by the light of the sun. But immaterial
        things are intelligible in themselves. Hence, although less known to us,
        they are better known in the order of nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Since God, being entirely free of all potentiality, is at the extreme of
        separation from matter, it follows that He is most knowing and most
        knowable. It follows, too, that the knowability of His nature is
        directly proportioned to the act of existence which it exercises.
        Finally, because God is by reason of the fact that He possesses His own
        nature, it follows that God knows to the extent that He possesses His
        nature as one most knowing. For this reason Avicenna says: “He Himself
        knows and apprehends Himself because His own quiddity, being completely
        stripped (that is, of matter), is that of a thing perfectly identified
        with Himself.”

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. In God, the Trinity of Persons gets its plurality from the real
        relations in Him, namely, the relations of origin. When one says “God
        knows Himself,” the relation connoted is not a real relation but a
        rational relation, for, whenever a thing is referred to itself, the
        relation is not real but merely rational. A real relation demands two
        terms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The dictum stating that one who knows himself returns to his essence
        is metaphorical. For, as shown in the <i>Physics</i>, there is no motion
        in intellection, and hence, properly speaking, no departure or return.
        Intellection is said to be a progression or movement to the extent that
        in it one passes from one thing known to another. In us, this takes
        place by a sort of discourse; and so, when the soul knows itself, there
        is a departure from the soul and a return to it. For the act, going out
        from the soul, first terminates in the object. Then one reflects upon
        the act, and finally upon the power and the essence, in so far as acts
        are known from their object, and powers by their acts. In divine
        cognition, however, there is, as was pointed out above, no progression
        from the known to the unknown. Nevertheless, from the point of view of
        the thing known, one can find a certain cycle in God’s knowledge; for in
        knowing His own essence He beholds all other things, and in these things
        He sees a likeness of His own essence. Hence, in some way He may be said
        to return to His own essence—not, however, in the sense that He knows
        His essence only from other things, as is the case with our soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Note, however, that in <i>The Causes</i> the return to one’s own essence
        is called the very subsistence of a thing in itself; for non-subsistent
        forms are, as it were, poured out upon something other than themselves,
        and are not in possession of themselves. But subsistent forms reach out
        to other things, perfecting them and influencing them—in such a way,
        however, that they still retain their immanence and self-possession. In
        this way, God returns to His essence in the highest degree, for He
        provides for all, and, because of this providence, in a sense He goes
        forth and out into all things, although in Himself He remains unmoved
        and uncontaminated by anything else.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. A likeness which is a real relation demands a distinction of things.
        If it is merely a conceptual relation, a distinction of reason between
        the things which are similar is sufficient.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. A universal is intelligible in direct proportion to its separation
        from matter. Hence, those things which have not been separated from
        matter by an act of our intellect but are, in themselves, free from all
        matter, are most knowable. Consequently, God is most knowable, even
        though He is not a universal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. God knows, understands, and comprehends Himself, although, absolutely
        speaking, He is infinite. He is not infinite privatively—as a quantity
        is infinite, having part after part <i>ad infinitum.</i> If such an
        infinite had to be known according to the formal character of its
        infinity, one could never comprehend it; one could never come to its
        end, for it does not have an end. But God is said to be negatively
        infinite since His essence is not limited by anything. Now, every form
        received in a subject is limited according to the capacity of the
        subject; but since the divine act of existence is not received in a
        subject, for He is His own act of existence, His act of existence is
        infinite and, for that very reason, His essence is said to be infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The knowing power of every created intellect is finite, since it is
        received in some subject. Consequently, our intellect cannot come to
        know God as clearly as He is capable of being known. Accordingly, our
        intellect cannot comprehend Him, for it cannot attain that fullness of
        knowledge which is the meaning of <i>comprehend,</i> as was mentioned
        above. But the divine essence and its knowing power possess the same
        infinity, and God’s knowledge is just as powerful as His essence is
        great. Consequently, He attains a perfect knowledge of Himself and is
        thus said to have comprehensive knowledge—not because such comprehension
        imposes some limits on the thing known, but rather because the knowledge
        is perfect and there is nothing lacking to it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Since our intellect is finite in its nature, it cannot comprehend or
        perfectly understand anything infinite. Augustine’s reasoning proceeded
        on the assumption of this limited nature. The nature of the divine
        intellect, however, is different; so the argument does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. If the word God, properly speaking, is given its full meaning, He is
        finite neither to Himself nor to others. He is said to be finite to
        Himself merely because He knows Himself as a finite intellect knows a
        finite thing; for, just as a finite intellect can attain a complete
        knowledge of a finite thing, so the divine intellect can have a complete
        knowledge of God Himself. But that characteristic of the infinite by
        which its end can never be reached is proper to a privative infinite.
        But this is entirely beside the point.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. In regard to those perfections which involve quantity, if anything in
        reference to God has a certain attribute, the consequence is that it has
        that attribute absolutely. Thus, whatever is great in reference to God
        is, as a consequence, simply great. But in regard to those terms which
        involve imperfection, the same thing does not follow. If, for instance,
        something is small in comparison with God, it is not necessarily, as a
        consequence, small absolutely. All things are, indeed, nothing in
        comparison with God, yet they are not absolutely nothing. What is good
        in the sight of God, therefore, is good absolutely; but it does not
        follow that what is finite for God is finite absolutely, because
        <i>finite</i> involves imperfection, but <i>good</i> expresses a
        perfection. In either case, however, anything which is found in the
        divine judgment to have a certain Attribute has that attribute
        absolutely.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. The statement, “God knows Himself limitedly,” can be understood in
        two ways. In the first way, <i>limitedly</i> is applied to the thing
        known, so that God would know Himself to be limited. In this sense the
        statement is incorrect, for then God’s knowledge would be false. In the
        second way, <i>limitedly</i> is applied to the knower. Then, two
        interpretations are possible. Either <i>limitedly</i> means perfectly,
        so that the knower is said to know limitedly whose knowledge attains its
        end and, in this sense, God actually does know Himself “limitedly”; or
        <i>limitedly</i> pertains to the efficacy of cognition—and in this sense
        God knows Himself, not limitedly, but infinitely, for the extent of the
        power of His cognition is the infinite itself. However, from the fact
        that He is finite to himself in the manner described, one cannot
        conclude that His knowledge of Himself is limited, except in the sense
        in which this was said to be true.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. That argument is based on the word <i>infinite</i> being taken as
        referring to the efficacy of knowledge. Consequently, it is clear that
        God does not know Himself finitely.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. The statement that one person can understand more than another may
        be taken in two ways. In the first, the word <i>more</i> refers
        primarily to the thing known. In this sense, no one of those who
        understand understands more than another of the thing understood,
        provided that it is understood; for whoever attributes more or less to
        the thing known than is in the nature of the thing is in error and does
        not, properly speaking, understand. But the word more can also be taken
        as referring to the manner in which one knows. In this sense, one
        understands more than another because he understands more clearly—as an
        angel understands more clearly than a man, and God more than an angel,
        because of a greater power of understanding. We must similarly
        distinguish another phrase assumed in this proof, that is, “to know a
        thing other than as it is.” For, if the word <i>other</i> refers
        primarily to the thing known, then no one who understands knows a thing
        other than it is; for this would be to understand it to be in some other
        way than it is. If the word otber, however, refers to the manner by
        which one knows, then everyone who understands a material thing knows it
        other than it is, because a thing having a material act of existence is
        understood only in an immaterial way.

        2. But it was said that in so far as a thing or creature is known by
        God, it is one with Him.—On the contrary, a creature is one with God
        only inasmuch as it is in Him. Hence, if God knows a creature only as it
        is one with Him, He will know it only as it is in Him, and not as it is
        in its own nature.

        3. If the divine intellect knows a creature, it knows it either through
        its essence or through something extrinsic. If it knows it through some
        extrinsic medium, then, since every medium of knowing is a perfection of
        the knower, because it is his form as knower (as is evident of the
        species of a stone in the pupil of the eye), it would follow that
        something extrinsic to God would be one of His perfections. But this is
        absurd. On the other hand, if He knows a creature through His own
        essence, since His essence is something distinct from the creature, it
        will follow that from knowing one thing He will know another. Now, every
        intellect that knows one thing from another is one which discourses and
        reasons. Consequently, there is discursive thought in the divine
        intellect, and, therefore, imperfection. But this is absurd.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The medium through which a thing is known ought to be proportionate
        to that which is known through it. But the divine essence is not
        proportionate to a creature since it infinitely surpasses it, and there
        is no proportion between the infinite and the finite. Therefore, by
        knowing His own essence, God cannot know a creature.

        Himself.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. If God knows things other than Himself, since He knows Him. self, He
        knows either Himself and other things also under the same formal aspect
        or Himself under one formal aspect and other things under another. If He
        knows both under the same formal aspect, then, since He knows Himself
        through His own essence, it follows that He knows other things through
        their essence. But this is impossible. However, if He knows one under
        one formal aspect and the other under another, then, since the knowledge
        of the knower is specified by the formal aspect under which the thing is
        known, there would be multiplicity and diversity in the divine
        cognition; but this is repugnant to the divine simplicity. Therefore,
        God does not know a creature in any way whatsoever.

        7. A creature is farther removed from God than the person of the Father
        is from the nature of the Godhead. But God does not know that He is God
        in the same act that He knows that He is the Father, for, when it is
        said that He knows He is the Father, the notion of Father is included,
        which is not included in the statement, “He knows that He is God.” Much
        more is it true, then, that, if God knows a creature, He will know
        Himself under a different formality than that under which He will know
        the creature. This, however, would be absurd, as is proved above in the
        sixth difficulty.

        8. The principles of being and of knowing are the same. But, as
        Augustine says, the Father is not the Father by the same principle that
        He is God. Therefore, the Father does not know that He is the Father by
        the same principle that He knows He is God, and much more so the Father
        does not know Himself and a creature by the same principle—if He does
        know any creatures.

        9. Knowledge is an assimilation of the knower to the thing known. But

        creatures.

        11. A creature is compared to God as a point to a line. Hence,
        Trismegistus says— “God is an intelligible sphere, whose center is
        every, where, and whose circumference is nowhere”. and by its center, as
        Alanus explains, he means a creature. Now, a line loses none of its
        quantity if a point is taken from it. Hence, the divine perfection loses
        none of its perfection if knowledge of a creature is taken from it. But
        whatever is in God pertains to His perfection, since nothing is in Him
        as an accident. Consequently, He does not have any knowledge of
        creatures.

        12. Whatever God knows He knows from eternity, since His knowledge does
        not vary. Now, whatever He knows is a being, for knowledge is only of
        being. Hence, whatever He knows existed from eternity. But no creature
        existed from eternity. Consequently, He knows no creature.

        13. Whatever is perfected by something else has a passive potency in
        regard to that thing, because perfection is, as it were, a form of that
        which is perfected. But God does not have any passive potency in
        Himself, for this is a principle of change, which is far removed from
        God. Therefore, God is not perfected by anything other than Himself.
        Now, the perfection of a knower depends on the object of his knowledge,
        for his perfection consists in his actual knowing; and this is only
        something that can be known. Therefore, God does not know anything other
        than Himself.

        to what is moved. But, as is said in the same place, just as the object
        of sense moves the sense, so the object of the intellect moves the
        intellect. Therefore, if God were to know something other than Himself,
        it would follow that something were prior to Him. But this is absurd.

        indication of this is the delight of the senses...”—as some books have
        this passage. If, therefore, God knew something other than Himself, that

        Sirach (34:2): “The man that giveth heed to lying visions is like to him
        that catcheth at a shadow and followeth after the wind.” Therefore,
        creatures are more unknown than known.

        in so far as it is compared with Him. Therefore, if a creature, as
        compared with God, is a lie and a non-being, then it is unknowable and

        But of the four causes, the efficient and final are the causes of a
        thing’s becoming. Form and matter, however, are causes of a thing’s
        existence because they enter into the thing’s constitution. God,

        Undoubtedly, it must be granted that God knows not only Himself but also
        all other things. This can be proved in the following manner. Whatever
        naturally tends toward another must have this tendency from someone
        directing it toward its end; otherwise, it would tend toward it merely
        by chance. Now, in the things of nature we find a natural appetite by
        which each and every thing tends toward its end. Hence, we must affirm
        the existence of some intellect above natural things, which has ordained
        natural things to their end and implanted in them a natural appetite or
        inclination. But a thing cannot be ordained to any end unless the thing
        itself is known, together with the end to which it is ordained. Hence,
        there must be a knowledge of natural things in the divine intellect from
        which the origin and the order of nature come. The Psalmist suggests
        this proof when he says: “He that formed the eye, doth he not consider?”
        (Psalms 93:9); for, as Rabbi Moses points out, it is as if the Psalmist
        had said: “Does He not consider the nature of the eye—who has made it to
        be proportioned to its end, which is its act of seeing?”“ But now we
        must further consider the manner by which He knows creatures.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It should be understood, therefore, that, since every agent acts to the
        extent that it is in act, that which is effected by the agent must in
        some way exist in the agent. This is the reason why every agent causes
        something similar to itself. Now, whatever is in another is in it
        according to the manner of the recipient. Hence, if the active principle
        is material, the effect is in it somehow materially, because it is, as
        it were, in a material power. If the active principle is immaterial,
        however, its effect will also be in it immaterially.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, as we have said earlier, a thing is known by another in so far as
        it is received immaterially by that other. Consequently, active material
        principles do not know their effects, because these latter do not exist
        in them in a manner in which they could be known; but in immaterial
        active principles the effects are present in a manner in which they are
        knowable, since they are there immaterially. Therefore, every immaterial
        active principle knows its own effect. This is why it is said in
        <i>The Causes</i>: “An intelligence knows what is below it in so far as
        it is its cause.” Therefore, since God is the immaterial active
        principle of things, it follows that in Him there is knowledge of
        things.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The known is a perfection of the knower, not by its substance (for
        the thing is outside the knower), but rather by the likeness by which it
        is known; for a perfection exists in the perfected—and the likeness of
        the stone, not the stone, exists in the soul. Now, the likeness of the
        thing known exists in the intellect in two ways: sometimes as something
        other than the knower himself, at other times as the very essence of the
        knower. For example, our intellect, by knowing itself, knows other
        intellects in so far as it is itself a likeness of other intellects; but
        the likeness of a stone in the intellect is not the very essence of
        intellect; in fact, this likeness is received somewhat as a form is
        received in matter. Now, this form, which is other than the intellect,
        is sometimes the cause of the thing whose likeness it is. We have an
        evident example of this in the practical intellect, whose form is the
        cause of the thing done. But sometimes this form is the effect of the
        thing, as is clearly the case with our speculative intellect when it
        receives its knowledge from things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, whenever an intellect knows a thing through a likeness which
        is not the essence of the knower, then the intellect is perfected by
        something other than itself; but if that likeness should happen to he
        the cause of the tiling, in that case the intellect will be perfected
        only by the likeness, and not at all by the thing whose likeness it is.
        For example, a house is not the perfection of the artistic conception,
        but rather the contrary. On the other hand, if the likeness is caused by
        the thing, then the perfection of the intellect will be, as it were, the
        thing in an active sense, but its likeness in a formal sense. However,
        when the likeness of the thing known is the very essence of the knower,
        the intellect is not perfected by something other than itselfexcept,
        perhaps, actively, as would be the case if its essence were produced by
        another. But because the knowledge of the divine intellect is not caused
        by things and neither the likeness by which it knows the thing nor its
        own essence is caused by another, it by no means follows from the fact
        that God knows things other than Himself that His intellect is perfected
        by something else.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. God does not know other things only inasmuch as they exist in Him, if
        <i>inasmuch as</i> refers to His knowledge from the point of view of the
        thing known, because, in regard to things, He knows not only the act of
        being which they have inasmuch as they are one with Him, but also the
        act of being which they have outside of Him, and by which they are
        distinguished from Him. However, if <i>inasmuch as</i> specifies His
        knowledge from the point of view of the knower, then it is true that God
        knows things only inasmuch as they are in Him; for He knows them from
        their likeness, which is identical in reality with Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The manner in which God knows creatures is by their existence within
        Himself. An effect existing in any efficient cause whatsoever is not
        other than that cause if there is question of a thing which is a cause
        in itself. For example, a house existing in the conception of the artist
        is not other than that conception itself; for an effect is in an active
        principle simply inasmuch as the active principle produces an effect
        similar to itself, and this active principle is the very thing by which
        the artist acts. Consequently, if some active principle acts only
        through its form, its effect is in it in so far as it has that form, and
        its effect will not exist in the principle as something distinct from
        its form. Similarly, since God acts through His essence, His effect is
        not in Him as something distinct from His essence; but it is entirely
        one with it. Therefore, His knowledge of an effect is not distinct from
        His own essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Nevertheless, from the fact that He knows His effect by knowing His own
        essence, it does not follow that there is any discursive reasoning in
        His intellect; for an intellect is said to reason from one thing to
        another only if it apprehends each by distinct apprehensions. Thus, the
        human intellect apprehends a cause and an effect by distinct acts; and
        since it knows an effect through its cause, it is said to reason from
        the cause to the effect. When, however, the knowing power is directed by
        the same act to the medium by which it knows and to the thing known,
        then there is no discursive process in knowing. For example, when sight
        knows a stone by means of the species of stone in this sense, or when it
        knows by means of a mirror a thing reflected in the mirror, it is not
        said to reason discursively; for to be directed to the likeness of a
        thing is the same as to be directed to the thing which is known through
        this likeness. It is in this manner that God knows His effects through
        His essence—just as a thing is known through its likeness. Therefore,
        with one cognition He knows Himself and other things. Dionysius agrees
        when he speaks as follows: “God does not have a proper knowledge of
        Himself and another general knowledge that comprehends all existing
        things.” Consequently, there is no discourse in God’s intellect.

        4. A thing is said to be proportionate to another in two ways. In one
        way, a proportion is noted between the two things. For example, we say
        that four is proportioned to two since its proportion to two is double.
        In the second way, they are proportioned as by a proportionality. For
        example, we say that six and eight are proportionate because, just as
        six is the double of three, so eight is the double of four; for
        proportionality is a similarity of proportions. Now, since in every
        proportion a relation is noted between those things that are said to be
        proportioned because of some definite excess of one over the other, it
        is impossible for any infinite to be proportionate to a finite by way of
        proportion. When, however, things are said to be proportionate by way of
        proportionality, their relation to each other is not considered. All
        that is considered is the similarity of the relation of two things to
        two other things. Thus, nothing prevents an infinite from being
        proportionate to an infinite; for, just as a particular finite is equal
        to a certain finite, so an infinite is equal to another infinite. In
        this way, there should be a medium that is proportionate to that which
        is known by the medium. Consequently, just as the medium is related to
        the act of demonstrating, so that which is known through the medium is
        related to the act of being demonstrated. Thus, nothing prevents the
        divine essence from being the medium by which a creature is known.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. A thing is understood intellectually in two ways. First, it is
        understood in itself, as happens when the regard of the beholder is
        shaped directly by the thing itself, which is understood or known.
        Second, a thing is seen in something else; and, when this latter is
        known, it itself is known. God, therefore, knows only Himself in
        Himself; but He does not know other things in themselves except by
        knowing His own essence. This is what the Philosopher meant when he said
        that God knows only Himself; and the following statement of Dionysius is
        quite in agreement: “God knows things that come to be, not by a
        knowledge of such things, but by His knowledge of Himself.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. If the formal aspect under which knowledge occurs is considered here
        from the point of view of the knower, then God knows Himself and other
        things under the same formal aspect; for the knower, the act of knowing,
        and the medium of knowing are all the same. But, if we consider the
        formal aspect from the point of view of the thing known, then He does
        not know Himself and other things under the same formal aspect; for the
        relation of Himself and of other things to the medium by which He knows
        is not the same; for He is the same as that medium by His essence, while
        other things are “the same” as the medium merely because of their
        resemblance to it. Therefore, He knows Himself through His essence, but
        other things through a likeness. However, that which is His essence and
        that which is the likeness of other things is the same reality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. If we consider the knower, it is entirely true that God knows that He
        is God and that He is the Father by the same act of knowing. But He does
        not know both by the same act of knowing if we consider that which is
        known; for He knows that He is God by the Godhead, and that He is the
        Father by His paternity. This latter, according to our manner of
        understanding, is not the same as the Godhead, although they are one in
        reality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. If we consider only the thing known, that which is the principle of
        its existence is also the principle of its being known, because a thing
        is knowable by means of its principles. But if we consider the knower,
        then that by which a thing is known is a likeness of the thing or of its
        principles. This likeness is not a principle of the existence of the
        thing, except in practical knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. There are two ways of considering the mutual likeness between two
        things. First, we can consider them inasmuch as they agree in a common
        nature. Such a likeness between the knower and the known is not
        required; indeed, we sometimes see that the smaller the likeness, the
        sharper the cognition. For example, there is less resemblance between
        the intellectual likeness of a stone and the stone than there is between
        the sense likeness and the stone, for the intellectual likeness is
        farther removed from matter; yet the intellect knows more profoundly
        than sense.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Secondly, the likeness between two things can be considered from the
        point of view of representation. Such a likeness of the knower to the
        thing known is necessary. Therefore, although there is the least
        possible likeness between a creature and God in regard to agreement in
        nature, there is, on the other hand, the greatest possible likeness
        between them inasmuch as the divine essence most clearly represents the
        creature. Consequently, the divine intellect knows a thing most
        perfectly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The statement that God beholds nothing outside Himself should be
        taken as referring to that <i>in which</i> God beholds, not to that
        which He beholds; for that in which He beholds all things is Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Although a line loses none of its quantity if an actual point is
        taken from it, if we take from a line its essential property of
        terminating in a point, the very substance of the line perishes. The
        same principle is also true of God; for, while nothing will be detracted
        from God if a creature of His is supposed as not existing, His
        perfection will be destroyed if His power of producing a creature is
        taken from Him. For He knows things, not only inasmuch as they actually
        exist, but also inasmuch as they are within His power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Although knowledge has only being for its object, it is not
        necessary that what is known should be a real being at the time in which
        it is known; for, just as we know things that are distant in place, we
        also know things distant in time, as is evident from our knowledge of
        things past. Hence, it is not inconsistent to affirm a knowledge of God
        that is about things that are not eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. The word <i>perfection,</i> if taken strictly, cannot be used of
        God, for nothing is perfected unless it is made.
        <i>Perfection,</i> however, is used more negatively of God than
        positively. Hence, He is said to be perfect because nothing at all is
        lacking to Him, not because there is something in Him which was in
        potency to perfection and is perfected by something else which is its
        act. Consequently, there is no passive potency in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. What is understood or sensed moves the sense or intellect only if
        the sense knowledge or intellectual knowledge is received from things.
        Divine cognition is not of this kind; hence, the argument does not
        follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. According to the Philosopher, the delight of the intellect arises
        from its agreeable operation. Hence, he says: “God delights in one
        simple operation.” Therefore, the object of the intellect is the cause
        of intellectual delight in so far as it is the cause of an intellectual
        operation; and it is this in so far as it produces its likeness in the
        intellect, so that by it the activity of the intellect may be informed.
        Hence, it is clear that the thing which is understood causes delight in
        the intellect only when the intellect’s knowledge is received from
        things. This is not true of the divine intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. The term to <i>be,</i> taken simply and absolutely, is understood
        only of the divine existence. This is also true of the good; and for
        this reason it is said in Luke (18:19): “None is good but God alone.”
        Hence, the more closely a creature approaches God, the more it possesses
        of the act of existence; the further it is from Him, the more it
        possesses of non-existence. But, since a creature approaches God only in
        so far as it participates in a finite act of existence, yet its distance
        from God is always infinite, it is said to have more non-existence than
        existence. However, since the act of existing which it has is from God,
        it is known by God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        17. In line with the preceding answer, a visible creature possesses
        truth only in so far as it approaches the first truth. As Avicenna says,
        it possesses falsity in so far as it falls short of it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        18. A thing is compared to God in two ways: first, according to a common
        measurement, and then a creature, when compared with God, is found to be
        almost nothing at all; second, according to its dependence upon God,
        from whom it receives its act of existing. In this latter way, it is
        compared with God only with respect to its act of existing, and in this
        way, also, it cad be known by God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        19. That axiom is to be understood as applying only to our intellect,
        which receives its knowledge from things. For a thing is led by gradual
        steps from its own material conditions to the immateriality of the
        intellect through the mediation of the immateriality of sense.
        Consequently, whatever is in our intellect must have previously been in
        the senses. This, however, does not take place in the divine intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        20. It is true, as Avicenna says, that a natural agent is a cause only
        of becoming. This is evident from the fact that, when such a cause
        ceases to exist, a thing does not cease to be, but merely ceases to
        become. But since the divine agent imparts the act of existence to
        things, He is the cause of their existence, although He does not enter
        into their constitution. Yet He has a certain resemblance to the
        essential principles which enter into the constitution of a thing, and
        for this reason He knows not only the becoming of a thing, but also its
        act of existing and its essential principles.

        It seems that He does not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As Boethius says, the object of cognition is “universal as long as it
        is understood, singular as long as it is sensed.”’ Now, since there is
        no sensitive knowledge in God, but only intellectual knowledge, God has
        only universal knowledge of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. If God knows creatures, He knows them either by many or by one
        species. If He knows them by many, His knowledge as it is in the knower
        will be multiplied, because that by which one knows is in the knower. If
        He knows creatures by one species, and it is impossible to have proper
        and distinct knowledge of many things by means of one species, it would
        seem that God does not have proper knowledge of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. God is the cause of things in so far as He imparts the act of
        existing to them—just as fire is the cause of warm things from the fact
        that it pours heat into them. Now, if fire could know itself, by knowing
        its own heat, it would know other things only in so far as they are
        warm. Consequently, by knowing His own essence, God knows other things
        only inasmuch as they are beings. That, however, is not proper knowledge
        of things, but a most universal knowledge of things. Therefore, God does
        not have proper knowledge of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Proper knowledge of a thing can be had only through a species which
        comprises nothing more or nothing less than is in the thing itself. For,
        just as the color green would be imperfectly known by means of a species
        that fell short of it,—for example, the species of black—so also would
        green be imperfectly known by a species that went beyond it—for example,
        the species of white. For in white, the nature of color is found to
        exist most perfectly; therefore, whiteness, as is said in the
        <i>Metaphysics,</i> is the measure of all colors. Now, in the measure in
        which God surpasses a creature, in that measure the creature falls short
        of God. Therefore, since the divine essence can in no way be known
        properly and completely by means of a creature, neither can a creature
        be known properly by means of the divine essence. God, however, knows
        creatures only through His essence. Therefore, He does not have proper
        knowledge of them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Any medium that causes proper knowledge of a thing can be used as the
        middle term of a demonstration whose conclusion will be that thing. The
        divine essence, however, does not stand in such a relation to a
        creature; otherwise, creatures would exist whenever the divine essence
        existed. Consequently, by knowing creatures through His essence, God
        does not have proper knowledge of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. If God knows a creature, He knows it either in its own nature or in
        an idea. If He knows it in its own nature, then the proper nature of a
        creature is the means by which God knows a creature. But the medium of
        knowing is a perfection of the knower; hence, the-nature of a creature
        would be a perfection of the divine intellect. This, of course, is
        absurd. On the other hand, if God knows a creature in an idea, since the
        idea is more removed from a thing than are the essentials or accidentals
        of the thing, God’s knowledge of a thing will be less than that
        knowledge which is had through its essentials or accidentals. But all
        proper knowledge of a thing is had through its essential constituents or
        accidents, because, as is said in <i>The Soul</i>: “Even accidents
        contribute in a great part to our knowledge of what a things.
        Consequently, God does not have proper knowledge of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Proper knowledge of any particular thing cannot be had through a
        universal medium. For example, we cannot have proper knowledge of man by
        means of “animal.” But the divine essence is the most universal medium
        possible, since it is the universal medium for knowing all things.
        Therefore, God cannot have proper knowledge of creatures by means of His
        essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The type of knowledge is determined by its medium of knowing.
        Therefore, proper knowledge can be had only through a proper medium. The
        divine essence, however, cannot be the proper medium of knowing a
        particular creature, because, if it were proper to that one, it would
        not be the medium of knowing anything else; for what belongs to this
        creature and to that is common to both and not proper to either.
        Therefore, God does not have proper knowledge of creatures by knowing
        through His own essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Dionysius says that God knows “material things immaterially and many
        things as united,” or, in other words, distinct things indistinctly.
        Now, since this is the kind of knowledge by which God knows things, He
        has merely indistinct knowledge of things, and therefore He does not
        properly know this or that.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. No one can distinguish between things if he does not have proper
        knowledge of them. But God has that kind of knowledge of creatures which
        distinguishes between them; for He knows that this creature is not that
        creature. Otherwise, He could not give each creature according to its
        own capacity or reward each person according to his merits by passing a
        just judgment upon men’s actions. Therefore, God has proper knowledge of
        things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Nothing imperfect should be attributed to God. But that kind of
        knowledge by which something is known in merely a general way and not in
        particular is imperfect knowledge, for it lacks something. Therefore,
        divine knowledge of things is not merely general but also particular.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. God, who is most happy, would be most stupid if it were true that He
        does not know what we know about things. The Philosopher regards such a
        position as inconsistent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From the fact that God ordains a thing to its end one can prove that God
        has proper knowledge of things; for a thing can be ordained to its
        proper end only through knowledge of its proper nature, according to
        which it has a determinate relation to that end. How this is possible we
        must consider as follows.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        By knowing a cause, we know the effect only inasmuch as the effect
        follows from the cause. Therefore, if there is some universal cause
        whose action is not determined to any effect except through the
        intermediate action of some particular cause, from the knowledge of such
        a common cause we will not have proper knowledge of the effect but
        merely a general knowledge of it. For example, the action of the sun is
        determined to the production of this plant through the intermediate
        action of a germinating force which is either in the ground or in the
        seed. Consequently, if the sun could know itself, it would not have a
        proper knowledge of this plant but only a general knowledge, unless it
        also knew the proper causes of the plant. Therefore, in order to have
        proper and perfect knowledge of any effect, the knower must have
        assembled in himself complete knowledge of the proper and common causes.
        This is also what the Philosopher says: “We are said to know a thing
        when we know its first causes and its first principles down to its
        elements,” that is, down to its proximate causes, as the Commentator
        explains.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, we say that something is known to God inasmuch as He is its cause
        through His essence. In this way a thing is in Him and can be known by
        Him. Therefore, since He is the cause of all proper and common causes,
        through His essence He knows all proper and common causes; for there is
        in a thing, determining its common nature, nothing of which God is not
        the cause. Consequently, the reason for His knowledge of the common
        nature of things is the very same as the reason for His knowledge of the
        proper nature and proper causes of each individual thing. Dionysius
        gives the same explanation when he writes: “If according to one cause
        God gives being to all existing things, then He knows all things
        according to that same cause”“—and further on: “For the cause of all,
        knowing itself, would be idle somewhere if it did not know those things
        that are from it and whose cause it is.” <i>Idle</i> here means to fall
        short of causing something that is found in a thing; and it would follow
        that God would be idle in this sense were He ignorant of any of the
        realities that exist in a thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus, it is clear from what has been said that all the examples induced
        to show that God knows all things in Himself are faulty—like that of the
        point, which, if it could know itself, would (according to the example)
        know lines, and that of light, which, by knowing itself, would know
        colors. For not everything in a line can be reduced to a point as to its
        cause, nor can everything in color be reduced to light. Consequently, if
        a point knew itself, it would know the line only in a general way; and
        light would know color similarly. This is not the case with divine
        knowledge, as is clear from what has been said in the preceding article.

        1. That statement of Boethius should be understood as referring to our
        intellect, not to the divine intellect, which can know singulars, as
        will be explained later.” However, even though our intellect does not
        know singulars, it has proper knowledge of things by knowing them
        according to their distinctive specific characters. Consequently, even
        if the divine intellect did not know singulars, it could nevertheless
        have proper knowledge of things.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. God knows all things by one principle, for that principle has the
        intelligible character of many. This principle is His essence, which is
        the likeness of all things; and since His essence is the proper
        intelligible character of each and every thing, He has proper knowledge
        of all things. How one thing can be both the proper and the common
        intelligible character of many things may be explained as follows.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The divine essence is the intelligible character of a thing inasmuch as
        that thing imitates the divine essence. No created thing, however, fully
        imitates the divine essence. For, if so, there would be only one such
        imitation, and the divine essence considered in that way would be the
        proper intelligible character of only one being, just as there is only
        one image of the Father which perfectly imitates Him, and that is the
        Son. However, since a created thing imperfectly imitates the divine
        essence, it happens that different things imitate it in different ways;
        yet every one of them has been produced according to a likeness of the
        divine essence. Thus, whatever is proper to each finds in the divine
        essence that which it imitates. In this respect, the divine essence is
        the likeness of a thing, even in regard to what is proper to it.
        Similarly, it is the proper intelligible character of that thing, and,
        for the same reason, the proper character of another thing, and also of
        all other things. Therefore, it is the common character of all things in
        so far as it is the one thing which all things imitate; but it is the
        proper character of this or that thing inasmuch as things imitate it in
        different ways. In this way the divine essence causes proper knowledge
        of each and every thing, for it is the proper intelligible character of
        all.

        3. Fire is not the cause of warm things with respect to everything found
        in them, as is the case with the divine essence, as we have pointed
        out.* Hence, there is no parallel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Whiteness surpasses green with respect to one of the two things that
        belong to the nature of color, namely, light, which is, as it were, the
        formal element in the composition of color. In this respect, whiteness
        is the measure of all colors. But there is something else in colors
        which is, as it were, their material element, namely, the determination
        of the transparent medium. In this respect, whiteness is not the measure
        of colors; and thus it is clear that everything contained in the other
        colors does not exist in the species of whiteness. Consequently, proper
        knowledge of any of the other colors cannot be had through the species
        of whiteness. This is not the case with the divine essence. Moreover, in
        the divine essence, other things exist as in their cause; but other
        colors do not exist in whiteness as in their cause. Hence, there is no
        parallel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Demonstration is a type of argumentation accomplished by a discursive
        process of the intellect. The divine intellect, which is not discursive,
        does not know its effects through its essence as if by demonstration,
        even though it has more certain knowledge of things by means of its
        essence than one who demonstrates has by means of his demonstration.
        Besides, if anyone could comprehend God’s essence, through it he would
        know the nature of each individual thing with greater certainty than a
        conclusion is known by means of demonstration. Nevertheless, it does not
        follow from the fact that God’s essence is eternal that His effects are
        eternal; for His effects are not in His essence in such a way that they
        should always exist in themselves but merely that they should exist at
        <i>some time,</i> whenever the divine wisdom has determined.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. God knows things in their proper nature if that restriction refers to
        His knowledge from the point of view of the thing known. However, if we
        are speaking of His knowledge on the part of the knower, then God knows
        things in an idea, that is, through an idea which is the likeness of all
        things existing in reality, both accidental and essential, although the
        idea itself is neither an accident nor the-essence of the thing. In the
        same manner, our intellectual likeness of a thing is neither essential
        nor accidental to the thing itself, but it nevertheless is a likeness of
        the thing’s essence or accident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The divine essence is a universal medium as though it were a
        universal cause. The relation of a universal cause to the production of
        knowledge is quite different from that of a universal form. For in a
        universal form the effect is, as it were, in material potency, somewhat
        as differences are in a genus after the analogy of forms in matter, as
        Porphyry says. However, effects are in a cause in an active potency,
        just as a house exists in the mind of the architect in active potency.
        Now, since everything is known in so far as it is in act, and not in so
        far as it is in potency, the fact that the differences specifying a
        genus are in it potentially does not suffice for proper knowledge of a
        species through the generic form. But since what is proper to a thing
        exists in some active cause, it is sufficient to know that thing through
        that cause. Consequently, a house is not known by means of its wood and
        stones as it is known by means of the form of it which is in the
        architect. Since the proper conditions of each and every thing, are in
        God as in its active cause, even though His essence is a universal
        medium, it can give proper knowledge of all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The divine essence is both a common and a proper medium, but not in
        the same respect, as has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. When it is said that “God knows distinct things indistinctly,” the
        statement is true if <i>indistinctly</i> qualifies the knowing from the
        point of view of the knower; for with one cognition God knows all
        things. This is how Dionysius understands the statement. On the other
        hand, if it qualifies the knowing in regard to what is known, the
        statement is false; for God knows the distinction of one thing from
        another, and also that by which one thing is distinguished from another.
        Therefore, He has proper knowledge of each and every thing.

        It seems that He does not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Our intellect does not know singulars because it is separated from
        matter. But the divine intellect is much more separated from matter than
        ours. Hence, it does not know singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It was noted, however, that our intellect does not know singulars,
        not only because it is separated from matter, but also because it
        abstracts its knowledge from things.—On the contrary, our intellect
        cannot receive anything from things without the mediation of sense or
        imagination. Consequently, sense and imagination receive from singular
        things before our intellect does, yet singulars are known through sense
        and imagination. Hence, the fact that the intellect receives from things
        is no reason why it should not know singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. It was said, however, that from things the intellect receives a form
        that is entirely purified; but this is not the case with sense and
        imagination.—On the contrary, it is not by reason of the purifying of
        the form considered as a starting point that our intellect does not know
        singulars. Indeed, from this point of view the intellect ought to know
        singulars all the more, for the assimilative character of intellection
        comes from the fact that it has received something from reality. It
        remains, therefore, that what prevents knowledge of singulars is the
        purifying of the form considered as an end-result, which is the purity
        that the form has in the intellect. Now, that purity of the form is had
        only because of the freedom of the intellect from matter; and that is
        the only reason why our intellect does not know singulars, namely, be
        cause it is separated from matter. Thus, our point that God does not
        know singulars is proved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. If God knows some singulars, He should know all; for the argument for
        one is the same as the argument for all. But He does not know all
        singulars. Therefore, He knows none. The proof of the minor premise is
        as follows: “Many things,” as Augustine says, meaning despicable things,
        “it is better not to know than to know.”’ But many singulars are
        worthless. Since everything which is better should always be attributed
        to God, it seems that He does not know all singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. All knowledge takes place through an assimilation of the knower with
        what is known. But there is no assimilation between singulars and God,
        for singulars are changeable and material, and have many other qualities
        of this sort, whose complete contraries are in God. Therefore, God does
        not know singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Whatever God knows, He knows perfectly. But perfect knowledge is not
        had of a thing unless it is known in the same way as it exists. Now,
        since God does not know a singular in the same way as it exists, for a
        singular is material, and God knows immaterially, it seems that God
        cannot know the singular perfectly, and consequently does not know it at
        all.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. But it was said that while perfect knowledge demands that the knower
        know the thing just as it is, this refers only to what is known, not to
        the operation of the knower.—On the contrary, knowledge arises from the
        application of the thing known to the knower. Therefore, the mode of
        what is known and the mode of the knower should be the same. Thus, the
        distinction given seems to be invalid.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. According to the Philosopher, if one wishes to find something, he
        must previously have some knowledge of it. What he has through some
        common form is not sufficient, unless that form is contracted by
        something. For example, one could not well look for a slave he has lost
        unless he had previously had some knowledge of the slave, otherwise he
        would not recognize him even when he found him; nor would it be enough
        to know that the slave was a man, because this would not mark him off
        from others. He must, instead, have some knowledge particularized by the
        points that are proper to the slave. Consequently, if God is to know any
        singular, the common form by which He knows, His essence, must be
        contracted by something. But since there is nothing in Him by which it
        can be contracted, it seems that He does not know singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. It was said, however, that that species through which God knows is
        common in such a way that it nevertheless is proper to each and every
        thing.—On the contrary, <i>proper</i> and common are opposed to each
        other. Therefore, it is impossible that the same reality be both a
        proper and a common form.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The operation of sight is not determined to any one colored thing
        because of light, which is the medium of sight; it is determined rather
        by the object, the colored thing itself. But in God’s knowledge, His
        essence is the medium by which He knows things; for His essence is, as
        it were, a medium of knowledge, and, as Dionysius says, like a light by
        which all things are known. Consequently, His knowledge is in no way
        determined to any singular; thus, He does not know singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Since knowledge is a quality, it is a form whose variations change
        the subject. But knowledge is changed as its objects are changed; for
        example, if I know that you are sitting, I lose that knowledge when you
        get up. Hence, the knower is changed when what he knows changes. But God
        cannot be changed in any way whatsoever. Therefore, He cannot know
        singulars, which are subject to change.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. No one can know a singular unless he knows that by which a singular
        is constituted. But that which makes a singular to be such is matter.
        God, however, does not know matter. Hence, He does not know singulars.
        The proof of the minor is as follows: There are, as Boethius and the
        Commentator say, certain things which are difficult for us to know
        because of a defect in us—for example, the very things which are most
        knowable in themselves, immaterial substances. On the other hand, there
        are other things which are not known because of some defect in them—for
        example, those that have very little existence, such as motion, time,
        vacuums, and the like. Now, first matter has a very limited act of
        existence. Hence, God does not know matter since it is of itself
        unknowable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. But it was said that although matter cannot be known by our
        intellect, it can be known by the divine intellect.—On the contrary, our
        intellect knows a thing by means of a likeness received from the thing,
        but the divine intellect knows it by means of a likeness that is the
        cause of the thing. Now, a greater conformity is needed between a thing
        and a likeness which causes that thing than is needed between [that
        thing and] some other likeness. Therefore, since the deficiency of
        matter is the reason why our intellects cannot get a likeness sufficient
        for the knowledge of matter, much more will it be the reason why the
        divine intellect cannot get a likeness sufficient for the knowledge of
        matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. According to Algazel, God knows Himself because the three things
        required for knowledge are found in Him: an intelligent substance
        separated from matter, an intelligible thing separated from matter, and
        the union of both. From this it follows that nothing is known unless it
        is separated from matter. Now, a singular as such cannot be separated
        from matter. Hence, it cannot be understood.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. Knowledge is an intermediary between the knower and the object; and
        the more knowledge moves away from the knower, the more imperfect it is.
        Now, whenever knowledge is directed to something outside the knower, it
        rushes out, as it were, to something external. But, since divine
        knowledge is most perfect, it does not seem that it should be about
        singulars, which are outside of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. The act of knowledge essentially depends upon the knowing power, but
        just as essentially upon the thing known. But it is out of place to say
        that an act of divine knowledge, which is God’s essence, essentially
        depends on something outside of itself. Hence, it is inadmissible to say
        that He knows singulars, which are outside of Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        17. Whatever is known is known according to the manner in which it is in
        the knower, as Boethius says. But things exist in God immaterially and,
        hence, without the concretion of matter and material conditions.
        Therefore, He does not know those things which depend upon matter, such
        as singulars.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. We read in the first Epistle to the Corinthians (13:12): “But then I
        shall know even as I am known.” Now, the Apostle who was speaking was a
        singular. Therefore, singulars are known by God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        21. As is clear from what was said earlier,” things are known by God in
        so far as He is their cause. But since He is the cause of singulars, He
        must know them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. It is impossible to know the nature of an instrument without knowing
        the purpose for which the instrument is ordained. Now, senses are
        certain powers ordained as instruments to knowledge of singular things.
        If God did not know singulars, He would also be ignorant of the nature
        of the senses, and, as a consequence, of the nature of the human
        intellect, whose object is the forms in the imagination. This, however,
        is absurd.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. God’s wisdom is equal to His power. Therefore, whatever falls under
        His power falls under His knowledge. Now, His power extends itself to
        the production of singulars. Consequently, His knowledge extends itself
        to a knowledge of the same.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. As was said above, God’s knowledge of things is proper and distinct.
        But this could not be true if He did not know the factors which
        distinguish one thing from another. He knows, therefore, the singular
        conditions of each and every thing, by which one thing is distinguished
        from another; consequently, He knows singulars in their singularity.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There have been many errors in connection with this problem. Some, as
        the Commentator mentions, have simply denied that God knows singulars,
        except, perhaps, in general. These persons wish to confine the nature of
        the divine intellect within the limits of our own. But this error can be
        destroyed by the reasoning used by the Philosopher against Empedocles;
        for if—as would follow from what Empedocles had said—God were ignorant
        of that which others knew, God would be most stupid, although He Himself
        is most happy and, for this reason, most wise. The same thing would be
        true if it were asserted that God did not know the singulars which all
        of us know.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, others, such as Avicenna and his followers, have said that
        God knows every singular, but universally, as it were, in knowing all
        the universal causes from which a singular is produced. An astronomer,
        for example, knowing all the motions of the heavens and the distances
        between the celestial bodies, would know every eclipse that will occur
        even for the next hundred years, yet he would not know any one eclipse
        as a distinct singular so as to have evidential knowledge that it
        actually exists or not—which a country bumpkin has when he sees an
        eclipse. It is in this manner, they say, that God knows singulars: He
        does not, as it were, see them in their singular nature but through
        knowledge of universal causes. But neither can this opinion stand; for
        from universal causes there follow only universal forms, unless
        something intervenes through which these forms are individuated. But
        from a number of universal forms gathered together—no matter how great
        this number may be—no singular can be constituted, because the
        collection of these forms can still be understood to be in many.
        Therefore, if one were to know an eclipse by means of universal causes
        in the manner described above, he would know, not a singular, but only a
        universal. For a universal cause has as proportionate to it a universal
        effect, and a particular cause, a particular effect. Hence, there would
        still remain the inadmissible consequence mentioned earlier, that God
        should be ignorant of singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, we must simply admit that God knows all singulars, not only
        in their universal causes, but also each in its proper and singular
        nature. As proof of this, note that the divine knowledge which God has
        of things can be compared to the knowledge of an artist, since He is the
        cause of all things as art is the cause of all works of art. Now, an
        artist knows a product of his art by means of the form which he has in
        himself and upon which he models his product. However, he produces his
        work only with respect to its form—nature has prepared the matter for
        the works of art. Accordingly, by means of his art, an artist knows his
        works only under the aspect of the form. Now, every form is of itself
        universal; and, consequently, by means of his art, a builder knows,
        indeed, house in general, but not this house or that house, unless he
        acquires other knowledge of it through his senses. But if the artistic
        form produced matter as it produces form, then by its means the artist
        would know his work both under the aspect of its form and under that of
        its matter. Consequently, since matter is the principle of
        individuation, he would know it not only in its universal nature but
        also inasmuch as it is a definite singular. Therefore, since divine art
        produces not only the form but also the matter, it contains not only the
        likeness of form but also that of matter. Consequently, God knows things
        in regard to both their matter and their form; and, therefore, He knows
        not only universals but also singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But a difficulty still remains. Since everything that is in something is
        in it according to the manner of that in which it is, and thus the
        likeness of a thing can be in God only immaterially, how is it that our
        intellect, because it receives the forms of things in an immaterial way,
        does not know singulars, yet God knows them?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The reason for this will be clear if we consider the difference between
        the relation to the thing had by its likeness in our intellect and that
        had by its likeness in the divine intellect. For the likeness in our
        intellect is received from a thing in so far as the thing acts upon our
        intellect by previously acting upon our senses. Now, matter, because of
        the feebleness of its existence (for it is being only potentially),
        cannot be a principle of action; hence, a thing which acts upon our soul
        acts only through its form; consequently, the likeness of a thing which
        is impressed upon our sense and purified by several stages until it
        reaches the intellect is a likeness only of the form.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On the other hand, the likeness of things in the divine intellect is one
        which causes things; for, whether a thing has a vigorous or a feeble
        share in the act of being, it has this from God alone; and because each
        thing participates in an act of existence given by God, the likeness of
        each is found in Him. Consequently, the immaterial likeness in God is a
        likeness, not only of the form, but also of the matter. Now, in order
        that a thing be known, its likeness must be in the knower, though it
        need not be in him in the same manner as it is in reality. Hence, our
        intellect does not know singulars, because the knowledge of these
        depends upon matter, and the likeness of matter is not in our intellect.
        It is not because a likeness of the singular is in our intellect in an
        immaterial way. The divine intellect, however, can know singulars, since
        it possesses a likeness of matter, although in an immaterial way.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Besides being separated from matter, our intellect receives its
        knowledge from things. Consequently, because it does not receive forms
        materially and, because matter can have no likeness, our intellect does
        not know singulars. The case is otherwise with the divine intellect, as
        has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Sense and imagination are powers attached to bodily organs.
        Conscquently, likenesses of things are received in them in a material
        manner, that is, with material conditions, although without matter. For
        this reason, they know singulars. The case is otherwise with the
        intellect. Hence, the argument does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Because of the terminus of the purifying process, it happens that the
        form is received immaterially; but this alone does not explain why the
        singular is not known. It is rather because of the very beginning of
        this process that the likeness of matter is not received into the
        intellect, but only that of the form. Hence, the argument does not
        follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. All knowledge, taken in itself, belongs to the class of good things;
        but it may happen accidentally that the knowledge of certain despicable
        things is bad, either because it is the occasion of some base action
        (and for this reason certain knowledge is forbidden) or because some
        individual might be kept from better things because of certain
        knowledge; consequently, what is good in itself may harm certain people.
        This, however, cannot happen to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. For knowledge a likeness of conformity in nature is not required, but
        only a representative likeness. For example, we are reminded of a
        certain man merely by a golden statue of him. This argument, however,
        proceeds on the assumption that knowledge requires a likeness consisting
        in conformity in nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The perfection of knowledge consists in knowing the thing to be as it
        is, not in having the same mode of existence as the thing known in the
        knower—as we have said repeatedly above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. That application of the known to the knower, which causes knowledge,
        should not be understood by way of identity but rather by way of
        representation. Therefore, it is not necessary that the mode of the
        knower and of what is known be the same.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. That argument would hold if the likeness by which God knows were
        common in such a way that it could not be proper to each individual
        thing. That the contrary is true we have shown earlier.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. The same thing in the same aspect cannot be both common and proper.
        But how the divine essence, through which God knows all things, is a
        common likeness of all, yet a proper likeness of each, has been
        explained above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. There are two mediums for physical sight. First, there is the medium
        <i>under which</i> it knows. This is light, which does not determine
        sight to any particular object. Second, there is the medium
        <i>by which</i> it knows, namely, the likeness of the thing known. By
        this medium, sight is determined to a special object. In divine
        knowledge, however, the divine essence takes the place of both. Hence,
        it can cause proper knowledge of individual things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Divine knowledge is in no way changed by a change in the objects of
        its knowledge. Our knowledge varies when the objects change because it
        knows with separate conceptions things present, past, and future.
        Consequently, when Socrates is not sitting, the cognition had of him
        when he was sitting becomes false. God, however, sees things as present,
        past, or future in a single intuition. Therefore, no matter how a thing
        may change, the truth in His intellect remains the same.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Those things which possess a defective act of existence fall short
        of knowability for our intellect for the very reason that they fall
        short, of the ability to act. But this does not affect the divine
        intellect, which, as we have said, does not receive its knowledge from
        things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. In the divine intellect, which is the cause of matter, there can
        exist a likeness of matter which, as it were, leaves its impression
        upon, the matter. In our intellect, however, a likeness cannot exist
        that is capable of making us know matter. This is clear from what has
        been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. Although a singular as such cannot be separated from matter, it can
        be known by means of a likeness separated from matter, namely, the
        likeness of matter itself. Consequently, even if it be separated from
        matter physically, it is not separated from matter representatively.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. An act of divine knowledge is not something other than God’s
        essence, for in God intellect and intellectual operation are one and the
        same, because His action is His essence. His knowledge, therefore,
        cannot be said to pass outside of Him simply because He knows something
        other than Himself. Moreover, no action of a cognitive power can be said
        to pass outside in the way in which acts of physical powers do, which go
        from the agent into the patient. For knowledge does not mean something
        flowing from the knower to a thing known, as happens in physical
        actions. It means, rather, the existence of the thing known in the
        knower.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. An act of divine knowledge has no dependence upon the thing known;
        for the relation implied in divine knowledge does not involve dependence
        of the knowledge upon the things known, but, rather, the dependence of
        the thing known upon the knowledge. The opposite is true of us, for the
        relation implied by the word <i>knowledge</i> when used of us is one
        that indicates a dependence of our knowledge upon its object. Moreover,
        the relation of an act of knowledge to its object is not the same as its
        relation to the power of knowing; for it is supported in its act of
        existence by the knowing power, not by its object, because the act is in
        the power but not in the object.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        17. A thing is known because it is represented in the knower, not
        because it exists in him; for the likeness existing in a knowing power
        is a principle by which a thing is known, not under the aspect of the
        act of being it has in the knowing power, but under the aspect of the
        relation it has to the thing known. Consequently, a thing is not known
        according to the mode of existence which the likeness of the thing has
        in the knower, but rather according to the manner in which the likeness
        existing in the intellect represents the thing. Therefore, although the
        likeness in the divine intellect has an immaterial act of existence,
        nevertheless, since it is a likeness of matter, it is also a principle
        of knowing material things and, therefore, singulars.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The human intellect knows by abstracting the form from matter. Now,
        the abstraction of a form from matter does not destroy its
        particularity, for mathematics, which abstracts from matter, considers
        particular lines. Consequently, the fact that our intellect is
        immaterial does not prevent it from knowing singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Singulars are not distinct according to their participation in a
        common nature, for the fact that many men participate in the species of
        man makes them one man. Therefore, if our intellect knows only
        universals, it does not know one singular as distinct from another.
        Consequently, our intellect would not direct us to those objects of
        operations in regard to which we are guided by choice; for choice
        presupposes the distinction of one thing from another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. But it was said that our intellect knows singulars inasmuch as it
        applies the universal form to some particulars.—On the contrary, our
        intellect cannot apply one thing to another unless it already knows
        each. Consequently, knowledge of the singular precedes the application
        of the universal to the singular. Therefore, the above-mentioned
        application cannot be the reason why our intellect knows the singular.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. According to Boethius, whatever a lower power can do a higher power
        can do. Now, as he says in the same place, the intellect is superior to
        imagination and the imagination is superior to sense. Therefore, since
        sense knows the singular, our intellect should also know it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Boethius says: “What is sensed is singular, what is understood is
        universal.”

        All action is determined by the condition of the form of the agent, the
        principle of action, just as the process of heating is measured by the
        amount of heat. Now, the likeness of the thing known, by which the
        knowing power is informed, is the principle of actual knowledge, just as
        heat is of heating. Hence, all cognition is necessarily determined by
        the limitations of the form in the knower. Consequently, since the
        likeness of a thing existing in our intellect is received as separated
        from matter and all the conditions of matter, which are the principles
        of individuation, it follows that our intellect, of itself, does not
        know singulars but only universals. For every form as such is universal,
        unless it happens to be a subsistent form, which, from the very fact of
        its being subsistent, is incommunicable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It happens, however, that our intellect knows the singular indirectly.
        For, as the Philosopher says, phantasms are related to our intellect as
        sensible objects are related to sense and as colors outside the soul are
        related to sight. Therefore, just as the species in the sense is
        abstracted from things themselves and by its means the cognition of the
        sense is extended to the sensible things themselves, so also our
        intellect abstracts the species from the phantasms, and, by means of
        this species, its cognition is extended, in a certain sense, to the
        phantasms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There is, however, this difference: The likeness in sense is abstracted
        from the thing as from an object of knowledge, and, consequently, the
        thing itself is directly known by means of this likeness. The likeness
        in the intellect, however, is not abstracted from the phantasm as from
        an object of knowledge but as from a medium of knowledge after the
        manner in which our sense receives the likeness of a thing which is in a
        mirror; it is directed to it not as to a thing but rather as to a
        likeness of a thing. Consequently, from the species which it receives,
        our intellect is not applied directly to knowing the phantasm but rather
        the thing whose phantasm is presented. Nevertheless, by a certain
        reflection our intellect also returns to a knowledge of the phantasm
        itself when it considers the nature of its act, the nature of the
        species by which it knows, and, finally, the nature of that from which
        it has abstracted the species, namely, the phantasm. It is like the case
        of sight, which is brought through a likeness received from a mirror
        directly to a knowledge of the thing reflected, but by a sort of
        reflection to the image itself in the mirror. Therefore, inasmuch as our
        intellect, through the likeness which it receives from the phantasm,
        turns back upon the phantasm from which it abstracts the species, the
        phantasm being a particular likeness, our intellect gets some kind of
        knowledge of the singular because of its dynamic union with the
        imagination.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. There are two kinds of matter from which abstraction is made:
        intelligible matter and sensible matter—as is clear from the
        <i>Meta</i> physics. I call that matter <i>intelligible</i> which is
        considered in the nature of a continuum, and <i>sensible,</i> that which
        is physical matter. Each, however, can be taken in two ways: as
        designated and as not designated. I call matter <i>designated</i> if it
        is considered together with the determination of its dimensions, that
        is, with these or those dimensions. I call it
        <i>not designated,</i> however, if it is considered without the
        determination of its dimensions. In this connection, it must be noted
        that designated matter is the principle of individuation, from which
        every intellect abstracts inasmuch as it is said to abstract from the
        here and now. The intellect of the natural Philosopher, however, does
        not abstract from non-designated sensible matter; for it considers man,
        flesh, and bone, in whose definitions non-designated sensible matter is
        included. The intellect of the mathematician, however, abstracts
        entirely from sensible matter, though not from non-designated
        intelligible matter. Hence, it is clear that abstraction, which is
        common to all intellects, makes a form universal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. According to the Philosopher, in us the intellect is not the only
        motive principle. The imagination is also such, and, by its means, the
        universal knowledge of the intellect is applied to some particular thing
        to be done. For this reason, the intellect is, as it were, a remote
        mover, but particular reason and the imagination are proximate movers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Man has prior knowledge of singulars through imagination and sense.
        Consequently, he can apply his universal intellectual knowledge to a
        particular; for, properly speaking, it is neither the intellect nor the
        sense that knows, but man that knows through both—as is clear from
        <i>The Soul</i>.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. What a lower power can do a higher power can do; not in the same, but
        in a more noble, way. Consequently, the intellect knows the same thing
        that sense knows, but in a more noble, because a more immaterial, way.
        Hence, it does not follow that the intellect knows the singular if the
        senses know it.

        1. The divine intellect always remains in the same state; but a
        singular, inasmuch as now it exists and now it does not exist, has
        different states. Consequently, the divine intellect does not know
        whether or not a singular now exists.

        2. Those powers of the soul which are indifferent to a thing’s presence
        or absence—as, for example, the imagination—do not know whether or not a
        thing exists; this is known only by those powers, such as sense, which
        do not know absent things as though they were present. Now, the divine
        intellect is disposed in the same way to things present or absent.
        Consequently, it does not know whether things exist now or not; it knows
        merely their natures.

        3. According to the Philosopher, the composition signified when a thing
        is said to be or not to be is not in things but only in the intellect.
        Now, there can be no composition in the divine intellect. Therefore, God
        does not know whether or not a thing exists.

        4. In the Gospel according to St. John (1:3-4) we read: “What was made,
        in Him was life. Now, in his explanation of this passage, Augustine says
        that created things are in God in the way in which a trunk is in the
        mind of the one who makes it. By means of the mental likeness of the
        trunk, however, a carpenter does not know whether the trunk exists or
        not. Consequently, neither does God know whether or not a singular now
        exists.

        5. The more noble knowledge is, the more it resembles God’s knowledge.
        But the knowledge of an intellect comprehending the definitions of
        things is more noble than sense knowledge; for, when the intellect
        defines, it penetrates to the interior of a thing, but sense deals with
        externals. When the intellect defines, however, it does not know whether
        a thing exists or not, but simply the nature of the thing. Sense,
        however, does have such knowledge. It seems, therefore, that that type
        of knowledge by which only the nature of a thing is known, but not
        whether a thing exists or not, should be attributed to God.

        6. God knows each and every thing by means of the idea He has of it.
        Now, that idea is indifferent to the existence or the non—existence of
        the thing. Otherwise, God could not know the future by means of it. God,
        therefore, does not know whether or not a thing exists.

        1. The more perfect knowledge is, the more conditions it grasps in its
        object. Now, divine knowledge is most perfect; consequently, it knows a

        He knows if a thing does or does not exist.

        The relation of the universal essence of any species to the essential
        properties of that species is the same as that of a singular essence to
        all the proper accidents of that singular, that is, all the accidents
        found in the singular; for, in so far as they are individuated by the
        singular, they are made proper to it. Now, by knowing the essence of a
        species, the intellect comprehends all the essential properties of that
        species; for, as the Philosopher says, the definition is the principle
        of any demonstration that concludes to the proper accidents of a subject
        Therefore, once the proper essence of any singular were known, all the
        accidents of that singular would also be known. Our intellect, however,
        cannot know the essence of a singular, because it abstracts from
        designated matter, which pertains to the essence of a singular and would
        be placed in its definition if the singular had one. The divine
        intellect, however, can comprehend not only the universal essence of a
        species, but, since it can apprehend matter, it can also comprehend the
        singular essence of each and every thing. Therefore, it knows all
        accidents, those common to the entire species or genus, as well as those
        proper to each individual. Among these latter is time, in which every
        concrete reality is found and according to which a thing is said to
        exist now or not. Consequently, God knows whether or not each and every
        thing exists; and He knows all other propositions that can be formed
        about universals or individuals.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In this respect, however, the divine intellect differs from ours. In
        order to know a subject and an accident and to know different accidents,
        our intellect forms separate concepts, and, consequently, passes from
        knowledie of a substance to knowledge of one of its accident. Again,— in
        order to know the inherence of one of its accidents, it joins one
        species with the other, and, in a certain manner, unites them. In this
        way, the intellect forms propositions in itself. But by one reality,
        namely, its own essence, the divine intellect knows all substances and
        all accidents. Consequently, it neither passes from substance to
        accident nor joins one with the other; but instead of the joining of
        species which takes place in our intellect, there is, in the divine
        intellect, complete unity; because of this, God, without complexity,
        knows what is complex, just as He knows many things simply and with
        unity, and material things immaterially.

        1. By means of one and the same reality, the divine intellect knows all
        the conditions in a thing that are subject to change; so, while
        remaining in one and the same state, it knows all the states of things,
        no matter how they change.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The likeness in the imagination is a likeness merely of the thing; it
        is not a likeness by which one can know the time in which a thing
        exists. This limitation is not found in the divine intellect, so the
        cases are not parallel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In place of the composition found in our intellect, there is,
        instead, a unity in the divine intellect. This composition, however, is
        a kind of imitation of unity, and for this reason it is said to be a
        union. Thus, it is clear that God knows enunciable truths by not
        composing more truly than an intellect that does compose and divide.

        5. He who knows a definition knows potentially the truths demonstrable
        by the definition. But in the divine intellect,
        <i>actually to be</i> does not differ from
        <i>to be able to be.</i> Consequently, from the fact that it knows the
        essences of things, it immediately comprehends all the accidents that
        follow upon them.

        6. That idea in the divine mind is related to a thing in the same way,
        no matter what its condition is, for it is a likeness of the thing
        according to all its states. Consequently, through it the divine mind
        knows that thing in any condition whatever.

        God’s knowledge of created things may be compared to that which an
        artist has of his artistic products and which is their cause. Hence, the
        relation of God’s knowledge to things known is the opposite of the
        relation of our knowledge to them. Our knowledge is received from
        things, and, by its nature, comes after them. But the Creator’s
        knowledge of creatures, and the artist’s of his products, by its very
        nature, precedes the things known. Now, when what is antecedent is
        removed, what is subsequent is likewise removed; but the opposite is not
        true. Hence, our knowledge of natural things cannot be had unless these
        things previously exist; but the actual existence or non-existence of a
        thing is a matter of indifference to the intellect of God or that of an
        artist.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We must remark, however, that an artist has two kinds of knowledge about
        something that can be made: speculative and practical. He has
        speculative or theoretical knowledge when he knows the intimate nature
        of a work but does not have the intention of applying the principles to
        the production of the work. His knowledge is practical, properly
        speaking, when by his intention he ordains the principles of the work to
        operation as an end. In this way, as Avicenna says, medicine is divided
        into theoretical and practical.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is clear that the practical knowledge of an artist follows his
        speculative knowledge, since it is made practical by applying the
        speculative to a work. But when the practical is absent, the speculative
        remains. Evidently, then, an artist can have knowledge of some work
        which he sometimes sets about making and sometimes does not, as when he
        thinks up the form of some piece of handicraft which he does not intend
        to make. Moreover, the artist does not always regard this work which he
        does not take steps to make as something within his power; for sometimes
        he visualizes a type of device entirely beyond his power of making. He
        regards it rather in the light of his own purposes, that is, he sees
        that he could attain such and such an end by means of such and such a
        device. For, as the Philosopher says, in the order of things to be done,
        ends are as principles are in the order of things to be studied; hence,
        as conclusions are known in their principles, products of art are known
        in the light of their purposes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is clear, therefore, that God can know some non-beings. Of some He
        has, as it were, practical knowledge-that is, of those which are, have
        been, or will be; and these come forth from His knowledge as He decides.
        Of those which neither have been, are, nor will be-which He has decreed
        never to make-He has a kind of speculative knowledge. And although one
        can say that He sees these things as within His power, since there is
        nothing He cannot do, it is more appropriate to say that He sees them in
        His goodness, the end of all that is made by Him; for He sees that there
        are many other ways of communicating His goodness, besides those He has
        already communicated to existing things, having existence, past,
        present, or future, because all created things cannot equal His
        goodness, no matter how much they seem to participate in it.

        1. Things which neither have been, are, nor will be, exist in some way

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Knowledge received from things known consists in a passive
        assimilation by which the knower is assimilated to objects of knowledge
        previously existing. But knowledge which is the cause of things known
        consists in an active assimilation by which the knower assimilates the
        thing known to himself. Since God can assimilate to Himself that which
        has not yet been assimilated to Him, He can also have knowledge of
        non-being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. If, according to common usage, <i>idea</i> is taken as meaning the
        form of practical knowledge, then there is an idea only of those things
        which have been, are, or will be. If it be taken as also meaning the
        form of speculative knowledge, then there can also be an idea of other
        things-those things which neither are, have been, nor will be.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The Word designates the operative power of the Father by which all
        His operations take place. Hence, the Word is extended only to those
        things to which the divine operation is extended. Consequently, we read
        in the Psalms (32:9): “He spoke and they were made.” For, although the
        Word knows other beings, it is not the word of other beings.

        far as they possess existence, namely, in so far as they are in their
        active principle or final cause. As such, they are also known by God.

        Therefore, whatever God knows, in some sense He pass through. But an
        infinite cannot in any way be passed through either by a finite or by an
        infinite being. Therefore, God does not know infinites in any way
        whatsoever.

        6. Whoever sees something limits that thing by the very fact that he can
        see it. But whatever God knows He sees. Therefore, what is infinite
        cannot be known by Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. If God knows infinite things, then His knowledge is infinite. But
        this cannot be, for whatever is infinite is imperfect, as is proved in
        the <i>Physics</i>. Consequently, God does not know infinite things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Whatever is repugnant to the definition of an infinite can by no
        means be attributed to an infinite. But to be known is repugnant to the
        definition of an infinite; for “it is characteristic of an infinite,” as
        is said in the <i>Physics</i>, “that whatever quantity one takes from
        it, there always remains more to be taken.” However, that which is known
        must be taken or received by the knower; and a thing is not known fully
        if something of it remains beyond the knower. Consequently, it is
        clearly repugnant to the definition of an infinite that it be fully
        known by someone. Therefore, since whatever God knows He knows fully, He
        does not know infinite things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. God’s knowledge is the measure of the thing He knows. But there
        cannot be any measure for an infinite. Hence, an infinite does not come
        within His knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Measuring is simply ascertaining the quantity of what is measured.
        Therefore, if God knew an infinite, and thus knew its quantity, He would
        measure it. But this is impossible, because an infinite, by its very
        nature, is immeasurable. Hence, God does not know an infinite.

        3. In order to understand something, immateriality is required in the
        one who understands, in the thing understood, and in the conjunction of
        the two. But, since the divine intellect is infinitely more immaterial
        than any created intellect, it is infinitely more capable of
        understanding. Now, a created intellect can know what is potentially
        infinite. Therefore, the divine intellect can know what is actually
        infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. God knows whatever is, will be, or has been. But, if the duration
        world were infinite, then generation would never end, and there would be
        an infinite number of singular things. This, moreover, would be possible
        for God. Therefore, it is not impossible for Him to know infinites.

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. As the Commentator says, “All proportions and forms which are
        potentially in first matter exist actually in the first mover.”
        Augustine agrees when he says that there are seminal principles of
        things in first matter, but that the causal principles are in God. Now,
        in first matter there are, potentially, an infinite number of forms,
        because its passive potency is infinite. Therefore, in God, the first
        mover, there are actual infinites. But God knows whatever is in Him
        actually. Hence, God knows infinites.

        6. In arguing against the Academics, who denied that anything was true,
        Augustine shows that there is not merely a multitude of true things but
        even an infinite multitude of them, resulting from a kind intellectual
        reduplication or from the reduplication of a sentence. For example, if I
        tell the truth, it is true that I tell the truth, and it is true that I
        say that I tell the truth, and so on to infinity. But God knows all true
        things. Hence, He knows infinites.

        7. Whatever is in God is God. Therefore, God’s knowledge is God Himself.

        knowledge is infinite, and He has knowledge of infinites.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As Augustine says, some, wishing to conceive of the divine intellect in
        terms of our own intellects, have said that God cannot know infinites,
        just as we cannot know them; and since they asserted both that God knows
        singulars and that the world is eternal, it followed that there would be
        a cycle of numerically the same things in different ages—an opinion
        which is utterly absurd.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It must accordingly be said that God knows infinites, as can be shown
        from the reasons given above. For, since He knows not only things which
        have been, are, or will be, but also all those which could participate
        in His goodness—and the number of these is infinite since His goodness
        is infinite—it follows that He knows infinites. How this takes place
        must now be considered.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Note, therefore, that cognition extends itself to many or to few things
        according to the force of the means of knowing. For example, a likeness
        received in the sense of sight has the same determinations as the
        particular conditions of the thing. Hence, it leads us to the knowledge
        of only one thing. But a likeness received in the intellect is freed
        from particular conditions; and since it is more elevated, it leads us
        to the knowledge of a number of things. Indeed, because one universal
        form, by its very nature, is such that it can be participated in by an
        infinite number of singulars, the intellect can in some way be said to
        know infinites. However, since that intellectual likeness does not lead
        to knowledge of a singular according to its distinctive features but
        only under the aspect of a common nature, our intellect, through the
        species which it has within it, knows infinites only potentially. But
        the medium by which God knows, namely, His own essence, is a likeness of
        the infinites capable of imitating that essence. It is a likeness not
        only of that which is common to them, but also of those features by
        which they are distinguished from one another, as is clear from what was
        said earlier. Hence, the divine cognition has the power to know
        infinites.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The manner in which God knows actual infinites must now be considered.
        There is no reason why something cannot be infinite in one respect and
        finite in another. For example, a body can be infinite in length but
        finite in width. The same can be true of forms. For example, let us
        suppose some infinite body that is white. The extensive quantity of the
        whiteness (in so far as whiteness can be said to have quantity
        accidentally) will be infinite; but its intensive or essential quantity
        will nevertheless be finite. The same is true of any other form of an
        infinite body; for every form received in matter is limited according to
        the nature of the recipient and so does not have infinite intensity. It
        is possible neither to know nor to traverse an infinite. Both are
        repugnant to the idea of infinite. Nevertheless, if something were to be
        moved across an infinite, not in the direction of its infinity, it could
        be traversed. For example, what is infinite in length but finite in
        width could be traversed across its width but not along its length.
        Similarly, if an infinite were known in the respect in which it is
        infinite, it could by no means be known perfectly; but, if it were known
        in a respect which is not that of the infinite, it could be perfectly
        known. For, since “the character of infinity fits quantity,” as the
        Philosopher says, and quantity of its very nature has an order of parts,
        an infinite would be known by way of its infinity if it were known part
        by part.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If our intellect had to know a white body in this manner, it would never
        be able to know either it or its whiteness perfectly. If, however, it
        knew the nature of whiteness or of corporeity which is found in an
        infinite body, then it would know the infinite perfectly with respect to
        all its parts— not, however, according to its infinity. Thus it is
        possible for our intellect in some manner to know an infinite continuum
        perfectly; but it cannot know an infinite number of things taken one by
        one, since it cannot know many things by means of one species. Hence, if
        our intellect has to consider a number of things, it has to know them
        one after another. Consequently, it knows discontinuous quantity only
        through continuous quantity. Therefore, if it were to know a multitude
        that is actually infinite, our intellect would be knowing an infinite
        according to its infinity, but that is impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The divine intellect, however, knows all things through one species,
        Hence, simultaneously and with one intuition, God has knowledge of all
        things. Consequently, He does not know a multitude according to the
        order of its parts, and He can know an infinite multitude, but not
        according to its infinity; for, if He were to know it according to its
        infinity so that He would be grasping part after part of the multitude,
        He would never come to its end and never know it perfectly. I simply
        concede, therefore, that God actually knows infinites absolutely. These
        infinites, however, are not equal to His intellect in the way in which
        He Himself as known equals His intellect; for the essences of created
        infinites are, as it were, intensively finite as whiteness is in an
        infinite body. God’s essence, however, is infinite in all respects; and
        because of this all infinites are finite to Him and can be comprehended
        by Him.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. A thing is said to be made finite by a knower in the sense that it is
        known to such an extent that it does not exceed the intellect of the
        knower; in other words, some part of it does not remain outside the
        knower’s intellect. In this way, the thing known stands as something
        finite to the intellect. There is no reason why this cannot happen to an
        infinite which is known in a way other than according to its infinity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Knowledge of simple intelligence and that of vision imply no
        difference on the part of the knower but only on the part of the things
        known. Knowledge of vision is said to be in God because of its
        resemblance to bodily sight which looks upon things outside of itself.
        Hence, God is said to know by His knowledge of vision only those things
        that are outside of Him, whether they are present, past, or future. But,
        as was proved above, God knows by His knowledge of simple intelligence
        things that neither are, will be, nor ever have been. There is no other
        way by which God knows these and those things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, the fact that God does not see infinites is not due to His
        knowledge of vision but rather to the non-existence of the things that
        would be the objects of His knowledge of vision. For if it were held
        that these were infinite, either actually or successively, no doubt God
        would know them by His knowledge of vision.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Properly speaking, sight is a bodily sense. Hence, if the word
        <i>vision</i> is transferred to immaterial cognition, its use will be
        merely metaphorical. In metaphors, however, there is a different basis
        of truth according to the different points of likeness found in things.
        Hence, nothing prevents our sometimes calling all divine knowledge
        vision and at other times reserving the name to that which is about
        things present, past, and future.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. By His essence God Himself is a likeness of all things and a proper
        likeness of each one of them. Hence, there cannot be said to be many
        intelligible characters of things in God except in regard to His various
        relations to various creatures. These relations, however, are merely
        rational relations. Moreover, as Avicenna says, there is no reason why
        rational relations cannot be multiplied to infinity.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <i>5. Passing through</i> implies a motion from one thing to another.
        Since God knows all the parts of an infinite, continuous or
        discontinuous, not by a progression of His thought, but in one simple
        intuition, He therefore knows an infinite perfectly. He does not,
        however, pass through an infinite in understanding it.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. This argument is based on what is infinite in a privative sense-a
        type of infinity peculiar to quantity. Whatever is spoken of privatively
        is imperfect. The argument does not touch what is infinite in the
        negative sense in which God is said to be infinite. It is more perfect
        for a thing not to be limited at all.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The argument proves that an infinite cannot be known according to its
        infinity; for whatever part of its infinity you take, no matter how big
        it is, something further will always remain to be taken. God, however,
        does not know an infinite by passing from part to part.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. That which is infinite in quantity has a finite act of existence, as
        has been said. Accordingly, God’s knowledge can be the m6asure of an
        infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The nature of measuring consists in this, that from it certainty
        results about the determinate quantity of a thing. God, however, does
        not know an infinite in such a way that He knows its determinate
        quantity, for an infinite does not have determinate quantity. Hence, it
        is not repugnant to the nature of an infinite that God should know it.

        divine power to carry them into execution.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Seneca’s opinion is to the contrary: “An idea is an exemplar off
        things coming into being naturally.” But, since there cannot be infinite
        things naturally, it would seem that they cannot come to be; for what
        cannot be cannot come to be. Therefore, there will be no idea of
        infinites in God. But God cannot make anything except through an idea.
        Therefore, He cannot make infinites.

        2. When God is said to create a thing, nothing new on the part of the
        Creator is affirmed but only on the part of the creature. Hence, it
        seems the same to say that God creates things as to say that things come
        forth into being from God. For the same reason, therefore, to say that
        God can create things is to say that things are able to come forth from
        God into being. But infinite things cannot come to be, for no creature
        has the capacity for infinite act. Hence, even God cannot make actual
        infinites.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The infinite can be distinguished in two ways. In one way, it is
        distinguished by means of potency and act. A potential infinite is that
        which consists in an endless succession. For example, we find potential
        infinity in generation, in time, and in the division of a continuum;
        for, when one member is given, another always follows. An example of an
        actual infinite, however, would be a line which we would assume to have
        no termini.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the second way, an essential infinite is distinguished from an
        accidental infinite. This distinction is explained as follows: “The
        character of the infinite,” as mentioned above, “belongs to quantity.”
        Now, quantity is predicated first of all of discrete quantity rather
        than of continuous quantity. Hence, in order to see what is infinite
        essentially and what is infinite accidentally, we must consider that a
        multitude is sometimes required essentially and sometimes merely
        accidentally. Essentially a multitude is required in ordered causes and
        effects where one has an essential dependence upon another. For example,
        the soul sets in motion the natural heat by which nerves and muscles are
        moved, which, in turn, move the hands, which move a stick by which a
        stone is moved. In this series, each of the later members essentially
        depends upon every one that precedes. But an accidental multitude is
        found when all the members of the multitude are posited, as it were, in
        place of one; and their mutual relation is such that it is a matter of
        indifference whether they be one or many, or more or fewer. For example,
        if a builder makes a house in whose construction he wears out many saws
        successively, a multitude of saws is required for the erection of the
        house only accidentally, that is, because one saw cannot last forever.
        It does not matter to the house how many saws are used; hence, one saw
        does not have that dependence upon another which we find when a
        multitude is required essentially.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There are many different opinions about the infinite. Some ancient
        philosophers posited actual infinites, both essential and accidental,
        thinking that an infinite would necessarily be a result of what they
        posited as a beginning. For this reason, they also posited an infinite
        process of causes. The Philosopher refutes this position, however.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Others, following Aristotle, conceded that an essential infinite cannot
        be found either in act or in potency, because it is impossible for a
        thing to depend essentially upon an infinite number of things; for, if
        this were true, then its own act of existence would never be formally
        constituted. But they posited an accidental infinite, both in potency
        and in act. Algazel holds: “There are an infinite number of human souls
        separated from bodies”—something which he thought followed from his view
        that the world is eternal. He saw no difficulty since they have no
        mutual dependence, and so in their multiplicity they constituted merely
        an accidental infinity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Others asserted that there cannot be an actual infinite, either
        essential or accidental. They admitted a potential infinite, which, as
        is taught in the <i>Physics,”</i> consists in succession; and this is
        the position of the Commentator. But for either of two reasons it can
        happen that an actual infinite cannot exist: either because to be in act
        is contradictory to the infinite by the very fact that it is infinite;
        or because of some extrinsic reason—as being lifted up is repugnant to a
        lead triangle, not because it is a triangle, but because it is lead.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But if an actual infinite is not contradictory to the infinite as such
        and can exist, as I hold, or if it cannot exist merely because of some
        impediment extrinsic to the notion of an infinite, then I say that God
        can make an actual infinite. If, however, actual existence is repugnafit
        to the very notion of an infinite, then God cannot make one, just as,
        for example, He cannot make a man be an irrational animal. This would
        mean that two contradictories would coincide in one act of existence.
        However, whether or not it is intrinsically repugnant for an actual
        infinite to exist must be discussed elsewhere, since this question arose
        only incidentally. Answers, however, must be given to the difficulties
        on both sides.

        1. Natures in the divine mind are not reproduced in a creature the way
        in which they are in God, but in the way which the nature of a creature
        allows. Hence, although they themselves are immaterial, from them are
        brought forth things with a material act of existence. If, therefore, as
        the Philosopher says, it is of the essence of an infinite to exist, not
        actually and simultaneously, but merely successively, then the infinite
        natures in the divine mind cannot all be produced in creatures
        simultaneously but only successively. So, it does not follow that there
        are actual infinites.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The power of a creature is said to be wanting in two ways. First, it
        can be wanting because of a lack of strength. In this respect, it is
        correct to argue that what a creature cannot do God can do. Second, it
        can be wanting because that which is said to be impossible for a
        creature to do contains in itself some intrinsic repugnance. In this
        respect, it is possible neither for a creature nor for God-as, for
        instance, that contradictories should exist simultaneously, and that an
        <i>infinite actually exist</i> falls into this class, if to exist
        actually is repugnant to the nature of an infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. As is said in the <i>Physics,</i> a being is useless if it does not
        attain the end for which it exists. Hence, a power is not said to be had
        in vain simply because it is not put into act, but only because its
        effect or the very act, being distinct from the power itself, is the end
        for which the power exists. However, no effect of the divine power is
        its end, nor is its act distinct from it. Hence, the argument does not
        follow.

        1. Although the members of infinites may not naturally be able to exist
        simultaneously, they may, however, come into being. For the essence of
        an infinite does not consist in simultaneous existence; but it is like
        things which are in a state of becoming, such as a day or a contest, as
        is said in the <i>Physics</i>. Nor does it follow that God is able to
        make only things which come into being naturally. It is true that
        according to the meaning given previously an idea was taken as applying
        to practical knowledge, which is an idea for this reason that it is
        determined by the divine will to an act. However, by His will God is
        able to make many things other than those which He has determined to
        exist now, in the past, or in the future.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Although in creation there is nothing new except in reference to the
        creature, the word <i>creation</i> implies not only this newness but
        also something on the part of God; for it signifies a divine action,
        which is His essence, and connotes an effect in a creature, which is the
        reception of being from God. So, it does not follow that it is the same
        to say that God can create something as to say that something can be
        created by Him. Otherwise, before there was a creature, nothing could be
        created unless the potency of a creature first existed. This would be
        positing eternal matter. Therefore, although the potency of a creature
        does not extend to the existence of actual infinites, this does not
        exclude ability on the part of God to make actual infinites.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Wherever there exists a common ground for univocal or analogical
        statement, there exists a certain likeness. But there can be no likeness
        between a creature and God. Therefore, there cannot be anything common
        to both either univocally or analogically. Consequently,’if knowledge is
        predicated of God and of us, it will be merely an equivocal predication.
        Proof of the minor: In Isaiah (40:18) we read: “To whom then have you
        likened God? “—as if to say: “He can resemble no one.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Wherever a likeness exists, some comparison is possible. But no
        comparison between God and creature is possible, since a creature is
        finite and God is infinite. Therefore, no likeness can exist between
        them, and the original difficulty stands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Whenever a comparison is possible, there must be some form possessed
        to a gre;tter and a lesser degree or equally by several things. But this
        cannot be said of God and a creature, for then something would be-more
        simple than God. Therefore, no comparison between God and a creature is
        possible, nor is any likeness or community possible apart from that of
        equivocation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. There is a greater distance between things which bear no resemblance
        than between those which do resemble each other. But there is an
        infinite distance between God and a creature; indeed, no greater
        distance is possible. Therefore, there is no likeness between them;
        thus, the original difficulty returns.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. A greater distance lies between a creature and God than lies between
        a created being and non-being; for a created being surpasses non-being
        only by reason of the amount of its entity, which is not infinite. But,
        as is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i>: “There is nothing common to being
        and non-being except by equivocation, which happens, for example, when
        that which we call man is called non-man by others.” Hence, there cannot
        be anything common to God and a creature except by a pure equivocation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. All analogates are such that either one is placed in the definition
        of another—as substance is placed in the definition of accident, and
        act, in the definition of potency—or the same thing is placed in the
        definition of both—as the health of an animal is placed in the
        definition of healthy, which is predicated of urine and food since one
        is the sign of this health and the other conserves it. But God and
        creatures are not related in this manner: one is not placed in the
        definition of the other, nor is something identical placed in the
        definition of each, even on the supposition that God could be defined.
        Therefore, it seems that nothing can be predicated analogously of God
        and creatures. As a consequence, any term predicated of both of them is
        used only equivocally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Substance and accident differ more than do two species of substances.
        But when the same word is used to signify two species of substances
        according to formal character proper to each, the predication is merely
        equivocal. This happens, for example, when the word <i>dog</i> is
        applied to the dog-star, a barking dog, and the dog-fish. It would be a
        far more equivocal predication if one word were applied to a substance
        and an accident. Now, our knowledge is an accident and that of Gdd, a
        substance. Therefore, the word <i>knowledge</i> is predicated
        equivocally of God’s and of ours.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Our knowledge is merely an image of the divine knowledge. But the
        name of a thing cannot be applied to its image except by equivocation.
        Hence, <i>animal,</i> according to the Philosopher, is predicated
        equivocally of a real animal and of one in a picture. Therefore, the
        word <i>knowledge</i> is likewise predicated only equivocally of God’s
        knowledge and ours.

        1. The Philosopher says that that is perfect, absolutely speaking, in
        which the perfections of all genera are found. As the Commentator
        remarks on this passage, such a being is God. But the perfections of
        other genera could not be said to be found in Him unless there were some
        resemblance between His perfection and the perfections of other genera.
        Hence, a creature resembles God in some way. Knowledge, therefore, and
        whatever else is predicated of God and creatures is not a pure
        equivocation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Genesis (1:2 6) says: “Let us make man to our image and likencss.”
        Therefore, some likeness exists between God and creature. We conclude as
        before.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is impossible to say that something is predicated univocally of a
        creature and God because in all univocal predication the nature
        signified by the name is common to those of whom the univocal
        predication is made. Hence, from the point of view of the nature
        signified by the predicate, the subjects of the univocal. predication
        are equal, even though from the point of view of its real existence one
        may take precedence over another. For example, all numbers are equal
        from the point of view of the nature of number, even though, by the
        nature of things, one number is naturally prior to another. No matter
        how much a creature imitates God, however, a point cannot be reached
        where something would belong to it for the same reason it belongs to
        God. For things which have the same formal characters but are in
        separate subjects are common to the same subjects in regard to substance
        or quiddity but distinct in regard to the act of being. But whatever is
        in God is His own act of being; and just as His essence is the same as
        His act of being, so is His knowledge the same as His act of being a
        knower. Hence, since the act of existence proper to one thing cannot be
        communicated to another, it is impossible that a creature ever attain to
        the possession of something in the same manner in which God has it, just
        as it is impossible for it to attain the same act of being as that which
        God has. The same is true of us. If <i>man</i> and
        <i>to exist as man</i> did not differ in Socrates, man could not be
        predicated univocally of him and Plato, whose acts of existing are
        distinct.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Nevertheless, it cannot be said that whatever is predicated of God and
        creatures is an equivocal predication; for, unless there were at least
        some real agreement between creatures and God, His essence would not be
        the likeness of creatures, and so He could not know them by knowing His
        essence. Similarly, we would not be able to attain any knowledge of God
        from creatures, nor from among the names devised for creatures could we
        apply one to Him more than another; for in equivocal predication it
        makes no difference what name is used, since the word does not signify
        any real agreement.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consequently, it must be said that knowledge is predicated neither
        entirely univocally nor yet purely equivocally of God’s knowledge and
        ours. Instead, it is predicated analogously, or, in other words,
        according to a proportion. Since an agreement according to proportion
        can happen in two ways, two kinds of community can be noted in analogy.
        There is a certain agreement between things having a proportion to each
        other from the fact that they have a determinate distance between each
        other or some other relation to each other, like the proportion which
        the number two has to unity in as far as it is the double of unity.
        Again, the agreement is occasionally noted not between two things which
        have a proportion between them, but rather between two related
        proportions—for example, six has something in common with four because
        six is two times three, just as four is two times two. The first type of
        agreement is one of proportion; the second, of proportionality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We find something predicated analogously of two realities according to
        the first type of agreement when one of them has a relation to the
        other, as when being is predicated of substance and accident because of
        the relation which accident has to substance, or as when healthy is
        predicated of urine and animal because urine has some relation to the
        health of an animal. Sometimes, however, a thing is predicated
        analogously according to the second type of agreement, as when sight is
        predicated of bodily sight and of the intellect because understanding is
        in the mind as sight is in the eye.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In those terms predicated according to the first type of analogy, there
        must be some definite relation between the things having something in
        common analogously. Consequently, nothing can be predicated analogously
        of God and creature according to this type of analogy; for no creature
        has such a relation to God that it could determine the divine
        perfection. But in the other type of analogy, no definite relation is
        involved between the things which have something in common analogously,
        so there is no reason why some name cannot be predicated analogously of
        God and creature in this manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But this can happen in two ways. Sometimes the name implies something
        belonging to the thing primarily designated which cannot be common to
        God and creature even in the manner described above. This would be true,
        for example, of anything predicated of God metaphorically, as when God
        is called lion, sun, and the like, because their definition includes
        matter which cannot be attributed to God. At other times, however, a
        term predicated of God and creature implies nothing in its principal
        meaning which would prevent our finding between a creature and God an
        agreement of the type described above. To this kind belong all
        attributes which include no defect nor depend on matter for their act of
        existence, for example, being, the good, and similar things.

        1. As Dionysius says,” God can in no way be said to be similar to
        creatures, but creatures can be said to be similar to Him in some sense.
        For what is made in imitation of something, if it imitates it perfectly,
        can be said to be like it absolutely. The opposite, however, is not
        true; for a man is not said to be similar to his image but vice versa.
        However, if the imitation is imperfect, then it is said to be both like
        and unlike that which it imitates: like, in so far as it resembles it;
        unlike, in so far as it falls short of a perfect representation. It is
        for this reason that Holy Scripture denies that creatures are similar to
        God in every respect. It does, however, sometimes grant that creatures
        are similar to God, and sometimes deny this. It grants the similarity
        when it says that man is made in the likeness of God, but denies it when
        it says: “O God, who is like to thee?” (Psalms 70:19).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The Philosopher” distinguishes two kinds of likenesses. One is found
        between things in different genera, and is taken according to proportion
        or proportionality; that is, one thing is related to another as a third
        thing is related to a fourth, as Aristotle himself says in the same
        place. The second kind of likeness is found existing between things in
        the same genus, as when the same thing is found in distinct subjects.
        Now, likeness of the first kind does not demand a comparison based on a
        definite relationship as does that of the second kind. Consequently, the
        possibility of the first type of likeness existing between God and
        creature should not be excluded.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That difficulty arises from the second type of likeness; and we grant
        that this type does not exist between creature and God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. A likeness that is found because two things share something in common
        or because one has such a determinate relation to the other that from
        one the other can be grasped by the intellect—such a likeness diminishes
        distance. A likeness according to an agreement of proportion does not;
        for such a likeness is also found between things far or little distant.
        Indeed, there is no greater likeness of proportionality between two to
        one and six to three than there is between two to one and one hundred to
        fifty. Consequently, the infinite distance between a creature and God
        does not take away the likeness mentioned above.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. There is some agreement between being and non-being according to
        analogy, for non-being itself is called being analogously, as is made
        clear in the <i>Metaphysics.</i> Consequently, the distance lying
        between a creature and God cannot prevent a common ground for analogical
        statement.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. That argument is valid in regard to community of analogy taken
        according to a definite relation of one thing to another. In that case,
        one thing must be put in the definition of the other as substance is put
        in the definition of accident or as one thing is put into the definition
        of two other things because both are predicated with reference to it, as
        substance is put into the definition of quantity and quality.

        7. Although two species of substance have more in common than accident
        and substance have, it is possible that the same word is not applied to
        the two different species by reason of any consideration of something
        common between them. In that case, the word will be merely equivocal.
        But it is possible for a word common to substance and accident to be
        used because of a consideration of what they have in common. In such a
        case the word will not be equivocal but analogous.

        8. The word <i>animal</i> is used not to signify the external form which
        a picture imitates when it depicts a real animal, but to signify its
        internal nature, in which it is not imitated. Hence, <i>animal</i> is
        used equivocally of the real animal and of the one painted. But the word
        <i>knowledge</i> is suitable to both creature and Creator in the respect
        in which the creature imitates the Creator. Consequently, knowledge is
        not predicated of the two altogether equivocally.

        1. Nothing but the true can be known, as is said in the
        <i>Posterior Analytics.</i> But, as said in <i>Interpretation</i>, there
        is no definite truth in singular future contingents. Hence, God does not
        have knowledge of individual and contingent futures.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. That from which the impossible would follow is impossible. But if God
        knew a singular future contingent, the impossible would follow, namely,
        that God’s knowledge would be wrong. Hence, it is impossible for Him to
        know a singular future contingent. Proof of the minor follows. Let us
        suppose that God knows some singular future contingent event, such as
        that Socrates is sitting. Now, either it is possible that Socrates is
        not sitting or it is not possible. If it is not possible, then it is
        impossible for Socrates not to sit. Hence, for Socrates to sit is
        necessary, although what was granted was contingent. On the other hand,
        if it be possible not to sit, and granted he does not, nothing
        inconsistent follows from this. It would follow, however, that the
        knowledge of God is erroneous, and hence it would not be impossible for
        His knowledge to be false.

        3. It was said, however, that the contingent, as it is in God, is
        necessary.—On the contrary, what is in itself contingent is not
        necessary with respect to God, except in the way in which it is in God.
        But inasmuch as it is in Him, it is not distinct from Him. If,
        therefore, it is known by God only as necessary, He will not know it in
        the way it exists distinct from Himself.

        4. According to the Philosopher, when the major of a syllogism expresses
        necessity and the minor expresses inherence, a conchision expressing
        necessity follows. But the following is true: Whatever is known by God
        must necessarily be. For, if what God knew as existing did not exist,
        His knowledge would be false. Therefore, if something is known by God to
        exist, it necessarily exists. But no contingent must necessarily be.
        Therefore, no contingent is known by God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. It was said, however, that when it is said that whatever is known by
        God must necessarily be, the necessity implied is not with reference to
        the creature but to God alone.—On the contrary, when it is said that
        whatever is known by God must necessarily be, the necessity is
        attributed to the thing for which the subject of the statement stands.
        Now, the subject of the statement is that which is known by God, not God
        Himself as knowing. Therefore, the necessity implied in this statement
        refers only to the thing known.

        6. The more certain our knowledge is, the less it has to do with
        contingents; for science is only about necessary truths, since it is
        more certain than opinion, which may be about contingent things. Now,
        God’s knowledge is most certain; hence, it can be about necessary
        matters only.

        7. If the antecedent of any true conditional proposition is absolutely
        necessary, the consequent will be absolutely necessary. But the
        following conditional is true. If something is known by God, it will
        exist. Since this antecedent, “This is known by God,” is absolutely
        necessary, the consequent will be absolutely necessary. Hence, whatever
        is known by God must necessarily exist. That this, namely, “This is
        known by God,” is absolutely necessary was proved as follows. This is
        something said about the past. But whatever is said about the past, if
        true, is necessary; for, since it has been, it cannot not have been.
        Therefore, it is absolutely necessary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Whatever is eternal is necessary. Now, all that God has known He has
        known from eternity. Therefore, that He has known is absolutely
        necessary.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Everything is related to the true as it is related to the act of ex,
        istence. But future contingents do not have any act of existence;
        therefore, neither do they have truth. Hence, there can be no certain
        knowledge of them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. According to the Philosopher, whoever does not understand one
        determined thing understands nothing. But if a future contingent is open
        to its being or not being, it is by no means determined either in itself
        or in its cause. Therefore, there can, by no means, be any knowledge of
        it at all.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Hugh of St. Victor says: “God, who has all things in Himself, knows
        nothing outside Himself.” Now, whatever is contingent is outside of Him,
        for in Him there is no potentiality. Hence, He does not know future
        contingents at all.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Something contingent cannot be known through a medium that is
        necessary; for, if the medium is necessary, the conclusion will be
        necessary. Now, God knows all things through a medium, His own essence.
        Hence, since this medium is necessary, it seems that He cannot know
        anything contingent.

        1. The Psalms (32:15) speak as follows: “He who hath made the hearts of
        every one of them; who understandeth all their works.” But the works of
        men are contingent since they depend on free choice. Therefore, God
        knows future contingents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Whatever is necessary is known by God. Now, every contingent is
        necessary inasmuch as it is related to divine cognition, as Boethius
        says.— Therefore, every contingent is known by God.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        31. Augustine says: “God knows changeable things in an unchangeable
        manner. But if a thing is contingent, it is changeable; for a contingent
        is said to be that which can either be or not be. Hence, God knows
        contingents in an unchangeable manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. God knows things in so far as He is their cause. But God is the cause
        not only of necessary but also of contingent things. Therefore, He knows
        both necessary and contingent things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. God knows all things to the extent that the model of all things is in
        Him. But the divine model for the contingent and the necessary can be
        immutable, just as it is an immaterial model for the material and a
        simple model for the composite. Hence, it seems that just as God knows
        what is composite and material, although He Himself is immaterial and
        simple, so also He can know contingents, although contingency has no
        place in Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. To know is to understand the cause of a thing. Now, God knows the
        causes of all contingents; for He knows Himself, the cause of all
        things. Hence, He knows contingents.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On this question there have been several erroneous opinions. Some,
        wishing to pronounce upon divine knowledge from the viewpoint of our own
        way of knowing, have said that God does not know future contingents.
        This opinion cannot stand, for it would eliminate providence over human
        affairs, which are contingent. Consequently, others have said that God
        has knowledge of all futures, but that all take place necessarily,
        otherwise His knowledge of them would be subject to error. But neither
        can this opinion stand, for it would destroy free choice and there would
        be no need to ask advice. Moreover, it would be unjust to punish or to
        give rewards in proportion to merit when everything takes place
        necessarily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, it must be said that God knows all futures; nevertheless, this
        does not prevent things from taking place contingently. As evidence of
        this, it should be noted that we have certain powers and cognitive
        habits in which there can never be falsity; for example, sense, science,
        and the understanding of principles. On the other hand, we have others
        in which there can be falsity; for example, imagination, opinion, and
        judgment. Now, falsity occurs in a cognitive act because something is
        not in reality as it is apprehended. Hence, if there is any knowing
        power such that there is never any falsity in it, then the thing to be
        known by it never falls short of what the knower apprehends about it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, what is necessary cannot be prevented from happening even before it
        happens, in view of the fact that its causes are unchangeably ordained
        to its production. Hence, by means of habits that are always true, what
        is necessary can be known even when it will happen in the future, just
        as we know a coming eclipse or the rising of the sun by means of true
        science. But a contingent can be impeded before it is brought into
        being; for at that stage it exists only in its causes, which may be
        prevented from producing their effect. After a contingent has been
        brought into existence, however, it can no longer be prevented. Hence,
        such a power or habit can make about a present contingent a judgment in
        which falsity is never found, as sense does when it judges that Socrates
        is sitting when he sits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From this it is clear that a contingent can be known as future by no
        cognition that excludes all falsity and the possibility of falsity; and
        since there is no falsity or possibility of falsity in the divine
        knowledge, it would be impossible for God to have knowledge of future
        contingents if He knew them as future. Now, something is known as future
        when an order of past and future stands between the event and the
        knowledge. This order, however, cannot be found between the divine
        knowledge and any contingent thing whatsoever; but the relation of the
        divine knowledge to anything whatsoever is like that of present to
        present. This may be understood by the following example.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If someone were to see many people walking successively down a road
        during a given period of time, in each part of that time he would see as
        present some of those who walk past, so that in the whole period of his
        watching he would see as present all of those who walked past him. Yet
        he would not simultaneously see them all as present, because the time of
        his seeing is not completely simultaneous. However, if all his seeing
        could exist at once, he would simultaneously see all the passers-by as
        present, even though they themselves would not all pass as
        simultaneously present. Therefore, since the vision of divine knowledge
        is measured by eternity, which is all simultaneous and yet includes the
        whole of time without being absent from any part of it, it follows that
        God sees whatever happens in time, not as future, but as present. For
        what is seen by God is, indeed, future to some other thing which it
        follows in time; to the divine vision, however, which is not in time but
        outside time, it is not future but present. Therefore, we see what is
        future as future because it is future with respect to our seeing, since
        our seeing is itself measured by time; but to the divine vision, which
        is outside of time, there is no future. For example, what one would see
        who is within the ranks of passers-by and sees only those who are in
        line ahead of him is quite different from what he would see were he
        outside their ranks and saw all of them simultaneously. Therefore, the
        fact that our sense of sight is never deceived when it sees contingents
        when they are present does not prevent the contingents themselves from
        happening contingently. In like manner, God infallibly knows all the
        contingents, whether they are present, past, or future to us; for they
        are not future to Him, but He knows that they are when they are; and the
        fact of His knowing them does not prevent them from happening
        contingently.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The difficulty in this matter arises from the fact that we can describe
        the divine knowledge only after the manner of our own, at the same time
        pointing out the temporal differences. For example, if we were to
        describe God’s knowledge as it is, we should have to say that God knows
        that this is, rather than that it will be; for to Him every thing is
        present and nothing is future. For this reason, Boethius says10 that His
        knowledge of future things “is more properly called providence than
        foresight,” since He sees them all, as it were, from a great distance,
        in the mirror of eternity. However, it might also be called foresight
        because of its relation to other things in whose regard what He knows is
        future.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Although a contingent is not determined as long as it is, future,
        yet, as soon as it is produced in the realm of nature, it has a
        determinate truth. It is in this way that the gaze of divine knowledge
        is brought upon it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. As was said, a contingent is referred to divine knowledge according
        to its act of existence in the realm of nature. Moreover, from the
        moment that it is, it cannot not be when it is; for, “what is must be
        when it is,” as is said in <i>Interpretation.</i> It does not follow,
        however, that it is necessary without any qualification or that God’s
        knowledge is defective—just as my sense of sight is not deceived when I
        see that Socrates is sitting, although this fact is contingent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. A contingent is said to be necessary in so far as God knows it,
        because He knows it, not as something already present. Nevertheless, no
        necessity arises from the fact that it is going to be, so that one could
        say that it comes about necessarily; for <i>event</i> applies to
        something which is to be, because what already is cannot eventuate. But
        that it has happened is true, and this is necessary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The necessity referred to in the statement, “Whatever is known by God
        is necessary,” can concern either the manner of speaking or the thing
        spoken about. If the necessity is applied to the manner of speaking,
        then the proposition is composite and true. its meaning will be as
        follows: It is necessary that whatever is known by God exists, since it
        is not possible that God would know something to be and it would not be.
        If the necessity is applied to the thing spoken about. then the
        proposition is divided and false. Its meaning will be as follows: What
        is known by God must necessarily exist. But, as is clear from what has
        been said, things do not happen necessarily simply because God knows
        them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        One might object that this distinction is valid only in regard to forms,
        such as whiteness and blackness, which can succeed one another in a
        subject, but that since it is impossible for something once known by God
        later not to be known by Him, this distinction does not apply here.
        However, we reply that, although God’s knowledge does not change but
        always remains the same, the condition according to which a thing is
        referred to His knowledge does not always remain the same with respect
        to that knowledge. For a thing is related to God’s knowledge as it is in
        its own present existence, yet present existence does not always belong
        to it. Hence, we can consider the thing either together with its
        condition of being present or without it, and, consequently, we can
        consider it either in the manner in which it is referred to God’s
        knowledge or in some other manner. In this way, the afore-mentioned
        distinction is valid.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. If this proposition concerns the thing, then it is true that
        necessity is applied to the thing itself which is known by God; but if
        it concerns the manner of speaking, then the necessity is not applied to
        the thing but to the relation of His knowledge to the thing known.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Neither our science nor God’s knowledge can be about future
        contingents. This would be even more true if He knew them as future. He
        knows them, however, as present to Himself and future to others.
        Therefore, the objection does not stand.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. There have been many opinions about this. Some say that the
        antecedent, “This is known by God,” is contingent because, although it
        refers to something in the past, it nevertheless implies a relation to
        the future, and therefore is not necessary. For example, when it is
        said, “This was going to happen,” the was does not mark the event as
        necessary, since what was going to happen could have failed to do so;
        for, as is said in <i>Generation and Corruption</i>: “He who is about to
        walk, will not walk.” This argument, however, is invalid; for when one
        says, “This is future” or “This was future,” one designates the
        ordination of the causes of that thing to its production. Now, although
        it is possible that the causes ordained to a certain effect can be
        impeded in such a way that the effect will not follow from them, it is
        not possible to prevent their having been at some time ordained to
        produce this effect. Hence, even if that which is future should be able
        not to happen in the future, it will never be able at any time not to
        have been a future.

        For this reason, others say that this antecedent is contingent since it
        is composed of a necessary and a contingent; for God’s knowledge is
        necessary, but what is known by Him is contingent, and each of these is
        included in the antecedent mentioned in the difficulty. For example, the
        following are contingent: “Socrates is a white man,” or “Socrates is an
        animal and he runs.” However, this argument, too, is invalid, for the
        truth of a proposition is not affected by the necessity and contingency
        of that which is affirmed materially in a proposition. The truth of a
        proposition is determined only by the principal composition. Hence, the
        same character of necessity and contingency is found in each of the
        following: “I think that man is an animal” and “I think that Socrates is
        running.” Consequently, since the principal act signified in the
        antecedent, “God knows Socrates is running,” is necessary, no matter how
        contingent the thing may be which is affirmed materially, this still
        does not prevent the afore-mentioned antecedent from being necessary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, others simply concede that the antecedent is necessary. Yet, they
        add, from the fact that an antecedent is absolutely necessary, it need
        not follow that the consequent is absolutely necessary, unless the
        antecedent is the proximate cause of the consequent. If it is the remote
        cause, the necessity of the effect can be impeded by the contingency of
        the proximate cause. For example, even though the sun is a necessary
        cause, the flowering of a tree, its effect, is contingent; for its
        proximate cause, the tree’s germinating power, is not cont1ant. This
        argument, however, does not seem to be sufficient; for it is not due to
        the nature of the cause and effect that a necessary consequence follows
        from a necessary antecedent, but rather to the relation that the
        corisequent has to its antecedent. For the contrary of the consiquent
        can by no means stand with the antecedent. And this would happen if a
        contingent consequent followed from a necessary antecedent. This
        relationship must be found in any true conditional, whether the
        antecedent is the effect, the proximate cause, or the remote cause.
        Moreover, if this relationship is not found in the conditional, the
        proposition is not true at all. Therefore, this conditional is also
        false: “If the sun moves, the tree will flower.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, the difficulty must be solved differently: the antecedent is
        necessary without any qualification, and the consequent is absolute
        necessary in the way in which it follows from the antecedent. For what
        is attributed to a thing in itself is quite different from what is
        attributed to a thing in so far as it is known. What is attributed to it
        in itself belongs to it according to its own manner; but what is
        attributed to a thing or follows upon it in so far as it is known is
        according to the manner of the knower. Hence, if, in the antecedent,
        something is signified which pertains to knowledge, the consequent must
        be taken according to the manner of the knower, not according to the
        manner of the thing known. For example, were I to say, “If I understand
        something, that thing is without matter,” what is understood need be
        immaterial only in so far as it is understood. Similarly, when I say,
        “If God knows something, it will be,” the consequent should not be taken
        according to the mode of being of the thing in itself but according to
        the mode of the knower. For, although a thing in itself is future, it is
        present according to the mode of the knower. Consequently, we should
        rather say, “If God knows something, it is,” than say, “it will be.” We
        must, therefore, judge in the same way the proposition, “If God knows
        something, it will be,” and this one, “If I see Socrates running,
        Socrates is running”; for both are necessary as long as the action is
        going on.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Although a contingent does not exercise an act of existence as long
        as it is a future, as soon as it is present it has both existence and
        truth, and in this condition stands under the divine vision. God,
        however, also knows the relation of one thing to another, and in this
        way He knows that a thing is future in regard to another thing.
        Consequently, there is no difficulty in affirming that God knows
        something as future which will not take place, inasmuch as He knows that
        certain causes are inclined toward a certain effect which will not be
        produced. But when we talk in this way we are not speaking of that
        knowledge of the future by which God sees things in their causes, but of
        that by which He sees a thing in itself. In this latter type of
        knowledge a thing is known as present.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The future, in so far as it is known by God, is present; hence, it
        is determined to one or the other member of a contradiction. But as long
        as it is future it remains open to either.

        11. It is true that God knows nothing outside Himself, if the word
        <i>outside</i> refers to that by <i>which</i> He knows. However, God
        does something outside Himself if this refers to <i>what</i> He knows.
        This point was discussed above.

        12. There are two types of mediums for knowledge. One, the medium of
        demonstration, must be proportionate to the conclusion, so that, when it
        has been posited, its conclusion is posited. God is not such a medium
        for the knowledge of contingents. The other medium of knowledge is that
        which is a likeness of the thing known; and the divine essence is a
        medium of this sort. However, it is not equated with anything, even
        though it is a proper medium for singulars, as was said above.

        5. Any knowledge that can be increased or diminished is subject to
        change. But God’s knowledge can be increased or diminished.
        Therefore.—Proof of the minor is as follows: If a knower at times knows
        more things, at other times fewer, his knowledge changes. Therefore, a
        knower who can know more or fewer things than he now knows possesses
        knowledge subject to change. Now, God can know more than He knows: He
        knows that there are, or were, or will be things made by Him; however,
        He could make more which He is never going to make. Consequently, He
        could know more things than He does. Similarly, He can know fewer than
        He does, since He could do away with a part of what He is going to make.
        Therefore, His knowledge can be increased and diminished.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The answer was given that even though more or fewer things could fall
        under God’s knowledge, His knowledge itself could not change.—On the
        contrary, just as the possibles are subject to divine power, so are
        knowable things subject to divine knowledge. Now, if God could make more
        than He could previously, His power would be increased; and it would be
        diminished if He could make fewer. For the same reason, if He could know
        more than He knew previously, His knowledge would be increased.

        7. At one time God knew that Christ would be born. Now, however, He does
        not know that Christ will be born but that He has been born. Therefore,
        God knows something which He previously did not know, and He has known
        something which now He does not know. Hence, His knowledge is changed.

        8. A manner of knowing, as well as an object of knowledge, is required
        for knowledge. Now, if the manner in which God knows were changed, His
        knowledge would be changed. For the same reason, therefore, when the
        objects of God’s knowledge change, His knowledge will be changed.

        by God’s knowledge through a change, without any detriment to the divine

        Since knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known, it can
        vary in two ways: first, on the part of the knower; second, on the part
        of the thing known. On the part of the knower, we can consider three
        things: his knowledge, his act, and the manner of his act. According to
        these three, changes can take place in knowledge on the part of the
        knower.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On the part of knowledge itself, a change takes place when knowledge
        which was not had previously is newly acquired or when knowledge of what
        was known previously is lost. Accordingly, we can speak of a generation
        or corruption, or of an increase or decrease, in knowledge. Such a
        change, however, cannot take place in God’s knowledge, since, as we have
        shown, its object is not only beings but also non-beings, and there
        cannot be anything beyond being and non-being because between
        affirmation and negation there is no middle ground.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is true that in a certain respect the objects of God’s kriowledge are
        only things existing in the present, Past, or future, namely, in so far
        as His knowledge is ordained to the work which His will carries out.
        However, even if He would know something by this kind of knowledge that
        He did not know previously, there would be no change in His knowledge,
        because on its part it pertains equally to beings and non-beings. If
        there were any change in God, it would be in His will, which would be
        determining His knowledge to something to which it had not previously
        determined it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This, however, could not cause any change in His will, either; for to
        produce its act freely belongs to the nature of the will, because, of
        its very nature, the will is equally able to go out to either of two
        opposites. For example, it can will or not will to make or not to make a
        thing. However, the will cannot make itself simultaneously will and not
        will; nor can the divine will, which is immutable, first wish something
        and later not wish the same thing at the same time, because then God’s
        will would be circumscribed by time and would not be entirely
        simultaneous. If we are speaking of absolute necessity, therefore, it is
        not necessary for Him to wish what He wishes. Therefore, absolutely
        speaking, it is possible for Him not to wish it. On the other hand, if
        we are speaking of the necessity following a supposition, then it is
        necessary that He wish it if He wishes or has wished it. On this
        supposition, then, namely, if He wishes or has wished, it is not
        possible for Him not to wish.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, since a change requires two terms, it always views the final term
        in its relation to the first. Consequently, only this would follow, that
        it would be possible for His will to change if it were possible for Him
        not to wish what He wishes, if He had previously wished. It is clear,
        therefore, that no change is affirmed of His knowledge or will by the
        fact that more or fewer things could be known by God through this kind
        of knowledge; for to say that He is able to know more means simply that
        He can by His will determine His knowledge to make more things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On the part of the act, there are three ways a change takes place in
        knowledge. The first occurs when knowledge actually considers what it
        previously did not consider. For example, we say that a person changes
        who passes from habit to act. Now, this kind of change cannot be found
        in God’s knowledge, because He does not know habitually but only
        actually, since in Him there is no potentiality such as there is in a
        habit. Change is found in a second way in the act of knowing when it
        considers now one thing, now another. But neither can this be found in
        God’s knowledge, since He sees all through the one species of His
        essence, and consequently looks upon all things in the same intuition. A
        third kind of change occurs when, in his contemplation, a person passes
        from one thing to another. But this, too, cannot be found in God, for
        discursive reasoning is a passage between two members, and there is no
        discursive reasoning in knowledge that sees two things if it sees both
        in one intuition. This is what actually takes place in the divine
        knowledge, since God sees all things by one intuition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From the point of view of the manner of knowing, there can also be
        changes in knowledge by reason of the fact that one can now know
        something more clearly and perfectly than he did before. This can arise
        from two sources. First, it can arise from a difference in the medium by
        which the cognition takes place. For example, one may first know
        something through a probable middle term, and later through a middle
        term that is necessary. This, however, cannot take place in God because
        His essence, which for Him is the medium of knowing, never changes.
        Secondly, it can come from the intellectual power which causes a man of
        greater acumen to know something more penetratingly, even through the
        same medium, than another man does. This, too, however, cannot take
        place in God, since the power by which He knows is His own essence, and
        this does not change. Hence, it remains that God’s knowledge does not
        change in any way whatsoever from the point of view of the knower.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But from the point of view of the thing known, knowledge can also change
        in its truth and falsity, because, if a thing is changed while the
        judgment of it remains the same, the judgment which was previously true
        is now false. This, however, cannot take place in God either, since the
        intuition of God’s cognition is directed to a thing as it is in its
        <i>presentness,</i> that is, in so far as it has already received this
        rather than that determination; and in this respect it can change no
        more. Even if that thing should receive another state, that state will
        again fall under the divine vision in the same way; hence, God’s
        knowledge changes in no way whatsoever.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The assimilation of the knower to the thing known does not take place
        through a conformity of nature but through a representation. So, it is
        not necessary for the knowledge of changing things to change.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Although the thing known by God may be other than it is if considered
        in itself, it falls under God’s cognition inasmuch—as it cannot be other
        than it is, as we have already shown.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. All knowledge, whether had by receiving from things or by an
        impression upon the things themselves, takes place according to t e
        manner of the knower, since both take place in so far as a likeness of
        the thing known is in the knower. Moreover, what exists in someone is in
        him according to the manner of him in whom it exists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. That to which God’s knowledge is related is changeless in so far as
        it falls under His knowledge. Therefore, His knowledge does not change,
        either, with respect to its truth, which could be changed by a change of
        the afore-mentioned relation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. When it is said, “God can know what He does not know,” one can
        understand this in two ways—even if we are speaking of His knowledge of
        vision. First, we can understand it in its composite sense, that is, on
        the supposition that God has not known what He is said to be able to
        know. In this sense it is false; for the following two things cannot be
        true simultaneously, namely, that God should have been ignorant of
        something, and later know that thing. The proposition can also be taken
        in a divided sense. In this sense, no supposition or condition of His
        power is included, and in this sense it is true, as is clear from our
        discussion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Although it may, in some sense, be conceded that God can know what He
        did not know previously, we cannot concede in any sense that He can know
        more than He knows; for, since the word <i>more</i> implies a comparison
        to what has previously existed, it is always understood in a composite
        sense. For the same reason, we can in no way concede that God’s
        knowledge can be increased or diminished.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. We concede the sixth argument.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. As we said previously, God knows propositions without joining and
        separating. Just as God knows many different things in the same manner,
        both when they exist and when they do not, so does He know in the same
        manner different propositions, both when they are true and when they are
        false, because He knows each to be true at the time when it is true. For
        example, He knows this proposition, “Socrates is running,” to be true
        when it is true; similarly, this proposition, “Socrates will run,” and
        so forth. Hence, although it is not true now that Socrates is running
        but that he has run, nevertheless, God knows each because He
        simultaneously intuits each time when each proposition is true. If He
        knew a proposition by forming it in Himself, however, then He would know
        a proposition only when it is true, as happens in us. Then His knowledge
        would change.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The manner of knowing is in the knower himself. The thing known,
        however, is not in the knower according to its own nature. Therefore, a
        variation in the manner of knowing would make knowledge vary, but
        changes in the things known would not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. The answer to this is already clear.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. This act of power terminates outside the agent in the thing as it is
        in its own nature—in which the thing has a changeable act of being. So,
        if we consider the thing produced, we must concede that it is given its
        act of existence by means of a change. But knowledge concerns things in
        so far as they are, in some way, in the knower. So, since the knower is
        unchanging, He knows things in an unchanging manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Although God knows other things through His essence, He does not
        pass from one thing to another; for in the same intuition He knows both
        His essence and other things.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Origen says: “A thing will be, not because God knows that it will be,
        but, because it will be, it is known by God before it exists.”’
        Consequently, it seems that things are the cause of His knowledge rather
        than conversely.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Given the cause, the effect follows. But God’s knowledge has been
        from eternity. Therefore, if His knowledge is the cause of things, it
        seems that things have existed from eternity. But this is heretical.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. A necessary effect follows a necessary cause. Hence, even
        demonstrations, which are made through a necessary cause, have necessary
        conclusions. But God’s knowledge is necessary since it is eternal.
        Therefore, all things which are known by God would be necessary. But
        this is absurd.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. If God’s knowledge is the cause of things, then it will be related to
        things in the way in which things are related to our knowledge. But
        things determine the type of knowledge we have; for instance, of
        necessary things we have necessary knowledge. Therefore, if God’s
        knowledge were the cause of things, it would impose the mode of
        necessity on all things. But this is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. A first cause has a more powerful influence upon an effect than a
        second. But, if God’s knowledge is the cause of things, it will be a
        first cause; and, since necessity follows in the effects of necessary
        secondary causes, much more will necessity in things follow from God’s
        knowledge. Thus, the original difficulty stands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Knowledge has a more essential relation to things to which it stands
        as their cause than to things to which it stands as their effect; for a
        cause leaves its impression upon an effect, but an effect does not leave
        its impression upon the cause. Now, our knowledge, which is related to
        things as their effect, requires necessity in the things known if it is
        to be necessary itself. Therefore, if God’s knowledge were the cause of
        things, much more would it demand necessity in the things it knows.
        Consequently, God would not know contingent beings, and, this is
        contrary to what was said previously.

        1. Augustine says: “Not because they are does God know all creatures,
        spiritual and corporeal, but they are because He knows them.” Therefore,
        God’s knowledge is the cause of created things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. God’s knowledge is, in a sense, the art of the things that are to be
        created; hence Augustine says: “The Word is an artistic conception
        filled with the intelligible characters of living things.” But art is
        the cause of artistic products. Therefore, God’s knowledge is the cause
        of created things.

        An effect cannot be more simple than its cause. Consequently, whatever
        things in which one nature is found must be reduced to some one thing
        which is the first subject of that nature, as all hot things are reduced
        to one and the first hot thing, namely, fire, which, as is said in the
        <i>Metaphysics,</i> is the cause of heat in others. Now, since every
        resemblance involves an agreement of forms, whatever things are alike
        are so related that either one is the cause of the other or both are
        caused by one cause. Moreover, in all knowledge there is an assimilation
        of the knower to the known. Hence, either the knowledge is the cause of
        the thing known, or the thing known is the cause of the knowledge, or
        both are caused by one cause. It cannot be said, however, that what is
        known by God is the cause of His knowledge; for things are temporal and
        His knowledge is eternal, and what is temporal cannot be the cause of
        anything eternal. Similarly, it cannot be said that both are caused by
        one cause, because there can be nothing caused in God, seeing that He is
        whatever He has. Hence, there is left only one possibility: His
        knowledge is the cause of things. Conversely, our knowledge is caused by
        things inasmuch as we receive it from things. Angels’ knowledge,
        however, is not caused by things and is not the cause of things, but
        both the things which the angels know and their knowledge are from one
        cause; for in the same way that God communicates universal forms to
        things, making them subsist, He communicates likenesses of things to the
        minds of angels so that the angels can know them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It should be observed, however, that knowledge as knowledge does not
        denote an active cause, no more than does a form as a form. Action
        consists, as it were, in the procession of something from the agent; but
        a form as a form has its act of existence by perfecting that in which it
        is, and by resting in that thing. Consequently, a form is not a
        principle of acting, except through the mediation of a power. In some
        cases, it is true, the form itself is the power, but not by reason of
        being a form. In other cases, the power is other than the substantial
        form of the thing. For example, the actions of bodies do not take place
        without the mediation of certain of their qualities. Similarly,
        knowledge denotes that there is something in the knower, not that
        something has been caused by the knower. Hence, an effect never arises
        from knowledge except through the mediation of the will, which, of its
        very nature, implies a certain influence upon what is willed. For action
        never proceeds from a substance without the mediation of a power,
        although in the case of some substances, such as God, will is identical
        with knowledge. In other substances, namely, all creatures, this is not
        the case. Similarly, effects proceed from God, the first cause of all
        things, through the mediation of secondary causes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, between His knowledge (the cause of the thing) and the thing
        caused there is found a twofold medium: one on the part of God, namely,
        the divine will; another on the part of things themselves in regard to
        certain effects, namely, the medium of secondary causes through whose
        mediation things proceed from God’s knowledge. Moreover, every effect
        follows not only the condition of the first cause but also that of the
        intermediate cause. Hence, the things known by God proceed from His
        knowledge as conditioned by His will and as conditioned by secondary
        causes. Consequently, it is not necessary that these things follow the
        manner of His knowledge in all respects.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Origen’s meaning is that God’s knowledge is not a cause so
        necessitating the thing known that from the very fact that something is
        known by God it must necessarily take place. Moreover, his phrase
        “Because it is to be, it is known by God...” gives the reason for
        concluding that God knows it, not the cause of the divine knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Since things proceed from knowledge through the mediation of the
        will, it is not necessary for them to come into being whenever there is
        knowledge of them, but only when the will determines that they should.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. An effect follows the necessity of its proximate cause, which can
        also be a means of demonstrating the effect. An effect need not follow
        the necessity of the first cause, since an effect can be impeded, if it
        is contingent, by reason of a secondary cause. This is seen in the
        effects produced by the motion of the celestial bodies through the
        mediation of inferior forces on objects subject to generation and
        corruption. Even though the motion of the heavens remains always the
        same, these effects are contingent because the natural forces are
        defective.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. A thing is the proximate cause of our knowledge. Hence, it imposes
        its own mode upon our knowledge. But, since God is a first cause, there
        is no parallel. Or we may say that our knowledge of necessary things is
        necessary, not by reason of the fact that things known cause our
        knowledge, but because of the conformity of the power to the things
        known, which is required for knowledge. Although the first cause
        influences an effect more powerfully than a secondary cause does, the
        effect does not take place without the operation of the secondary cause.
        Hence, if it is possible for the secondary cause to fail in its
        operation, it is possible for the effect not to take place, even though
        the first cause itself cannot fail. The possibility of the effect’s not
        taking place would be much greater if the first cause itself could fail.
        Therefore, since both causes are required for the existence of an
        effect, a failure of either cause will result in a failure of the
        effect. Hence, if contingency is affirmed of either cause, the effect
        will be contingent. But, if only one of the causes is necessary, the
        effect will not be necessary, since both causes are required for the
        existence of the effect. But, because a secondary cause cannot be
        necessary if the first cause is contingent, one can say that the
        necessity of an effect follows the necessity of the second cause.

        2. As is said in the <i>Metaphysics,</i> every being is related to truth
        in the same way as it is related to existence. But evil, as Dionysius
        and Augustine say, is not a being; therefore, it is not something true.
        Now, nothing is known unless it is true. Hence, evil cannot be known by
        God.

        3. The Commentator says that an intellect that is always in act does not

        possible degree. Hence, it knows no privations. But, as Augustine says:
        “Evil is the privation of good.” Therefore, God does not know evil. 4.
        Whatever is known is known either through its likeness or through its
        contrary. Now, evil is not like the divine essence through which God
        knows all things; nor is evil its contrary, for evil cannot harm it—and
        a thing is said to be evil because it is harmful. Therefore, God does
        not know evil things.

        According to the Philosopher, whoever does not understand a thing which
        is one does not understand anything at all. A thing is one, however, by
        being undivided in itself and distinct from others. Hence, whoever knows
        a thing must know its distinction from other things. But the first basis
        of distinction lies in affirmation and negation. Therefore, whoever
        kno’ws an affirmation must know its negation. Now, since privation is
        nothing but a negation having a subject (as is said in the
        Metaphysics”), and since “one of two contraries is always a privation”
        (as is said both in the <i>Metaphysics</i> and <i>Physics</i>)—from the
        very fact that a thing is known, its privation and its contrary are
        known. Accordingly, since God has a proper knowledge of all His effects,
        knowing each one of them as it is, distinct in its own nature, He must
        know all the opposed negations and opposed privations, as well as all
        the contrarieties found in things. Consequently, since evil is the
        privation of good, by knowing any good at all and the measure of any
        thing whatsoever, He knows every evil thing.

        1. That proposition is true about knowledge had from a thing through its
        likeness. But evil is not known to God by its likeness, but through the
        likeness of its opposite. Consequently, it does not follow that God is
        the cause of evil things because He knows them. It follows, rather, that
        He is the cause of the good to which the evil is opposed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. From the fact that non-being is opposed to being, it is said in some
        way to be being, as is clear from the <i>Metaphysics</i>. As a
        consequence, from the fact that evil is opposed to good, it has the
        character of something knowable and of the true.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. It was the opinion of the Commentator that by knowing His essence God
        does not know individual effects in a determined way, that is, as they
        are distinct in their own proper nature, but that He knows only the
        nature of being which is found in all of them. Since evil is not opposed
        to universal but to particular being, it follows from this that God
        would not know evil. But this position is false, as is evident from what
        has been said. Hence, what follows from this position is also false,
        namely, that God does not know privations and evil things. For,
        according to the Commentator, a privation is known by an intellect only
        by the absence of a form from the intellect—a condition that cannot
        exist in an intellect which is always in act. But this is not necessary;
        for, from the very fact that a thing is known, its privation is known.
        Hence, both thing and privation are known through the presence of a form
        in the intellect.

        4. The opposition of one thing to another can be taken in two ways:
        first, in general, as when we say that evil is opposed to good, and in
        this sense, evil is opposed to God; second, in particular, as when we
        say that this white thing is opposed to this black thing, and in this
        sense an evil is opposed only to that good which can be taken away by
        this evil and to which it would be harmful. In this second way evil is
        not opposed to God. Augustine accordingly says: “Vice is opposed to God
        in the way in which evil is opposed to good.” But, to the nature which
        it vitiates, vice is opposed not merely as evil to good but also as
        something harmful to that nature.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. In so far as evil is known, it is a good; for to know evil is a good.
        Thus, it is true that whatever can be learned is a good—not that it is
        good in itself, but that it is good only in so far as it is known.

        6. Grammar is known by possessing the art of grammar. But evil is not
        known by possessing it. Hence, no analogy can be drawn.
