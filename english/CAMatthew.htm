  <blockquote>
    <p>Go up to the top of the mountain, thou that preachest glad tidings in Sion; lift up thy voice with might, thou that preachest in Jerusalem: cry aloud, fear not: say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God! Lo, the Lord God shall come with power, and His arm shall have dominion; Lo, His reward is with Him. [Isaiah xl. 9]
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">The Prophet Isaiah, a manifest preacher of the Gospel, briefly expressing the loftiness, the name, and the substance of the Gospel doctrine, addresses the evangelic teacher in the person of the Lord, saying, �Go up to the top of the mountain, &amp;c.�
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">But to make our beginning with the title, The Gospel.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Augustine</span> , contra Faust., ii, 2: The word, �Evangelium,� (Gospel,) is rendered in Latin �bonus nuntius,� or �bona annuntiatio,� (good news.) It may indeed be used on all occasions whenever any good is announced; but it has come to be appropriated to the announcement of the Saviour.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Gloss</span> .: Those who have related the birth, deeds, words, and sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ, are properly styled Evangelists.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Chrysostom</span> , Homil. in Matt., i, 2: For what is there that can equal these good tidings? God on earth, man in heaven; that long war ceased, reconciliation made between God and our nature, the devil overthrown, death abolished, paradise opened. These things, so far beyond our merits, are given us with all fulness; not for our own toil or labour, but because we are beloved of God.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Augustine</span> , de vera relig, c. 16: Whereas God in many ways heals the souls of men, according to the times and the seasons which are ordained by His [p. 2] marvellous wisdom, yet has He in no way more beneficently provided for the human race, than when the Very Wisdom of God, the Only Son of one substance and coeternal with the Father, stooped to take upon Him perfect man, and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Hereby He made manifest how high a place among creatures had human nature, in that He appeared to men as Very Man.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Pseudo-Aug</span> ., Serm. de Nativ., Serm. ix: God was made man, that man might be made God.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Pope Leo</span> , Epist. ad Flavian., xxviii, 3: For this emptying of himself, by which the Invisible made Himself Visible, and the Creator and Lord of all things choose to become one of us mortal creatures, was a stooping of His mercy, not a failing of His power.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Gloss</span> .: Therefore that the Lord should not be supposed to be present in such a way as that there should be any thing lost of His power, the Prophet adds, �The Lord shall come with power.�
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Aug</span> ., de doct. Christ, i, 12: �Come,� not by passing through the regions of space, but by shewing Himself to men in the flesh.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Aug</span> ., de Peccatorum Meritis, ii, 30: For blood that was without sin being shed, the bond of all men�s sins was done away, by which men were before held captive by the Devil.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Gloss</span> .: Therefore because men, having been delivered from sin by virtue of Christ suffering, became the servants of God, it follows, �And His arm shall have dominion.�
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Leo</span> : In Christ then was given us this wonderful deliverance, that on our passible nature the condition of death should not abide, which His impassible essence had admitted, and that by that which could not die, that which was dead might be brought to life.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Gloss</span> .: And thus through Christ is opened to us the entrance of immortal glory, concerning which it follows, �Lo, His reward is with Him;� that, namely, of which Himself speaks, �Your reward is abundant in heaven.� [Matt 5:12]
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Aug</span> ., contra Faust., iv, 2: The promise of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven belongs to the New Testament; in the Old Testament are contained promises of temporal things.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Gloss</span> .: So then evangelic teaching delivers to us four things [p. 3] concerning Christ; the Divinity that takes upon it, the Humanity that is taken upon it, His Death by which we are delivered from bondage, His Resurrection by which the entrance of a glorious life is opened to us. On this account it is represented in Ezekiel under the figure of the four animals.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Gregory</span> , in Ezek, Hom., iv: The Only-begotten Son of God was Himself verily made Man; Himself condescended to die as the sacrifice of our redemption as a Calf; He rose again through the power of His might, as a Lion; and as an Eagle He ascended aloft into heaven.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Gloss</span> .: In which ascension He shewed manifestly His Divinity; Matthew then is denoted by the Man, because he dwells chiefly on the humanity of Christ; Mark by the Lion, because he treats of His Resurrection; Luke by the Calf, because he insists on His Priesthood; John by the Eagle, because he describes the sacraments of His Divinity.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Ambrose</span> , Comm. in Luc., pref.: And it has happened well that we set out with delivering the opinion that the Gospel according to Matthew is of a moral kind, for morals are the peculiar province of man. The figure of a Lion is ascribed to Mark, because he begins with an assertion of His Divine power, saying, �The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God.� The figure of the Eagle is given to John, because he has described the miracles of the Divine Resurrection.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Greg</span> .: These things the commencement of each of the Gospel books testifies. Because he opens with Christ�s human generation, Matthew is rightly designated by a Man; Mark by a Lion, because he begins with the crying in the desert; Luke by a Calf, because he begins with a sacrifice; because he takes his beginning from the divinity of the Word, John is worthily signified by an Eagle.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Aug</span> ., de Consensu Evang., i, 6: Or, Matthew who has chiefly represented the regal character of Christ, is designated by a Lion; Luke by a Calf, because of the Priest�s victim; Mark, who chose neither to relate the royal nor the priestly lineage [ed. note: The original text of <span style="font-family:Arial; color:blue">Augustine</span> has here, �neque stirpem regiam neque sacerdotalem vel consecrationem vel cognationem.�], and yet is clearly busied about His human nature, is designated by the figure of a Man.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">These three animals, the Lion, the Man, the Calf, walk on the earth, whence these three Evangelists are mostly employed about those things which Christ wrought in the flesh.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">But John, [p. 4] as the Eagle, soars on high, and with most keen eyes of the heart beholds the light of unchangeable Truth. From which we may understand, that the other three Evangelists are occupied about the active, and John about the contemplative, life.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">The Greek Doctors by the Man understood Matthew, because he has deduced the Lord�s lineage according to the flesh; by the Lion, John, because as the lion, strikes terror into the other beasts by his roaring, so John struck terror into all heretics; by the Calf, they understood Luke, because the calf was the victim of the Priests, and he is much employed concerning the Temple and the Priesthood; and by the Eagle they understood Mark, because the eagle in the Divine Scripture is used to denote the Holy Spirit, who spake by the mouths of the Prophets; and Mark begins with a citation from the Prophets.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Jerome</span> , Hier. Prolog. in Evan. Matt. ad <span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Euseb</span> ., Luke 1, 1: Concerning the number of the Evangelists, it should be known, that there were many who had written Gospels, as the Evangelist Luke witnesses, saying, �Forasmuch as many have taken in hand, &amp;c.,� and as books remaining to the present time declare which divers authors have set forth, therein laying the foundation of many heresies; such as the Gospel according to the Egyptians, according to Thomas, Matthias, and Bartholomew [see note, b, just below]; that of the twelve Apostles, and Basilides, and Apelles, and others whom it would be long to reckon up.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">[ed. note, b: These apocryphal compositions are elsewhere mentioned by Clement Alex. (Strom, iii, p. 539, 553) <span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Origen</span> (in Luc. i) <span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Eusebius</span> (Hist. iii. 25) <span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Pseudo-Athan</span> asius (Synops. 76) <span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Cyril</span> (Catech. iv. 36, vi. 31) Epiphanius (Hier, 62, n. 2) <span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Ambrose</span> (in Luc. i. 2) and Pope Gelasius in his Decree.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">The Gospel according to the Egyptians is supposed to be one of the works referred to in the beginning of St. Luke. It was afterwards used by the Gnostics and Sabellians in their defence. There seem to have been several Gospels according to Thomas, one ascribed to a disciple of Manes; one of an earlier date. One is still extant and is one of the two Gospels of our Saviour�s infancy, which seem to be the work of the Gnostics.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">The Gospel according to the Twelve Apostles seems to be the same as the celebrated Gospel according to the Nazarenes, or Hebrews, supposed to have been prior to the inspired Gospels, and afterwards corrupted by the Ebionites. Basilides was a Gnostic, and Apelles a Marcionite. Little is known of the Gospels according to Matthias, and Bartholomew; the former seems to have been of Gnostic origin.]
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">But the Church, which is founded by the Lord�s word upon the rock, sending forth, like Paradise, its four streams, has four corners and four rings, by which as the ark of the covenant, and the guardian of the Law of the Lord, it is carried about on moveable [ed. note: some read, immobilibus] [p. 5] staves.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Aug</span> ., de cons. Evan. i. 2: Or, Because there are four quarters of the world, through the whole of which Christ�s Church is extended. In learning and preaching they had a different order from that they had in writing. In learning and preaching they ranked first who followed the Lord present in the flesh, heard Him teaching, saw Him acting, and by His mouth were sent to preach the Gospel; but in penning the Gospel, an order which we must suppose to have been fixed by Heaven, the first place, and the last place were filled out of the number of those whom the Lord chose before His passion, the first by Matthew, the last by John; so that the other two, who were not of that number, but who yet followed Christ speaking in them, were embraced as sons, and placed in the middle between the other two, so as to be supported by them on both sides.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Remigius</span> : Matthew wrote in Judaea in the time of the Emperor Caius Caligula; Mark in Italy, at Rome, in the time of Nero or Claudius, according to <span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Rabanus</span> ; Luke in the parts of Achaia and Baeotia, at the request of Theophilus; John at Ephesus, in Asia Minor, under Nerva.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Bede</span> : But though there were four Evangelists, yet what they wrote is not so much four Gospels, as one true harmony of four books. For as two verses having the same substance, but different words and different metre, yet contain one and the same matter, so the books of the Evangelists, though four in number, yet contain one Gospel, teaching one doctrine of the Catholic faith.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Chrys</span> .: It had indeed been enough that one Evangelist should have written all; but whereas four speak all things as with one mouth, and that neither from the same place nor at the same time, nor having met and discoursed together, these things are the greatest test of truth.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">It is also a mark of truth that in some small matters they seem to disagree. For had their agreement been complete throughout, adversaries might have supposed that it was by a human collusion that this was brought about. Indeed, in essentials which pertain to direction of life, and preaching the faith, they do not differ in the least thing. And if in their accounts of miracles, one tells it in one way, another in another, let not this disturb you; but think that if one had told all, the other three would have been a needless superfluity; had they all written different things, there would have been no [p. 6] room for proof of their harmony. And if their account differs in times or modes, this does not hinder the truth of the facts themselves which they relate, as shall be shewn below.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Aug</span> .: Though each seems to have followed an order of narration of his own, yet we do not find any one of them writing as if in ignorance of his predecessor, or that he left out some things which he did not know, which another was to supply; but as each had inspiration, he gave accordingly the cooperation of his own not unnecessary labour.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Gloss</span> .: But the sublimity of the Gospel doctrine consists, first, in its preeminent authority.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Aug</span> .: For among all the Divine instruments which are contained in Holy Writ, the Gospel has justly the most excellent place; its first preachers were the Apostles who had seen the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ present in the flesh; and some of them, that is, Matthew and John, published each a book of such things as seemed good to be published concerning Him.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">And that it should not be supposed, that, as far as relates to receiving and preaching the Gospel, it makes any difference whether it is announced by those who followed Him during His sojourn in the flesh, or by those who faithfully believed what they heard from others, it is provided by Divine Providence through the Holy Spirit [ed. note: a clause is inserted here from the original to complete the sense.], that a commission, as well of writing as of preaching the Gospel, should be bestowed on some out of the number of those that followed the first Apostles.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Gloss</span> .: And thus it is clear that the sublimity of the authority of the Gospel is derived from Christ; this is proved by the words of the Prophet cited above, �Go up to the top of the mountain.� For Christ is that Mountain of whom the same Isaiah speaks, �And there shall be in the last days a mountain prepared, the house of the Lord in the top of the mountains;� [Isa 2:2] that is, upon all the saints who from Christ the Mountain are also called mountains; for of His fulness have we all received. And rightly is that, �Go thou up upon a high mountain,� addressed to Matthew, who, as had been foretold, in his own person saw the deeds of Christ, and heard His doctrine.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Aug</span> ., de cons. Evan. i. 7: This should be considered which to many presents a great difficulty, why the Lord Himself wrote nothing, so that we are obliged to give our belief to others who wrote [p. 7] of Him.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Gloss</span> .: But we ought not to say that He wrote nothing, seeing His members have written those things which they learned by the dictation of their Head. For whatever He would have us to read concerning His actions or His words, that He enjoined upon them to write as His own hands.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Gloss</span> .: Secondly, the Evangelic doctrine has sublimity of strength; whence the Apostle says, �The Gospel is the power of God to the salvation of all that believe.� [Rom 1:16] The Prophet also shews this in the foregoing words, �Lift up thy voice with might;� which further marks out the manner of evangelic teaching, by that raising the voice which gives clearness to the doctrine.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">How then do we say that Christ was born by the Holy Spirit, if the Holy Spirit did not beget Him? Did He create Him? For so far as He is man He was created, as the Apostle speaks; �He was made of the seed of David according to the flesh.� [Rom 1:3] For though God made the world, yet is it not right to say that it is the Son of God, or born by Him, but that it was made, or created, or formed by Him. But seeing that we confess Christ to have been born by the Holy Spirit, and of the Virgin Mary, how is He not the Son of the Holy Spirit, and is the Son of the Virgin? It does not follow, that whatever is born by any thing, is therefore to be called the son of that thing; for, not to say that of man is born in one sense a son, in another a hair, or vermin, or a worm, none of which are his son, certainly those that are born of water and the Spirit none would call sons of water; but sons of God their Father, and their Mother the Church. Thus Christ was born of the Holy Spirit, and yet is the Son of God the Father, not of the Holy Spirit.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">In like manner, �until� often denotes in Scripture, as he has shewn, a fixed period, but often also an infinite time, as in that, �Even to your old age I am He.� [Isa 46:4] Will God then cease to be when they are grown old? Also the Saviour in the Gospel, �Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of this world.� [Matt 28:20] Will He then leave His disciples at the end of the world? Again, the Apostle says, �He must reign till He has put His enemies under His feet.� [1 Cor 15:25]

Supposing an Evangelist thought the very notion shocking that Joseph should have considered the Blessed Virgin as his wife after he was a witness of her bearing God the Son, he would only say that the vision had its effect upon him up to that time when it was no longer necessary. Just as if, in speaking of a man like <span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Augustine</span> , one said, that, in consequence of some awful occurrence, he was in the habit of saying prayers till the time of his conversion, no one would suppose that he left them off on being converted.]

The followers of Eunomius think, as they have dared to assert this, that Joseph also dared to do it, just as the insane think all men equally mad with themselves.

The Lord therefore sends carnal tribulation on his servants, that the flesh fearing its own pains, may not lust after evil.

For in forty days of fasting not to have been �an hungred� was not as man; to be ever �an hungred� was not as God.

Luke again, even before relating one of Christ�s actions, tells that �Herod had shut up John in prison.� The Apostle John then was requested to put into writing what the preceding Evangelists had left out before the imprisonment of John; hence he says in his Gospel, �this beginning of miracles did Jesus.�

For Peter and Andrew had not so seen Jesus at the Jordan that they adhered inseparably ever after, but so as only to have known who He was, and wondering at Him to have gone their way.

We may then understand that the narrative of Luke relates to a prior time, after which they returned to their fishing as usual. For it had not been said to Peter that he should no more catch fish, as he did do so again after the resurrection, but that he �should catch men.� Again, at a time after this happened that call of which Matthew and Mark speak; for they draw their ships to land to follow Him, not as careful to return again, but only anxious to follow Him when He bids them.

To those that mourn, comfort, as to persons who know what they had lost, and in what they were immersed. To the hungry, [p. 158] plenty, as a refreshment to those who labour for salvation.

For the Lord has shewed us that even a wicked motion of the thoughts to the wrong of a brother is to be accounted a kind of murder.

To this the heretic [p. 167] Faustus replies [ed. note: Faustus was of Milevis in Africa and a Bishop and controversialist of the Manichees. He was a man of considerable abilities. <span style="font-family: Arial;color:blue">Augustine</span> was first his hearer, and in after years his opponent; and in his work against him he answers him seriatim. In this way the treatise of Faustus is preserved to us.], Whose testimony is there that Christ spoke this? That of Matthew.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">How was it then that John does not give this saying, who was with Him in the mount, but only Matthew, who did not follow Jesus till after He had come down from the mount? To this <span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Augustine</span> replies, If none can speak truth concerning Christ, but who saw and heard Him, there is no one at this day who speaks truth concerning Him.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Why then could not Matthew hear from John�s mouth the truth as Christ had spoken, as well as we who are born so long after can speak the truth out of John�s book? In the same manner also it is, that not Matthew�s Gospel, but also these of Luke and Mark are received by us, and on no inferior authority. And, that the Lord Himself might have told Matthew the things He had done before He called him.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">But speak out and say that you do not believe the Gospel, for they who believe nothing in the Gospel but what they wish to believe, believe themselves rather than the Gospel. To this Faustus rejoins, We will prove that this was not written by Matthew, but by some other hand, unknown, in his name. For below he says, �Jesus saw a man sitting at the toll-office, Matthew by name.� [Matt 9:9] Who writing of himself say, �saw a man,� and not rather, �saw me?� <span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Augustine</span> ; Matthew does no more than John does, when he says, �Peter turning round saw that other disciple whom Jesus loved;� as it is well known that this is the common manner of Scripture writers, when writing their own actions.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Faustus again, But what say you to this, that the very assurance that He was not come to destroy the Law and the Prophets, was the direct way to rouse their suspicions that He was? For He had yet done nothing that could lead the Jews to think that this was His object. <span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Augustine</span> ; This is a very weak objection, for we do not deny that to the Jews who had no understanding, Christ might have appeared as threatening the destruction of the Law and the Prophets.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Faustus; But what if the Law and the Prophets do not accept this fulfilment, according to that in Deuteronomy, �These commandments [p. 168] I give unto thee, thou shalt keep, thou shalt not add any thing to them, nor take away.� <span style="font-family:Arial; color:blue">Augustine</span> ; Here Faustus does not understand what it is to fulfil the Law, when he supposes that it must be taken of adding words to it. The fulfilment of the Law is love, which the Lord hath given in sending His Holy Spirit. The Law is fulfilled either when the things there commanded are done, or when the things there prophesied come to pass.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Faustus; But in that we confess that Jesus was author of a New Testament, what else is it than to confess that He has done away with the Old? <span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Augustine</span> ; In the Old Testament were figure of things to come, which, when the things themselves were brought in by Christ, ought to have been taken away, that in that very taking away the Law and the Prophets might be fulfilled wherein it was written that God gave a New Testament.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Faustus; Therefore if Christ did say this thing, He either said it with some other meaning, or He spoke falsely, (which God forbid,) or we must take the other alternative, He did not speak it at all. But that Jesus spoke falsely none will aver, therefore He either spoke it with another meaning, or He spake it not at all. For myself I am rescued from the necessity of this alternative by the Manichaean belief, which from the first taught me not to believe all those things which are read in Jesus� name as having been spoken by Him; for that there be many tares which to corrupt the good seed some nightly sower has scattered up and down through nearly the whole of Scripture.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Augustine</span> ; Manichaeus taught an impious error, that you should receive only so much of the Gospel as does not conflict with your heresy, and not receive whatever does conflict with it. We have learned of the Apostle that religious caution, �Whoever preaches unto you another Gospel than that we have preached, let him be accursed.� [Gal 1:8] The Lord also has explained what the tares signify, not things false mixed with the true Scriptures, as you interpret, but men who are children of the wicked one.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Faustus; Should a Jew then enquire of you why you do not keep the precepts of the Law and the Prophets which Christ here declares He came not to destroy but to fulfil, you will be driven either to accept an empty superstition, or to repudiate [p. 169] this chapter as false, or to deny that you are Christ�s disciple.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Augustine</span> ; The Catholics are not in any difficulty on account of this chapter as though they did not observe the Law and the Prophets; for they do cherish love to God and their neighbour, �on which hang all the Law and the Prophets.� And whatever in the Law and the Prophets was foreshewn, whether in things done, in the celebration of sacramental rites, or in forms of speech, all these they know to be fulfilled in Christ and the Church. Wherefore we neither submit to a false superstition, nor reject the chapter, nor deny ourselves to be Christ�s disciples. He then who says, that unless Christ had destroyed the Law and the Prophets, the Mosaic rites would have continued along with the Christian ordinances, may further affirm, that unless Christ had destroyed the Law and the Prophets, He would yet be only promised as to be born, to suffer, to rise again. But inasmuch as He did not destroy, but rather fulfil them, His birth, passion, and resurrection, are now no more promised as things future, which were signified by the Sacraments of the Law; but He is preached as already born, crucified, and risen, which are signified by the Sacraments now celebrated by Christians.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">It is clear then how great is the error of those who suppose, that when the signs or sacraments are changed, the things themselves are different, whereas the same things which the Prophetic ordinance had held forth as promises, the Evangelic ordinance points to as completed.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Faustus: Supposing these to be Christ�s genuine words, we should enquire what was His motive for speaking thus, whether to soften the blind hostility of the Jews, who when they saw their holy things trodden under foot by Him, would not have so much as given Him a hearing; or whether He really said them to instruct us, who of the Gentiles should believe, to submit to the yoke of the Law. If this last were not His design, then the first must have been; nor was there any deceit or fraud in such purpose.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">For of laws there be three sorts. The first that of the Hebrews, called the �law of sin and death,� [Rom 8:2] by Paul; the second that of the Gentiles, which he calls the law of nature, saying, �By nature the Gentiles do the deeds of the law;� [Rom 2:14] the third, the law of [p. 170] truth, which he means, �The law of the Spirit of life.� Also there are Prophets some of the Jews, such as are well known; others of the Gentiles as Paul speaks, �A prophet of their own hath said;� [Tit 1:12] and others of the truth of whom Jesus speaks, �I send unto you wise men and prophets.� [Matt 23:34]
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Now had Jesus in the following part of this Sermon brought forward any of the Hebrew observances to shew how he had fulfilled them, no one would have doubted that it was of the Jewish Law and Prophets that He was now speaking; but when He brings forward in this way only those more ancient precepts, �Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery,� which were promulged of old to Enoch, Seth, and the other righteous men, who does not see that He is here speaking of the Law and Prophets of truth? Wherever He has occasion to speak of any thing merely Jewish, He plucks it up by the very roots, giving precepts directly the contrary; for example, in the case of that precept, �An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.�
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Augustine</span> ; Which was the Law and which the Prophets, that Christ came �not to subvert but to fulfil,� is manifest, to wit, the Law given by Moses. And the distinction which Faustus draw between the precepts of the righteous men before Moses, and the Mosaic Law, affirming that Christ fulfilled that one but annulled the other, is not so. We affirm that the Law of Moses was both well suited to its temporary purpose, and was not now subverted, but fulfilled by Christ, as will be seen in each particular. This was not understood by those who continued in such obstinate error, that they compelled the Gentiles to Judaize - those heretics, I mean, who were called Nazarenes.

For the Apostle directs either that she remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband. There is this difference in the separation, namely, which of them was the cause of it. If the wife put away the husband and marry another, she appears to have left her first husband with the desire of change, which is an adulterous thought. But if she have been put away by her husband, yet he who marries her commits adultery, how can she be quit of the same guilt?

Monach., 23: Some argue that they ought not to labour, because the fowls of the air neither sow nor reap. Why then do they not attend to that which follows, �neither gather into barns? Why do they seek to have their hands idle, and their storehouses full? Why indeed do they grind corn, and dress it? For this do not the birds.

But not to lay up any thing for the morrow cannot be observed by those, who for many days together withdrawn from the sight of men, and suffering none to approach to them, shut themselves up, to live in much fervency of prayer.

What He says respecting the birds of the air, He says to this end, that none of His servants should think that God has no thought of their wants, when they see Him so provide even for these inferior creatures. Neither is it not God that feeds those that earn their bread by their own labour; neither because God hath said, �Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee,� [Ps 50:15] ought the Apostle therefore not to have fled, but to have remained still to have been seized, that God might save him as He did the Three Children out of the midst of the fire.

In like manner, such of God�s servants as have [p. 253] strength to earn their food by the labour of their hands, would easily answer any who should object to them this out of the Gospel concerning the birds of the air, that they neither sow nor reap; and would say, If we by sickness or any other hindrance are not able to work, He will feed us as He feeds the birds, that work not. But when we can work, we ought not to tempt God, seeing that even this our ability is His gift; and that we live here we live of His goodness that has made us able to live; He feeds us by whom the birds of the air are fed; as He says, �Your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much greater value?�

But nothing prevents all individuals from perishing; when no power watches over them. If again, He be unwilling, this must be from one of two reasons; inactivity, or the meanness of the occupation. But inactivity is produced by two things; either we are drawn aside by some pleasure, or hindered by some fear, neither of which can be piously supposed of God. If they affirm that it [p. 260] would be unbecoming, for that it is beneath such blessedness to stoop to things so trifling, how is it not inconsistent that a workman overseeing the whole of any machine, leaves no part however insignificant without attention, knowing the whole is but made up of the parts, and thus pronounce God the Creator of all things to be less wise than craftsmen? But if it be that He is unable, then is He unable to bestow benefits on us. But if we are unable to comprehend the manner of special Providence, we have not therefore any right to deny its operation; we might as well say that, because we did not know the number of mankind, therefore there were no men.

For what evil great or small would not a father undergo, that he might see and enjoy a most dear son? Let us then think the same of that glory; for there is no son so dear to his father as is the rest of the [p. 286] good, to be deceased and to be with Christ.

But it was the multitude that wondered, that is the common people, not the chief among the people, who are not wont to hear with the desire of learning; but the simple folk heard in simplicity; had others been present they would have broken up their silence by contradicting, for where the greater knowledge is, there is the stronger malice.

But it is not the soul of the dead man that then cries out, the daemon assumes his voice to deceive the hearers. For if the soul of a dead man has power to enter the body of another, much more might it enter its own. And it is more unreasonable to suppose that a soul that has suffered cruelty should cooperate with him that injured it, or that a man should have power to change an incorporeal being into a different kind of substance, such as a human soul into the substance of a daemon.

So that when we find cases in which one is recorded by one Evangelist, and another by another, and some difference which we cannot reconcile between their accounts, we should suppose that they are like, but not the same, events.

It is clear that this precept of the Lord does not at all imply that they ought not according to the Gospel to live by any other means, than by the contributions of those to whom they preached; otherwise Paul transgressed this precept when he lived by the labour of his own hands. But He gave the Apostles authority that these things were due to them from the house in which they abode. But when the Lord has issued a command, if it be not performed, it is the sin of disobedience; when He bestows a privilege, it is in any one�s power not to use it, and as it were to refrain from claiming his right.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">The Lord then having sanctioned this maxim, that they who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel, He spoke these things to the Apostles, that being confident they should not possess nor carry about with them the necessaries of life, neither things great nor things small. Therefore He adds, �Nor a staff,� [p. 374] to shew that from His people all things are due to His ministers, and they require no superfluities. This authority He signifies by the staff, saying in Mark, �Take nothing but a staff only.� [Mark 6:18] And when He forbids them (in Matthew) to take with them shoes, He forbids that carefulness and thought which would be anxious to carry them lest they should be wanting.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Thus also we must understand concerning the two coats, that none should think it necessary to carry another besides that which he wore, supposing that he should have need of it; for it would be in his power to obtain one by this authority which the Lord gave. Further that we read in Mark that they should be shod with sandals, seems to imply that this kind of shoe has a mystic meaning in it, that the foot should neither be covered above, nor yet bare beneath, that is, that the Gospel should not be hid, nor yet rest itself on earthly advantage.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Also when He forbids them to carry two coats, He warned them not to walk deceitfully, but in simplicity. So we cannot doubt that all these things were said by the Lord, partly in a direct, partly in a figurative sense; and that of the two Evangelists one inserted some things, the other things, in his narrative. If any one should think that the Lord could not in one speech speak some things in a direct, and some things in a mystic sense, let him look at any other of His sayings, and he will see how hasty and unlearned his opinion is.

And this is the predestination of the saints, namely, the foreknowledge and making ready the mercies of God, by which they are most certainly saved, whosoever are saved. The rest are left to the just judgment of God in the general body of the condemned, where they of Tyre and Sidon are left, who might have believed had they seen Christ�s many miracles; but since it was not given them that they should believe, therefore that through which. they might have believed was also withheld.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">From which it appears, that there are certain who have in their dispositions by nature a divine gift of understanding by which they would be moved to faith, if they should either hear words or see signs adapted to their minds. But if they be not by the high sentence of God set apart from the mass of perdition through the predestination of grace, then neither words nor works are set before them by God, which yet, could they have seen or heard them, would have stirred them to believe.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">In this general mass of perdition are the Jews also left, who could not believe so great and manifest wonders wrought before their eyes. And the cause wherefore they could not believe, the Gospel hath not hidden, speaking thus; �Though he did so great miracles before them, yet could they not believe, as Esaias said, I have blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart.� [John 12:37]
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Not in this [p. 423] way then were the eyes of they of Tyre and Sidon blinded, or their heart hardened, for they would have believed had they seen such wonders as these saw. But it profited those not that they could have believed, for that they were not predestinated; neither would it have been any hindrance to these that they had not power to believe, had they been so predestined that God should have enlightened their blindness, and taken away the heart of stone from within them.

Ev., ii, 32: Luke also gives this as spoken in continuation of some other of the Lord�s discourses; from which it appears that he has rather followed the actual order of events; Matthew to have followed his recollection.

For it is by no means the same thing to violate the sabbath, and to touch that sacred table, which is lawful for none.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">For who could not be convicted of having spoken a word against the Holy Spirit, before He become a Christian or a Catholic? First, the Pagans themselves when they say that Christ wrought miracles by magic arts, are they not like those who said that He cast out daemons by the Prince of the demons? Likewise the Jews and all such heretics as confess the Holy Spirit, but deny that He is in the body of Christ, which is the Church Catholic, are like the Pharisees, who denied that the Holy Spirit was in Christ.

The Photinians also say, that the Father only is God, and that the Son is nothing more than a man, and deny altogether that there is any third Person, the Holy Spirit.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">It is clear then that the Holy Spirit is blasphemed, both by Pagans, Jews, and heretics. Are all such then to be left out, and looked upon as having no hope? For if the word they have spoken against the Holy Spirit is not forgiven them, then in vain is the promise made to them, that in Baptism or in the Church they should receive the forgiveness of their sins.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">For it is not said, �It shall not be forgiven him in Baptism;� but, �Neither in this world, nor in the world to come;� and so they alone are to be supposed clear of the guilt of this most heavy sin who have been Catholics from their infancy.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">But whence this meaning can be proved, I know not; since place for penitence of sins however great was never denied in the Church, and even heretics are exhorted to embrace it by the Apostle.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">The stain of this sin is so great, that it may not submit to the humility of prayer, even when the sinful conscience is driven to acknowledge and proclaim its own sin. Which state of mind because of the greatness of their sin we must suppose some may be brought to; and this perhaps may be to sin against the Holy Ghost, that is through malice and jealousy to assail brotherly charity after having received the grace of the Holy Spirit; and this sin the Lord declares shall be forgiven neither in this world, nor in that to come.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Whence it may be enquired whether the Jews sinned this sin against the Holy Ghost when they said that the Lord cast out daemons by Beelzebub the Prince of the daemons.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Seeing they thus spoke out of jealousy, ungrateful for so great present benefits, are they, though not Christians, to be supposed by the very greatness of that jealousy to have sinned the sin against the Holy Spirit? This cannot be gathered from the Lord�s words. Yet He may seem to have warned them that they should come to grace, and that after that grace received they should not sin as they now sinned.

Let us then seek the light of exposition from the Lord. I say unto you, beloved, that in all Holy Scripture there is not perhaps so great or so difficult a question as this.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">First then I request you to note that the Lord said not, Every blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven, nor, Whoso shall speak any word against—but, �Whoso shall speak the word.�
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Wherefore it is not necessary to think that every blasphemy and every word spoken against the Holy Spirit shall be without pardon; it is only necessary that there be some word which if spoken against the Holy Spirit shall be without pardon. For such is the manner of Scripture, that when any thing is so declared in it as that it is not declared whether it is said of the whole, or a part, it is not necessary that because it can apply to the whole, it therefore is not to be understood of the part. As when the Lord said to the Jews, �If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin,� [John 15:22] this does not mean that the Jews would have been altogether without sin, but that there was a sin they would not have had, if Christ had not come.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">What then is this manner of speaking against the Holy Ghost, comes now to be explained. Now in the Father is represented to us the Author of all things, in the Son birth, in the Holy Spirit community of the Father and the Son. What then is common to the Father and the Son, through that they would have us have communion among ourselves and with them; �The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which he hath given us,� [Rom 5:5] and because by our sins we were alienated from the possession of true goods, �Charity shall cover the multitude of sins.� [1 Pet 4:8] And for that Christ forgives sins through the Holy Spirit, hence may be understood how, when He said to his disciples, �Receive ye the Holy Spirit,� [Jon 20:22] He subjoined straight, �Whosoever sins ye forgive, they shall be forgiven them.�
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">The first benefit therefore of them that believe [p. 459] is forgiveness of sins in the Holy Spirit. Against this gift of free grace the impenitent heart speaks; impenitence itself therefore is the blasphemy against the Spirit which shall not be forgiven, neither in this world, nor in that to come.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">For indeed he speaks the evil word against the Holy Spirit either in his thought, or with his tongue, who by his hard and impenitent heart treasures up for himself wrath against the day of wrath. Such impenitence truly has no forgiveness, neither in this world nor in the world to come, for penitence obtains forgiveness in this world which shall hold in the world to come.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">But that impenitence as long as any lives in the flesh may not be judged, for we must despair of none so long as the patience of God leads to repentance. For what if those whom you discover in any manner of sin, and condemn as most desperate, should before they close this life betake themselves to penitence, and find true life in the world to come?
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">But this kind of blasphemy though it be long, and comprised in many words, yet the Scripture is wont to speak of many words as one word. It was more than a single word which the Lord spoke with the prophet, and yet we read, The word which came unto this or that prophet.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Here perhaps some may enquire whether the Holy Spirit only forgives sins, or the Father and the Son likewise. We answer the Father and the Son likewise; for the Son Himself saith of the Father, �Your Father shall forgive you your sins,� [Matt 6:14] and He saith of Himself, �The Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins.� [Matt 9:6]
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Why then is that impenitence which is never forgiven, spoken of as blasphemy against the Holy Spirit only? Forasmuch as he who falls under this sin of impenitence seems to resist the gift of the Holy Spirit, because in that gift is conveyed remission of sin. But sins, because they are not remitted out of the Church, must be remitted in that Spirit by which the Church is gathered into one. Thus this remission of sins which is given by the whole Trinity is said to be the proper office of the Holy Spirit alone, for it is He, �The Spirit of adoption, in which we cry, Abba Father,� [Rom 8:15] so that to Him we may pray, �Forgive us our sins; And hereby we know:� speaks John, �that Christ abideth in us, by the Holy Spirit which He hath given unto us.� [1 John 4:13]
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">For to [p. 460] Him belongs that bond by which we are made one body of the only-begotten Son of God; for the Holy Spirit Himself is in a manner the bond of the Father and the Son. Whosoever then shall be found guilty of impenitence against the Holy Spirit, in whom the Church is gathered together in unity and one bond of communion, it is never remitted to him.

The Jews were indeed ignorant of Christ, but of the Holy Ghost they had had a sufficient communication, for the Prophets spake by Him. What He here saith then is this; Be it that ye have stumbled at Me because of the flesh which is around Me; but can ye in the same manner say of the Holy Spirit, We know Him not? Wherefore this blasphemy cannot be forgiven you, and ye shall be punished both here and hereafter, for since to cast out daemons and to heal diseases are of the Holy Spirit, you do not speak evil against Me only, but also against Him; and so your condemnation is inevitable both here and hereafter.

Special, as all Christians are called brethren, as the Saviour says, �Go tell my brethren.� [John 20:17] General, inasmuch as all men are born of one father, we are bound together by a tie of consanguinity, as in that, �Say unto them that hate you, Ye are our brethren.� [Isa 66:5]

By affection, either of a human sort, or of the Spirit? If that be true, yet how were they more His brethren than the Apostles, whom He instructed in the inmost mysteries. Or if because they were men, and all men are brethren, it was foolish to say of them in particular, Behold, thy brethren seek thee.

Or perhaps we should not say amiss thus—that some of the Jews were capable of being healed, but that being puffed up with so great swelling pride, it was good for them at first that they should not believe, that they might understand the Lord speaking in parables, which if they did not understand they would not believe; and thus not believing on Him, they together with the rest who were past hope crucified Him; and at length after His resurrection, they were converted, when humbled by the guilt of His death they loved Him the more because of the heavy guilt which had been forgiven them; for their so great pride needed such an humiliation to overcome it.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">This might indeed be thought an inconsistent explanation, did we not plainly read in the Acts of the Apostles [margin note: Acts 2:37] that thus it was. This then that John says, �Therefore they could not believe, because he hath blinded their eyes that they should not see,� is not repugnant to our holding that they were therefore blinded that they should be converted; that is to say, that the Lord�s meaning was therefore purposely clothed in the obscurities of parables, that after His resurrection they might turn them to wisdom with a more healthy penitence. For by reason of the darkness of His discourse, they being blinded did not understand the Lord�s sayings, and not [p. 489] understanding them, they did not believe on Him, and not believing on Him they crucified Him; thus after His resurrection, terrified by the miracles that were wrought in His name, they had the greater compunction for their great sin, and were more prostrated in penitence; and accordingly after indulgence granted they turned to obedience with a more ardent affection. Notwithstanding, some there were to whom this blinding profited not to conversion.

Suppose then that after these words the Lord looked upon the multitude and said what John relates, but Matthew and the others have omitted. And by such cases as this none ought to be perplexed, when one of the Evangelists relates what the rest have omitted.

But because the disciples were yet attracted to earth, the Lord begins to introduce the things that were of Himself; �He saith unto them, Bring them hither to me.�
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Wherefore does He not create out of nothing the bread to feed the multitude with? That He might put to silence the mouth of Marcion and Manichaeus, who take away from God His creatures, [margin note: i.e. deny that God created the visible world] and by His deeds might teach that all things that are seen are His works and creation, and that it is He that has given us the fruits of the earth, who said in the beginning, �Let the earth bring forth the green herb;� [Gen 1:11] for this is no less a deed than that. For of five loaves to make so many loaves, and ashes in like manner, is no less a thing than to bring fruits from the earth, reptiles and other living things from the waters; which shewed Him to be Lord both of land and sea.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">By the example of the disciples also we ought to be taught, that though we should have but little, we ought to give that to such as have need.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Why did He look to heaven and bless? For it should be believed concerning Him that He is from the Father, and that He is equal with [p. 534] the Father. His equality He shews when He does all things with power.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">To prove these two things therefore, He works His miracles at times with power, at other times with prayer. It should be considered also that in lesser things He looks to heaven, but in greater He does all with power. When He forgave sins, raised the dead, stilled the sea, opened the secrets of the heart, opened the eyes of him that was born blind, which were works only of God, He is not seen to pray; but when He multiplies the loaves, a work less than any of these, He looks up to heaven, that you may learn that even in little things He has no power but from His Father.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">And at the same time He teaches us not to touch our food, until we have returned thanks to Him who gives it us.

The Jewish nation, boasting themselves to be a part of God, call those meats common, of which all men partake; for example, swine�s flesh, shell fish, hares, and those species of animals that do not divide the hoof, and chew the cud, and among the fish such as have not scales. Hence in the Acts of the Apostles we read, �What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.� [Acts 10:15] Common then in this sense is that which is free to the rest of mankind, and as though not in part of God, is therefore called unclean.

That animal is reckoned unclean in the law because it does not chew the cud; but this is not its fault but its nature. But the men of whom this animal is the emblem, are impure by their own fault, not by nature; they readily hear the words of wisdom, but never think upon them again.

For that was a time when it behoved not in words only, but in deeds, to prophesy those things which hereafter were to be revealed.

And though at the time of the former miracle Christ had done many things to the end that they should remember it, making them distribute the loaves, and divide the baskets among them, yet they were still imperfectly disposed, as appears from what follows; �And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitude?�
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">This they spoke out of the [p. 570] infirmity of their thoughts, yet thereby making the ensuing miracle to be beyond suspicion; for that none might suspect that the loaves had been got from a neighbouring village, this miracle is wrought in the wilderness far distant from villages.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Observe also their wisdom in another respect, how they had overcome their appetite, taking so little care of their meals, that though they had been three days in the desert, yet they had with them only seven loaves.

It is a either that the basket [margin note: sporta] in this miracle is of larger capacity than the basket [margin note: cophinus] in the former, or that by this point of difference they might remember the two separate miracles; for which reason also He then made the number of baskets equal to the number of the disciples, but now to the number of the loaves.

But why said He to Peter, �Thou art an offence unto me, when in the Psalm it is said, Great peace have they that love thy law, and there is no offence to them?� [Ps 119:165] It must be answered, that not only is Jesus not offended, but neither is any man who is perfect in the love of God; and yet he who does or speaks any thing of the nature of an offence, may be an offence even to one who is incapable of being offended.

In truth, the Lord was transformed into that glory in which He shall hereafter come in His Kingdom. The transformation enhanced the brightness, but did not destroy [p. 601] the countenance, although the body were spiritual; whence also His raiment was changed and became white to such a degree, as in the expression of another Evangelist, no fuller on earth can whiten them. But all this is the property of matter, and is the subject of the touch, not of spirit and ethereal, an illusion upon the sight only beheld in phantasm.

For the Word of God has various forms, appearing to each man according as He knows that it will be expedient for him; and He shews Himself to none in a manner beyond his capacity; whence he says not simply, �He was transfigured,� but, �before them.�
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">For Jesus, in the Gospels, is merely understood by those who do not mount by means of exalting works and words upon the high mountain of wisdom; but to them that do mount up thus, He is no longer known according to the flesh, but is understood to be God the Word. Before these then Jesus is transfigured, and not before those who live sunk in worldly conversation. But these, before whom He is transfigured, have been made sons of God, and He is shewn to them as the Son of righteousness. His raiment is made white as the light, that is, the words and sayings of the Gospels with which Jesus is clothed according to those things which were spoken of Him by the Apostles.

The first is this; because the multitudes said He was Elias, or Jeremias, or one of the Prophets, He here [p. 602] brings with Him the chief of the Prophets, that hence at least may be seen the difference between the servants and their Lord.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Another reason is this; because the Jews were ever charging Jesus with being a transgressor of the Law and blasphemer, and usurping to Himself the glory of the Father, that He might prove Himself guiltless of both charges, He brings forward those who were eminent in both particulars; Moses, who gave the Law, and Elias, who was jealous for the glory of God.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Another reason is, that they might learn that He has the power of life and death; by producing Moses, who was dead, and Elias, who had not yet experienced death. A further reason also the Evangelist discovers, that He might shew the glory of His cross, and thus soothe Peter, and the other disciples, who were fearing His death; for they talked, as another Evangelist declares, �of His decease which He should accomplish at Jerusalem.�
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Wherefore He brings forward those who had exposed themselves to death for God�s pleasure, and for the people that believed; for both had willingly stood before tyrants, Moses before Pharaoh, Elias before Ahab. Lastly, also, He brings them forward, that the disciples should emulate their privileges, and be meek as Moses, and zealous as Elias.

For seeing in this place great quietness and solitude, he thought that this would be a fit place to take up their abode in, saying, �Lord, it is good for us to be here.� And he sought to remain here ever, therefore he proposes the tabernacles, �If thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles.� For he concluded if he should do this, Christ would not go up to Jerusalem, and if He should not go up to Jerusalem, He should not die, for he knew that there the Scribes laid wait for Him.

In that Peter says, �Lord, if thou wilt,� he shews the submission of a dutiful and obedient servant.

Anselm: It is to be observed, that the mystery of the second regeneration, that, to wit, which shall be in the resurrection, when the flesh shall be raised again, agrees well with the mystery of the first which is in baptism, when the soul is raised again. For in the baptism of Christ is shewn the working of the whole Trinity; there was the Son incarnate, the Holy Ghost appearing in the figure of a dove, and the Father made known by the voice. In like manner in the transfiguration, which is the sacrament of the second regeneration, the whole Trinity appeared; the Father in the [p. 606] voice, the Son in the man, and the Holy Spirit in the cloud.

And he who prays with his fasting, has two wings, lighter than the winds themselves. For he is not heavy and wandering in his prayers, (as is the case with many,) but his zeal is as the warmth of fire, and his constancy as the firmness of the earth. Such an one is most able to contend with daemons, for there is nothing more powerful than a man who prays properly.

For if the Gentiles are with such difficulty withdrawn from the irrational worship of idols, how much more hardly shall the Jews be withdrawn from the reasonable service of God?

For the priests who ministered in the temple their apportioned time, when their office of ministration was discharged, withdrew to this village to abide; as also did they who were to take their place.

Ev., ii, 66: In this quotation from the Prophet, there is some variety in the different Gospels. Matthew quotes it as if the Prophet had expressly mentioned the she-ass; but it is not so quoted by John [marg. note: John 12:15], nor in the Church-copies of the translation in common use. This seems to me to be accounted for by the account, that Matthew wrote his Gospel in the Hebrew language. And it is clear that the translation called the LXX, has some things different from what are found in the Hebrew, by those who know that tongue, and who have rendered the same books out of the Hebrew. If the reason of this discrepancy be asked, I consider nothing more likely than that the LXX interpreted with the selfsame spirit with which the original was written, which is confirmed by that wonderful agreement among them of which we are told.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">By thus varying the expression, while they did not depart from the meaning of that God whose words they were, they convey to us the very same thing as we gather from this agreement, with slight variety, among the Evangelists. This shews us that it is no lie, when one relates any thing with such diversities in detail, as that he does not depart from his intention with whom he ought to agree. To know this is useful in morals in avoiding lies; and for faith itself, that [p. 706] we should not suppose that the truth is secured in sacred sounds, as though God imparted to us not the matter only, but the words in which the matter is conveyed. Rather the matter is in such sort conveyed in words, that we ought not to want words at all, if it were possible that the matter could be known by us without words, as God and His Angels know it.

And if Matthew had not mentioned the colt, as they do not mention the ass, the reader ought not to have been surprised. How much less then should it move him, when one has so mentioned the ass which the others have omitted, as not to forget the colt which they have mentioned. For there is no discrepancy where both circumstances may have occurred, though one only related one, and another; how much less then where one mentions both, though another mentions only one?

For John relates, that six days before the Passover He came to Bethany, [John 12:1] and on the morrow sitting on the ass entered Jerusalem. In this observe the correspondence between the Old and New Testaments, not only in things but in seasons. For on the tenth day of the first month, the lamb that was to be sacrificed for the passover was to be taken into the house, [marg. note: Ex 12:3] because on the same day of the same month, that is, five days before the passover, the Lord was to enter the city in which He was to suffer.

Further, it was the part of a good physician, that having entered to heal the sick city, he should first apply himself to the source of the sickness; for as every thing good cometh out of the temple, so also doth every evil. For when the priesthood is sound, the whole Church flourishes, but if it is corrupt, faith is impaired; and as when you see a tree whose leaves are pale-coloured you know that it is diseased at its root, so when you see an undisciplined people conclude without hesitation that their priesthood is unsound.

But it would happen that those who came from a distance would have no victim.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">The Priests therefore contrived a plan for making a gain out of the people, selling to such as had no victim the animals which they had need of for sacrifice, and themselves receiving them back again as soon as sold. But this fraudulent practice was often defeated by the poverty of the visitors, who lacking means had neither victims, nor whence to purchase them. They therefore appointed bankers who might lend to them under a bond. But because the Law forbade usury, and money lent without interest was profitless, besides sometimes a loss of the principal, they bethought themselves of another scheme; instead of bankers they appointed �collybistae,� a word for which the Latin has no equivalent.

At the same time Hesychius himself makes its proper sense to be �a kind of coin, with an ox stamped on the brass.� Pollux and Suidas and others agree with this interpretation, so far as to make the word stand for a small coin. Hence Collybists were those who gave change in small coin. <span style="font-family: Arial;color:blue">Origen</span> too, to whom St. <span style="font-family:Arial; color:blue">Jerome</span> is indebted for a great part of his exposition, understands by Collybists those who change good coin for bad, to the injury of those who employ them.� Vallars, in loc.]

But if we must express more closely the three kinds of men cast out of the Temple, we may say thus. Whosoever among a Christian people spend their time in nothing else but buying and selling, continuing but little in prayers or in other right actions, these are the buyers and sellers in the Temple of God. Deacons who do not lay out well the funds of their Churches, but grow rich out of the poor man�s portion, these are the money-changers whose tables Christ overturns.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Mark also, that through the avarice of the Priests, the altars of God are called tables of money-changers. What we have spoken of Churches let each man understand of himself, for the Apostle says, �Ye are the temple of God.� [2 Cor 6:16] Let there not be therefore in the abode of your breast the spirit of bargaining, nor the desire of gifts, lest Jesus, entering in anger and sternness, should purify His temple not without scourging, that from a den of thieves He should make it a house of prayers.

But He says, �The Publicans and harlots,� a class rather of Jews [p. 727] than of Gentiles. Unless this is to be taken as was said above; So much rather the Gentile people please God than you, that even the Publicans and harlots are more acceptable to Him than you.

And the elder son represents the people; because the people is not for the sake of the Priests, but the Priests are for the sake of the people.

The first is in a sort carnal, that we should love God even with our flesh, which we cannot do unless we first depart from the love of the things of this world. The love of the heart is felt in the heart, but the love of the soul is not felt, but is perceived because it consists in a judgment of the soul. For he who believes that all good is in God, and that without Him is no good, he loves God with his whole soul. But to love God with the whole mind, is to have all the faculties open and unoccupied for Him. He only loves God with his whole mind, whose intellect ministers to God, whose wisdom is employed about God, whose thoughts travail in the things of God, and whose memory holds the things which are good.

Be strict in ordering your own life, in that of others lenient; let men hear of you as enjoining little, and performing much.

But if any man asserts that the daemons have no bodies, we would not pugnaciously contend the point. For why may we not say, that truly, though wonderfully, even incorporeal spirit [p. 866] can feel pain of corporeal fire? If the spirits of men, though themselves incorporeal, can be now inclosed in bodily limbs, they can then be inseparably attached to the bonds of body. The daemons then will be united to a body of material fire, though themselves immaterial, drawing punishment from their body, not giving life to it. And that fire being material will torture such bodies as ours with their spirits; but the daemons are spirits without bodies.

And when for any enormous crime a man is punished with death, does the law estimate his punishment by the delay that takes place in putting him to death, and not rather by this, that they remove him for ever from the society of the living?

He who does this to Christians, anoints the Lord�s feet, for they are the Lord�s feet; and this penitents are most found to do for remission of their sins. He who devotes himself to chastity, and continues in fastings and prayers, and other things which conduce to God�s glory only, this is the ointment which anoints the Lord�s head, and with whose odour the whole Church is filled; this is the work meet not for penitents, but for the perfect, or the doctrine which is necessary for men; but the acknowledgment of the faith which belongs to God alone, is the ointment with which the head of Christ is anointed, with which we �are buried together with Christ by baptism into death.� [Rom 6:4]

But the disciples, anxious for the salvation of Israel, say that this ought to have been sold for the use of the poor; designating by a prophetic instinct the Jews, who lacked faith, by the name of the poor. The Lord answers that there is abundant time in which they may shew their care for the poor, but that salvation cannot be extended to the Gentiles [p. 883] but by obedience to His command, if, that is, by the pouring out of this woman�s ointment they are buried together with Him, because regeneration can only be given to those who are dead in the profession of baptism. And this her work shall be told wherever this Gospel is preached, because when Israel draws back, the glory of the Gospel is preached by the belief of the Gentiles.

For the sum of Peter�s denials is three; if the first then had been after the first cock-crowing, the other three Evangelists must be wrong when they make the Lord say that Peter should deny Him before the cock crow. But, on the other hand, if be had made all three denials before the cock began to crow, it would be superfluous in Mark to say, �Before the cock crow twice.� Forasmuch as this threefold denial was begun before the first cock-crow, the three Evangelists have marked, not when it was to be concluded, but how often it was to happen, and when to begin, that is, before cock-crow.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Though indeed if we understand it of Peter�s heart we may well say, that the whole denial was complete before the first cock-crow, seeing that before that his mind was seized with that great fear which wrought upon him to the third denial. Much less therefore ought it to disquiet us, how the three-fold denial in three distinct speeches was begun, but not finished before cock-crow. Just as though one should say, Before cock-crow you will write me a letter, in which you will revile me three times; if the letter were begun before any cock-crow, but not finished till after the first, we should not therefore say that the prediction was false.

But his presumptuous confidence, prompted by zeal indeed but not a cautious zeal, became the cause not only of offence but of a thrice repeated denial. And since He confirmed it with the sanction of an oath, some one will say that it was not possible that he should not have denied Him. For Christ would have [p. 903] spoken falsely when he, said, �Verily I say unto thee,� if Peter�s assertion, �I will not deny thee,� had been true.

Moreover observe how after the resurrection, taught by his fall, he speaks to Christ more humbly, and does not any more resist His words. All this his fall wrought for him; for before he had attributed all to himself, when he ought rather to have said, I will not deny Thee if Thou succour me with Thy aid.

Was it then at all unbeseeming that Peter after this sin should become ruler of the Church, as Moses after smiting the Egyptian was made ruler and chief of the Synagogue? For both transgressed the rule not through hardened ferocity, but through a warmth of spirit capable of good; both through hatred of the injustice of others; both sinned through love, the one for his brother, the other for his Lord, though a carnal love.

It was not fit that the Lord should answer the High Priest�s adjuration as though under compulsion, wherefore He neither denied nor confessed Himself to be the Son of God. For he was not worthy to be the object of Christ�s teaching, therefore He does not instruct him, but taking up his own words retorts them upon him.

It might have been done after the ninth hour, when Judas, seeing the [p. 934] Saviour dead and the veil of the temple rent, the earthquake, the bursting of the rocks, and the elements terrified, was seized with fear and sorrow thereupon. But after the ninth hour the Chief Priests and Elders were occupied, as I suppose, in the celebration of the Passover; and on the Sabbath, the Law would not have allowed him to bring money. Therefore it is to me as yet unproved on what day or at what time Judas ended his life by hanging.

Therefore with the price of the Lord�s blood the potter�s field is purchased. We read in Scripture that the salvation of the whole human race has been purchased by the Saviour�s blood. This field then is the whole world. The potter who is the Lord of the soil, is He who has formed of clay the vessels of our bodies. This potter�s field then was purchased by Christ�s blood, and to strangers who without country or home wander over the whole world, repose is provided by Christ�s blood.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Aug</span> ., de Cons.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">But I do not like this defence, because the more, and the more ancient, copies have Hieremias, and there could be no reason for adding the name, and thus making an error. But its erasure is well accounted for by the hardihood of ignorance having heard the foregoing objection urged. It might be then, that the name Hieremias occurred to the mind of Matthew as he wrote, instead of the name Zacharias, as so [p. 936] often happens; and that be would have straightway corrected it, when pointed out to him by such as read this while he yet lived in the flesh, had he not thought that his memory, being guided by the Holy Spirit, would not thus have called up to him one name instead of another, had not the Lord determined that it should thus be written.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">And why He should have so determined, the first reason is, that it would convey the wonderful consent of the Prophets, who all spake by one Spirit, which is much greater than if all the words of all the Prophets had been uttered through the mouth of one man; so that we receive without doubt whatever the Holy Spirit spake through them, each word belongs to all in common, and the whole is the utterance of each. Suppose it to happen at this day, that in repeating another�s words one should mention not the speaker�s name, but that of some other person, who however was the other�s greater friend, and then immediately recollecting himself should correct himself, he might yet add, Yet am I right, if you only think of the close unanimity that exists between the two. How much more is this to be observed of the holy Prophets!
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">There is a second reason why the name Hieremias should be suffered to remain in this quotation from Zacharias, or rather why it should have been suggested by the Holy Spirit. It is said in Hieremias, that he bought a field of his brother�s son, and gave him silver for it, [Jer 32:9] though not indeed the sum stated in Zacharias, thirty pieces of silver. That the Evangelist has here adapted the thirty pieces of silver in Zacharias to this transaction in the Lord�s history, is plain; but he may also wish to convey that what Hieremias speaks of the field is mystically alluded to here, and therefore he puts not the name of Zacharias who spoke of the thirty pieces of silver, but of Hieremias who spoke of the purchase of the field. So that in reading the Gospel and finding the name of Hieremias, but not finding there the passage respecting the thirty pieces of silver, but the account of the purchase of the field, the reader might be induced to compare the two together, and so extract from them the sense of the prophecy, how far it refers to what was now accomplished in the Lord.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">For what Matthew adds to the prophecy, �Whom they of the children of Israel [p. 937] did value, and gave them for the potter�s field, as the Lord appointed me,� this, �as the Lord appointed me,� is found neither in Zacharias nor Hieremias. It must then be taken in the person of the Evangelist as inserted with a mystic meaning, that he had learned by revelation that the prophecy referred to this matter of the price for which Christ was betrayed.

And this obscuration we saw begin from the east, and so pass to the extreme of the sun�s orb, and again return back the same way, being thus the very reverse of an ordinary eclipse.

Phlegon indeed has recorded such an event as happening in the time of Tiberius Caesar, but he has not mentioned that it was at the full moon. I think therefore that, like the other miracles which took place at the Passion, the rending of the veil, and the earthquake, this also was confined to Jerusalem.

Accordingly we might suppose many and dense clouds to have been brought together over Jerusalem and Judaea, enough to produce thick darkness from the sixth to the ninth hour. For we understand that there were two creatures created on the sixth day, the beasts before the sixth hour, man on the sixth; and therefore it was fitting that He who died for the salvation of man should be crucified at the sixth hour, and for this cause that darkness should be over the whole earth from the sixth to the ninth hour. And as by Moses stretching out his hands towards heaven darkness was brought upon the Egyptians who held the servants of God in bondage, so likewise when at the sixth hour Christ stretched out his hands on the cross to heaven, darkness came over all the people who had cried out, [p. 957] �Crucify him,� and they were deprived of all light as a sign of the darkness that should come, and that should envelop the whole people of the Jews. Further, under Moses there was darkness over the land of Egypt three days, but all the children of Israel had light; so under Christ there was darkness over all Judaea for three hours, because for their sins they were deprived of the light of God the Father, the splendour of Christ, and the illumination of the Holy Spirit.

And consider the time when this is done; at mid-day, while over the whole world it was day, that all the dwellers on the earth might perceive it. This is the sign He promised to them that asked Him, �An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign, and there shall no sign be given it save the sign of Jonas the Prophet,� [Matt 12:39] alluding to His cross and resurrection.

Because the human race was at that time plunged in exceeding sluggishness and vice, and this wonder was but one, and quickly past away, and none cared to search out its cause, or perhaps they attributed it to eclipse, or some other physical consequence.

The complaint of His being deserted is the weakness of the dying man; the promise of Paradise is the kingdom of the living God. You have Him complaining that He is left to death, and thus He is Man; you have Him as He is dying declaring that He reigns in Paradise; and thus He is God.

For seeing the Divine power shines forth so brilliant in the contemplation of its works, it is an argument of boundless love, that it suffers for its subjects, dies for its bondsmen.

Therefore Christ�s Godhead experienced death through its partaking of humanity or of human feeling, which it had voluntarily taken on it; but it lost not the properties of its nature by which it gives life to all things. For when we die, without doubt the loss of life by the body is not the destruction of the soul, but the soul quitting the body loses not its own properties, but only lets go what it had quickened, and as far as in it lays produces the death of somewhat else, but itself defies death. To speak now of the Saviour�s soul; it might depart without being itself destroyed from His body for this three days� space, even by the common laws of death, and without taking into account the indwelling Godhead, and His singular righteousness. For I believe that the Son of God died not in punishment of unrighteousness which He had not at all, but according to the law of that nature which He took upon Him for the redemption of the human race.

We ought therefore to believe without hesitation that they who rose from the dead at the Lord�s resurrection, ascended also into heaven together with Him.

Ev., iii, 24: Concerning the hour when the women came to the sepulchre [p. 974] there arises a question not to be overlooked. Matthew here says, �On the evening of the Sabbath.� What then means that of Mark, �Very early in the morning, the first day of the week?� [Mark 16:2]
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Truly Matthew, by naming the first part of the night, to wit, the evening, denotes the whole night in the end of which they come to the sepulchre. But seeing the Sabbath hindered them from doing this before, he designates the whole night by the earliest portion of it in which it became lawful for them to do whatever, during some period of the night, they designed to do.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Thus, �On the evening of the sabbath,� is just the same as if he had said, On the night of the sabbath, i.e. the night which follows the day of the sabbath, which is sufficiently proved by the words which follow, �As it began to dawn towards the first day of the week.� This could not be if we understood only the first portion of the night, its beginning, to be conveyed by the word, �evening.� For the evening or beginning of the night does not �begin to dawn towards the first day of the week,� but only the night which is concluded by the dawn.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">And this is the usual mode of speaking in Holy Scripture, to express the whole by a part. By �evening� therefore he implied the night, in the end of which they came to the sepulchre.

This has been so shortly described by Matthew, that it is not quite clear in his account, but the other Evangelists give the order more distinctly. The Lord was buried on the sixth day of the week, and the women returning from the sepulchre prepared spices and ointments as long as it was lawful to work; on the sabbath they rested, according to the commandment, as Luke plainly declares; and when the Sabbath was past and the evening was come, and the season of labour returned, with zealous devotion they proceeded to purchase such spices as they yet lacked, (this is implied in Mark�s words, �when the sabbath was past,� that they might go and anoint Jesus, for which purpose they come early in the morning to the sepulchre.

With this purpose he says, �On the evening of the Sabbath.� For whereas according to the wonted succession of the hours of the day, evening does not dawn towards day, but on the contrary darkens towards night, these words shew that the Lord shed, by the light of His resurrection joy and brilliance over the whole of this night.

But now most fitly night goes before day, when, through faith in the resurrection, we are brought back from the darkness of sin and the shadow of death to the light of life, by the bounty of Christ.

And it is not, They come, but �came,� (in the singular,) for in mystery and not by accident, the two came under one name. She came, but altered; a woman, changed in life, not in name; in virtue, not in sex. The women go before the Apostles, bearing to the Lord�s sepulchre a type of the Churches; the [p. 976] two Marys, to wit.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">For Mary is the name of Christ�s mother; and one name is twice repeated for two women, because herein is figured the Church coming out of the two nations, the Gentiles and the Jews, and being yet one. Mary came to the sepulchre, as to the womb of the resurrection, that Christ might be the second time born out of the sepulchre of faith, who after the flesh had been born of her womb; and that as a virgin had borne Him into this life present, so a sealed sepulchre might bring Him forth into life eternal. It is proof of Deity to have left a womb virgin after birth, and no less to have come forth in the body from a closed sepulchre.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">And here it is to be noted, that even before His resurrection the Angels knew that they were subjected to the man Christ. Christ then desiring that it should be also known to men that all power was committed to Him in heaven and in earth, sent preachers to make known the word of life to all nations; whence it follows, �Go ye therefore, and teach all nations.�

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Hereby let the Jews be put to silence, who say that Christ�s coming is to be for their salvation only. Let the Donatists also blush, who, desiring to confine Christ to one place, have said that He is in Africa only, and not in other countries.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Jerome</span> : They first then teach all nations, and when taught dip them in water. For it may not be that the body receive the sacrament of Baptism, unless the soul first receive the truth of the Faith. �In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,� that they whose Godhead is one should be conferred at once, to name this Trinity, being to name One God.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Chrysol</span> , Serm. 80: Thus all nations are created a second time to salvation by that one and the same Power, which created them to being.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Jerome</span> , Didymi Lib. ii, de Spir. Sanct.: And though some one there may be of so averse a spirit as to undertake to baptize in such sort as to omit one of these names, therein contradicting Christ Who ordained this for a law, his baptism will effect nothing; those who are baptized by him will not be at all delivered from their sins. From these words we gather how undivided is the substance of the Trinity, that the Father is verily the Father of the Son, and the Son verily the Son of the Father, and the Holy Spirit the Spirit of both the Father and the Son, and also the Spirit of wisdom and of truth, that is, of the Son of God. This then is the salvation of them that believe, and in this Trinity is wrought the perfect communication of ecclesiastical discipline.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Hilary</span> , de Trin. ii, 1 &amp;c: For what part of the salvation of men is there that is not [p. 989] contained in this Sacrament? All things are full and perfect, as proceeding from Him who is full and perfect. The nature of His relation is expressed in the title Father; but He is nothing but Father; for not after the manner of men does He derive from somewhat else that He is Father, being Himself Unbegotten, Eternal, and having the source of His being in Himself, known to none, save the Son.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">The Son is the Offspring of the Unbegotten, One of the One, True of the True, Living of the Living, Perfect of the Perfect, Strength of Strength, Wisdom of Wisdom, Glory of Glory; the Image of the Unseen God, the Form of the Unbegotten Father.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">Neither can the Holy Spirit be separated from the confession of the Father and the Son. And this consolation of our longing desires is absent from no place. He is the pledge of our hope in the effects of His gifts, He is the light of our minds, He shines in our souls.
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">These things as the heretics cannot change, they introduce into them their human explanations. As Sabellius who identifies the Father with the Son, thinking the distinction to be made rather in name than in person, and setting forth one and the same Person as both Father and Son. As Ebion, who deriving the beginning of His existence from Mary, makes Him not Man of God, but God of man. As the Arians, who derive the form, the power, and the wisdom of God out of nothing, and in time. What wonder then that men should have diverse opinions about the Holy Spirit, who thus rashly after their own pleasure create and change the Son, by whom that Spirit is bestowed?
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Jerome</span> : Observe the order of these injunctions. He bids the Apostles first to teach all nations, then to wash them with the sacrament of faith, and after faith and baptism then to teach them what things they ought to observe; �Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.�
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Raban</span> .: �For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.� [James 2:26]
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue">Chrys</span> .: And because what He had laid upon them was great, therefore to exalt their spirits He adds, �And, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.� As much as to say, Tell Me not of the difficulty of these things, seeing I am with you, Who can make all things easy. A like promise He often made to the Prophets in the Old Testament, to Jeremiah who pleaded his [p. 990] youth, to Moses, and to Ezekiel, when they would have shunned the office imposed upon them. And not with them only does He say that He will be, but with all who shall believe after them. For the Apostles were not to continue till the end of the world, but He says this to the faithful as to one body.

As much as to say, The grievous things which you shall undergo, terminate with this present life, seeing that even this world shall come to an end, but the good things which ye shall enjoy endure for ever.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:3.0pt; margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify">What is said of His human nature is distinct from what is said of His divine nature. He is going to His Father in His human nature, He abides With His disciples in that form in which He is equal with the Father. When He says, �to the end of the world,� He expresses the infinite by the finite; for He who remains in this present world with His elect, protecting them, the same will continue with them after the end, rewarding them.
