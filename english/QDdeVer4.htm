    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It seems that there cannot be, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. There are two kinds of words: exterior and interior. An exterior word
    cannot be predicated properly of God since it is material and passing. Nor
    can an interior word be predicated of God, for Damascene defines it as
    follows: “Speech that is internally expressed is a motion of the soul,
    produced in the process of thinking, and not orally enunciated.” Now, motion
    or a process of thinking cannot be said to exist in God. Hence, it seems
    that there cannot be a word, properly speaking, in Him.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Augustine proves that some word belongs to the mind, because something is
    also said to be the mouth of the mind, as is evident in the Gospel according
    to St. Matthew (15:18): “But the things which proceed out of the mouth...
    these defile a man.” That this means the mouth of the heart is clear from
    what follows: “But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth
    from the heart” (15:18). Now, a mouth cannot be predicated of spiritual
    things except metaphorically. Hence, neither can a word.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. That the Word is a medium between the creator and creatures is shown from
    St. John (1:3) where we read: “All things were made by him.” From this
    passage, Augustine proves that the Word is not a creature. Using the same
    proof, we can show that the Word is not the creator. Consequently, the Word
    affirms nothing which is in God. A medium is equidistant from extremes. Now,
    if the Word is the medium between the Father who utters and the creature
    which is uttered, the Word should be essentially distinct from the Father,
    since He is essentially distinct from creatures. But there is nothing in the
    divine Persons which is distinguished by the divine essence. Hence, a word,
    properly speaking, cannot be in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Whatever belongs to the Son in so far as He is incarnate is not properly
    predicated of God, as, for example, to be man, to walk, or anything of this
    sort. But being the Word belongs to the Son only in so far as He is
    incarnate, because it is the nature of a word to manifest the one who is
    speaking. The Son, however, manifests the Father only in so far as the Son
    is incarnate, just as our words manifest our understanding only in so far as
    they are expressed vocally. Hence, a word, properly speaking, does not exist
    in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. If the Word, properly speaking, existed in God, the Word existing
    eternally in the Father and that which was made Incarnate in time would be
    the same—just as we say that it is the same Son. But it seems that we cannot
    say this, because the Incarnate Word is compared to a word vocally
    expressed; the Word existing in the Father, however, is compared to a mental
    word. This is clear from what Augustine has written. Now, the word that is
    vocally expressed is not the same as that existing in the heart. Therefore,
    it does not seem that the Word which is said to have existed eternally in
    the Father properly pertains to the divine nature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. The later in a series an effect occurs, the more does it have the nature
    of a sign. For example, wine is the final cause of a wine jar, and, more
    remotely, of the circular tag which is attached to the jar as a marker; for
    this reason, the tag is more truly a sign than the jar is. Now, a word that
    is vocally expressed is the last effect of the procession from the
    intellect. Consequently, the nature of a sign belongs to the vocal word more
    than to the mental concept, and, similarly, the nature of a word belongs
    more to the external expression from the fact that it manifests something.
    Now, whatever exists in its primary sense in material things and not in
    spiritual things is not properly predicated of God. Therefore, a word cannot
    be properly predicated of God. 8. Every noun especially signifies that from
    which it has been derived. But <i>verbum</i> (word) is derived either from
    <i>verberatio aeris</i> (a disturbing of the air) or from
    <i>boatus</i> (shout), so that <i>verbum</i> means simply
    <i>verum boans</i> (shouting what is true). Hence, this is what is
    especially signified by the noun <i>verbum.</i> Now, this cannot be said to
    be in God except metaphorically. Therefore, a word, properly speaking, is
    not in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. The word that one says seems to be a likeness of the thing spoken,
    existing in the speaker. But when the Father knows Himself, He knows Himself
    not by means of a likeness, but by means of His essence. Consequently, it
    seems that by intuiting Himself the Father does not generate any word of
    Himself. “Now, with reference to the Highest Spirit, <i>to speak</i> means
    simply to intuit in thought,” as Anselm says. Hence, a word, properly
    speaking, does not exist in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. Whenever anything resembling a creature is predicated of God, it is not
    predicated of Him properly, but only metaphorically. Now, as Augustine
    says,6 the Word in God resembles the word which is in us. Hence, it seems
    that a word can be predicated of God metaphorically, but not properly.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. Basil says that God is called the Word because all things are uttered by
    Him, and that He is called the wisdom by which all things are known, and the
    light by which all things are made manifest. However, to utter is not
    properly predicated of God, because uttering pertains to the voice.
    Consequently, word is not predicated of God in its proper sense.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. The vocal word is related to the Incarnate Word as the mental word is
    related to the eternal Word. This is clear from Augustine.” The vocal word,
    however, is predicated only metaphorically of the Word Incarnate. Hence, the
    interior word is also predicated only metaphorically of the eternal Word.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Augustine says: “The Word which we are trying to make you understand is
    knowledge with love.” Now, knowledge and love are predicated of God in their
    proper sense. Hence, so is the Word.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Augustine says: “The word which is heard exteriorly is a sign of the word
    shining within; and to this latter the name <i>word</i> more properly
    belongs. For the vocalization of the word by a physical mouth is merely the
    voice of the word; and it also is called a word because of that from which
    it has been taken in order that the interior word might itself appear
    externally. It is clear from this that the term <i>word</i> belongs more
    properly to the spiritual than to the material word. Now, whatever is found
    more properly in spiritual things than in material things most properly
    belongs to God. Therefore, word is predicated of God in its most proper
    sense.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Richard of St. Victor says that a word manifests the meaning of one who
    is wise. But the Son manifests the meaning of the Father in the truest way
    possible. Hence, word is predicated of God in the most proper sense.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. According to Augustine, the word is “thought, fully formed.” Now, God’s
    contemplation is never capable of formation, but is always fully formed,
    since it is always in act. Consequently, a word, in the most proper sense,
    is predicated of God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    51. Among the types of oneness, that which is most simple is called one
    primarily and most properly. The same is true of a word—that which is most
    simple is called a word in the most proper sense. Now, the Word that is in
    God is most simple; hence, it is most properly called a word.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. According to grammarians, the part of speech called the verb receives
    this general name <i>verbum</i> as its own because it is a perfection of the
    entire sentence, and is, as it were, the most important part of it.
    Moreover, other parts of the sentence are expressed by the verb, since the
    noun is understood in it. Now, the divine Word <i>(Verbum) is</i> the most
    perfect of all things and expresses all things. Therefore, it is called a
    word in the most proper sense.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    We give names to things according to the manner in which we receive our
    knowledge from things. Hence, since those things which come after others in
    the order of nature are usually the ones that we know first, it frequently
    happens that, in applying names to things, we first use a name of one of two
    things when the reality it signifies primarily exists in the second. We have
    a clear example of this in the names that are used of both God and
    creatures. <i>Being, good,</i> and words of this sort are first applied to
    creatures, and then transferred from creatures to God, even though the act
    of existence and the good are found primarily in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Consequently, since the exterior word is sensible, it is more known to us
    than the interior word; hence, according to the application of the term, the
    vocal word is meant before the interior word, even though the interior word
    is naturally prior, being the efficient and final cause of the exterior.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It is the final cause, indeed, because we use the exterior word to manifest
    the interior. Hence, the interior word is that which is expressed by the
    exterior. Moreover, the exterior word signifies that which is understood,
    not the act of understanding, nor the habit or faculty, as the objects of
    understanding, unless the habit and the faculty are themselves the things
    that are understood. Consequently, the interior word is what is understood
    interiorly. Again, the interior word is the efficient cause of the word
    spoken exteriorly, for, since the meaning of a word is arbitrary, its
    principle is the will—just as the will is the principle of other products.
    Moreover, just as there preexists in the mind of a craftsman a certain image
    of his external work, so also does there pre-exist in the mind of one who
    pronounces an exterior word a certain archetype of it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Consequently, just as we consider three things in the case of a craftsman,
    namely, the purpose of his work, its model, and the work now produced, so
    also do we find a threefold word in one who is speaking. There is the word
    conceived by the intellect, which, in turn, is signified by an exterior
    vocal word. The former is called <i>the word of the heart,</i> uttered but
    not vocalized. Then there is that upon which the exterior word is modeled;
    and this is called <i>the interior word</i> which has an image of the vocal
    word. Finally, there is the word expressed exteriorly, and this is called
    <i>the vocal word. Now,</i> just as a craftsman first intends his end, then
    thinks out the form of his product, and finally brings it into existence, so
    also, in one who is speaking, the word of the heart comes first, then the
    word which has an image of the oral word, and, finally, he utters the vocal
    word.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Now, because the vocal word is expressed by means of a body, such a word
    cannot be predicated of God except metaphorically, that is, only in the
    sense in which creatures or their motions, being produced by God, are said
    to be His word inasmuch as they are signs of the divine intellect as effects
    are signs of their cause. For the same reason, the word which has an image
    of the vocal word cannot be properly predicated of God, but only
    metaphorically. Consequently, His ideas of things to be made are called the
    Word of God only metaphorically. But the word of the heart—that which is
    actually considered by the intellect—is predicated properly of God, because
    it is entirely free of matter, corporeity, and all defects; and such things
    are properly predicated of God, for example, knowledge and the known,
    understanding and the understood.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Since the interior word is that which is understood and is within us only
    in so far as we actually understand, it always demands that the intellect be
    in its act, which is to understand. Now, the act of understanding is called
    a motion, not a motion of what is imperfect, such as is described in the
    <i>Physics</i>, but a motion of what is perfect-an operation, as is
    described in <i>The Soul.</i> It is in this sense that Damascene spoke of
    the interior word as a motion of the mind, because motion is taken for that
    in which the motion terminates; that is, operation is taken for the term of
    the operation, just as the act of understanding is taken for the understood.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Moreover, the notion of the mental word does not require that the act of the
    intellect which terminates in a mental word take place by means of some
    reasoning process which thinking seems to involve. It is enough that
    something is actually understood—no matter how this takes place. But because
    <i>we</i> usually speak interiorly by means of a reasoning process,
    Damascene and Anselm in defining a word use <i>thinking</i> instead of
    <i>consideration.</i>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Augustine’s argument is not from a parallel but from the lesser to the
    greater. For, if one can speak of the heart as having a mouth, he can with
    greater verisimilitude speak of it as containing a word. Hence, the argument
    proves nothing.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. A medium can be understood in two ways. First, it can be understood as
    being a medium between the two terms of a motion, as pale is a medium
    between white and black in a process of blackening or whitening. Second, it
    can be understood as existing between what is active and what is passive, as
    the instrument of the artist is a medium between the artist and his work. In
    fact, anything by which the artist acts is a medium in this sense. It is in
    this second sense, too, that the Son is a medium between the creating Father
    and the creature created through the Word. The Son, however, is not a medium
    between God creating and the creature created, for the Word is also God
    creating. Hence, just as the Son is not a creature, so also He is not the
    Father.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    There is still another reason why the conclusion does not follow. We say
    that God creates by means of His wisdom predicated essentially; hence, His
    wisdom can be called a medium between God and creature. Yet, this very
    wisdom is God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    In the argument cited, moreover, Augustine is proving that the Word is not a
    creature, not because He is a medium, but because He is the universal cause
    of creatures. Now, every motion is reduced to some first mover which is
    itself unmoved at least relatively to the motion in question, just as all
    things which undergo qualitative change must be reduced to some first thing
    which causes this change but is itself not changed in this way. Similarly,
    that to which all created beings are reduced must itself be uncreated.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. A medium understood as existing between the two terms of a motion is
    sometimes taken as existing equidistant from each term, but at other times
    it is not taken in this sense. For a medium that exists between what is
    active and what is passive—if, indeed, it is a medium, as an instrument—is
    sometimes closer to the first active thing, sometimes closer to the last
    passive thing, although it may at other times stand equidistant from each.
    This becomes clear if we consider the action of an agent which finally
    terminates in what is passive by means of several instruments: the medium
    which is the form by which the agent acts is always closer to the agent
    because it is really in the agent, whereas only its likeness is in the
    patient. Now, it is in this manner that the Word is said to be a medium
    between the Father and the creature. Consequently, the Word does not
    necessarily stand equidistant between the Father and the creature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. It is true that we manifest something to another only by means of a word
    that is vocally expressed. Yet one can manifest something to oneself by
    means of the word of the heart; and, since this manifestation takes place
    before the other manifestation, the interior word is said to be the
    Principal word. Similarly, the Father is revealed to all by means of the
    Word Incarnate, but the eternally generated Word has manifested Him to
    Himself. Consequently, the name word does not belong to the Son merely in so
    far as He is incarnate.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. The Incarnate Word in some respects resembles, and, in other respects,
    does not resemble the vocal word. They have this in common as a basis for
    comparison: a vocal word manifests the interior word as flesh manifested the
    eternal Word. They differ, however, in the following respect: the flesh
    assumed by the eternal Word is not said to be a word, whereas the vocal word
    used to manifest an interior word is said to be a word. Consequently, the
    vocal word is something other than the interior word, but the Incarnate Word
    is the same as the eternal Word, just as the word signified by the vocal
    word is the same as the word within the heart.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. The nature of a sign belongs more properly to in effect than to a cause
    when the-cause brings about the existence of the effect but not its meaning,
    as is the case in the example given. But when the effect has derived from
    its cause, not only its existence, but also its meaning, then this cause is
    prior to the effect both in existence and in meaning. Hence, signification
    and manifestation belong more properly to the interior than to the exterior
    word, for whatever meaning the exterior word has been adopted to convey is
    due to the interior word.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. A name is derived from two sources: from the one who uses the word or
    from the thing to which it has been applied. A word is said to be derived
    from a thing in so far as it signifies that by which the notion of the thing
    is completed, that is, the thing’s specific difference; and this is what a
    word principally signifies. But, since we do not know essential differences,
    sometimes, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, we use accidents or effects
    in their place, and name a thing accordingly. Hence, in so far as something
    other than the essential difference of a thing is used as the source of a
    word, the word is said to be derived from the one who uses it. An example of
    this is the word <i>lapis</i> (stone) which is derived from its effect,
    <i>laedere pedem</i> (to bruise the foot). Now, this effect should not be
    taken as that which the word principally signifies, but merely as that which
    takes the place of what is signified. Similarly, <i>verbum</i> (word) is
    derived from <i>verberatio</i> (a disturbing) or from <i>boatus</i> (shout)
    because of those who use it—not because of the thing it signifies.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. As far as the nature of a word is concerned, it makes no difference
    whether a thing is understood by means of a likeness or by means of its
    essence; for it is evident that the exterior word signifies whatever can be
    understood—whether it be understood by means of its essence or by means of a
    likeness. Hence, whatever is understood, whether it has been caused by a
    likeness or by its essence, can be called an interior word.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. Some of the things predicated both of God and creatures exist in God
    before they exist in creatures, even though their names were applied to
    creatures first. These predicates, such as <i>goodness, wisdom,</i> and the
    like, are used of God in their proper sense. Other names signifying other
    things cannot be used of God in their proper sense, but things similar to
    these things can be found in God. These things, therefore, are predicated
    metaphorically of Him, as when we say that God is a lion or that God walks.
    Hence, when the term <i>word is</i> applied to the divine Word from our
    word, this indicates merely the order in the use of the name, not the order
    between the two realities. Consequently, Word is not used metaphorically of
    God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Vocal expression pertains to the nature of a word only with respect to
    that from which the word was taken by the one who employed this noun, not
    with respect to the thing itself. Consequently, even though vocal expression
    is predicated metaphorically of God, it does not follow that a word is in
    Him only metaphorically. For example, Damascene says that the word Θεος
    (God) comes from αθιεν, which means to burn; but, although
    <i>burning is</i> predicated metaphorically of God, <i>God</i> is not.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. The Incarnate Word is compared with the vocal word merely because of a
    certain resemblance, as is clear from what has been said. Hence, the
    Incarnate Word can be said to be a vocal word only metaphorically. But the
    eternal Word is compared with the word of the heart, according to the true
    nature of the interior word. Hence, each is called a word in the proper
    sense.

        It seems that word can also be predicated essentially, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. <i>Word</i> signifies making manifest, as we said in the preceding
        article. Now, of itself the divine essence can manifest itself.
        Consequently, a word of itself belongs to the divine essence, and can be
        predicated of it essentially.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. As we read in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, a word signifies a definition.
        But, according to Augustine, the word is “knowledge with love;” and
        according to Anselm: “When the highest spirit is said to speak, this
        means that He is intuiting by thinking. Now, nothing but essential
        attributes are placed in these definitions. Hence, word is predicated
        essentially.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Whatever is said is a word. But, as Anselm writes, the Father utters
        not only Himself but also the Son and the Holy Spirit. Hence, word is
        common to all three Persons, and, therefore, is predicated essentially.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. As Augustine says, whoever speaks possesses the word he speaks. But,
        as Anselm points out: “Just as the Father knows, and the Son knows, and
        the Holy Spirit knows, and yet there are not three knowers but one, so
        also the Father speaks, and the Son speaks, and the Holy Spirit speaks,
        and yet there are not three speakers but one.” Hence, <i>word</i> can be
        used of any one of them. Now, nothing is common to the three persons but
        the essence. Hence, word is predicated essentially of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. With respect to our intellect, there is no difference between
        speaking and understanding. Now, the divine Word is understood as
        resembling the word in the intellect. Hence, when we say that God
        speaks, we mean simply that He understands. Consequently, His Word is
        simply that which He understands. Now, what God understands is
        predicated of Him essentially. Hence, His Word should be similarly
        predicated.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. As Augustine says,8 the divine Word is the operative power of the
        Father. Now, operative power is predicated essentially of God.
        Therefore, word is also predicated essentially.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. just as love implies an outpouring of affection, so does the word
        imply an outpouring of understanding. But love is predicated essentially
        of God. Hence, so also is the word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. That which can be understood of God without understanding the
        distinction of Persons is not predicated personally. Now, the word
        belongs to this type, for even those who deny the distinction of persons
        admit that God utters Himself. Hence, the word is not predicated of God
        personally.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Augustine says: “Only the Son is called the Word, not the Father and
        the Son taken together.” Now, whatever is predicated essentially belongs
        equally to both. Therefore, the Word is not predicated essentially.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. In the Gospel according to St. John (1:1) we read: “The Word was with
        God.” Since <i>with</i> is a transitive preposition, it implies a
        distinction. Consequently, the Word is distinct from God. But nothing
        that is predicated essentially is distinct in God. Therefore, the Word
        is not predicated essentially.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In God whatever implies a relation of person to person is predicated
        personally, not essentially. But the Word is of this type. Therefore.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. In support of this position, the authority of Richard of St. Victor
        can be cited, since he shows that only the Son is called the Word.

        The word that is predicated metaphorically of God, namely, a creature,
        which is called His word because it manifests Him, undoubtedly pertains
        to the entire Trinity. The object of our present inquiry, however, is
        the word in so far as it is predicated properly of God. Viewed
        superficially, the question seems to be very simple to solve, because
        the Word implies a certain origin according to which the divine Persons
        can be distinguished. Considered more profoundly, however, the question
        is more difficult, since we find in God certain things that imply
        origin, not in reality, but only according to our manner of thinking.
        For example, <i>operation</i> undoubtedly implies something proceeding
        from the one who operates, yet that procession is only according to our
        manner of thinking. Consequently, operation is predicated essentially of
        God, not personally, because God’s power and operations do not differ
        from His essence. Hence, it is not immediately evident whether
        <i>the Word</i> implies a real procession—as <i>son</i> does—or whether
        it implies merely a procession according to our way of thinking—as
        <i>operation</i> does, and so whether the Word is an essential or a
        personal predicate.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For the clarification of this matter, it should be noted that our
        intellectual word, which enables us to speak about the divine Word by a
        kind of resemblance, is that at which our intellectual operation
        terminates. This is the object of understanding, which is called the
        conception of the’intellect—whether the conception can be signified by a
        simple expression, as is true when the intellect forms the quiddities of
        things, or whether it can be signified only by a complex expression, as
        is true when the intellect composes and divides. Now, for us every
        object of understanding really proceeds from something else. For
        example, conceptions of conclusions proceed from principles, conceptions
        of the quiddities of later things proceed from quiddities of things
        prior, or at least an actual conception proceeds from habitual
        knowledge. Now, this is universally true of whatever we understand,
        whether it be understood by its essence or by its likeness; for
        conception itself is an effect of the act of understanding.
        Consequently, when the mind understands itself, its conception is not
        the mind but something expressed by the mind’s act of knowledge. Hence,
        two things pertain to the nature of our intellectual word: it is
        understood, and it is expressed by an agent distinct from itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, if word is predicated of God because of its resemblance to
        both of these characteristics, then the name of word implies a real
        procession—and not merely because of our manner of thinking. On the
        other hand, if it is predicated of God merely because of its resemblance
        to one of these characteristics, namely, that it is understood, then
        word as applied to God does not imply a real procession but one only
        according to our manner of thinking, such as
        <i>the understood</i> implies. This, however, would not be taking word
        in its proper meaning, because it is not taken in its proper meaning if
        something belonging to its nature is entirely left out. Consequently, if
        <i>word</i> is taken in its proper meaning when used of God, it can be
        predicated of Him only personally. However, if it is taken in a broad
        sense, it can also be predicated essentially. Since, however, we should
        use words as most people use them, as the Philosopher says,” usage
        should be followed very carefully when it comes to the meanings of
        words. Moreover, since all the saints commonly use word as a personal
        predication, this is even a stronger reason for saying that it is
        predicated personally.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The nature of a word includes not only the property of making
        something manifest but also a real procession of one thing from another.
        Now, although the divine essence manifests itself, the essence does not
        come from itself in a real procession. Hence, it cannot be called a word
        unless it is called this because it is identical with that Person, as,
        for the same reason, the essence is called the Father or the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The knowledge that is included in the definition of a word should be
        understood as knowledge uttered by another. In us, this is actual
        knowledge. Now, although knowledge or wisdom is predicated essentially
        of God, generated wisdom is predicated only personally. Similarly,
        Anselm’s statement, “ <i>Speak</i> signifies intuiting by thinking,” can
        be understood if <i>speak</i> be taken, in its proper sense, in its
        relation to intellectual intuition. In this sense, we can say that
        something proceeds through speech, namely, <i>the understood.</i>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The intellectual conception is a medium between the intellect and the
        thing known, because through its mediation the intellectual operation
        attains the thing. Hence, the intellectual conception is not only
        <i>that which is</i> understood but also <i>that by which</i> the thing
        is understood. Consequently, that which is understood can be said to be
        both the thing itself as well as an intellectual conception. Similarly,
        that which is spoken interiorly can be said to be both the thing
        expressed by the word and the word itself, as is also true of the
        exterior word, because both the word and the thing the word signifies
        are expressed when the word is spoken. I assert, therefore, that the
        Father is spoken, not as a word, but as a thing spoken by the Word. The
        same is true of the Holy Spirit, because the Son manifests the entire
        Trinity. Consequently, by uttering His own one Word, the Father utters
        all three Persons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Here Anselm seems to contradict himself, for he says that
        <i>Word</i> is predicated only personally and belongs only to the Son,
        while to <i>speak</i> belongs to all three Persons. To speak, however,
        means nothing else but to send forth a word from oneself. Augustine’s
        statement also seems to contradict Anselm’s, for he saysl3that not each
        of the Persons in the Trinity speaks, but only the Father speaks by
        means of His Word. Consequently, just as the Word, properly speaking, is
        predicated only personally of God and belongs only to the Son, so also
        speech belongs only to the Father. Anselm, however, is taking to
        <i>speak</i> in its general meaning of to understand, and <i>word</i> in
        its proper sense. If he wished, he could have taken these words the
        other way around.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. As used of <i>us, speaking</i> signifies not merely understanding but
        understanding plus the expression from within oneself of some
        conception; and we cannot understand in any way other than by forming a
        conception of this sort. Therefore, properly speaking, every act of
        understanding is, in our case, an act of uttering. God, however, can
        understand without something really proceeding from Him, because in Him
        the one understanding, the understood, and intellection itself are all
        identical. This is not true of us, however. Consequently, properly
        speaking, no~ all understanding in God is said to be uttering.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. just as the Word is said to be the Father’s knowledge only in the
        sense that it is knowledge generated by the Father, so also it is called
        the operative power of the Father because it is a power proceeding from
        Him. Now, a power that proceeds is predicated personally, and an
        operative power proceeding from the Father is predicated in this manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. One thing may proceed from another thing in two ways; First, it may
        proceed from it as action proceeds from an agent or as an operation
        proceeds from one operating. Second, it may proceed as a term of an
        operation from one operating. Now, the procession of an operation from
        the one operating does not distinguish a thing that is substantially
        existing from another substantially existing thing; it merely
        distinguishes a perfection from what is perfected, because an operation
        is a perfection of the one operating. On the other hand, the procession
        of the term of an operation distinguishes one thing from another. Now,
        in God the distinction between a perfection and what is perfected cannot
        be a real distinction. There are, however, distinct things in God,
        namely, the three Persons. Hence, a procession signified as existing in
        God as an operation from the one operating is a procession merely
        according to our manner of thinking. But a procession signified as that
        of a thing proceeding from a principle can really be found in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Moreover, there is this difference between the intellect and the will:
        an operation of the will terminates in things, in which good and evil
        are found; but an operation of the intellect terminates in the mind, in
        which the true and the false are found, as is said in the
        <i>Metaphysics.</i> Consequently, the will does not have anything
        proceeding from it except in the manner of an operation. The intellect,
        however, has something in itself that proceeds from it, not only in the
        manner of an operation, but also in the manner of a thing that is the
        term of an operation. Consequently, the word is signified as a thing
        that proceeds, but love, as an operation that proceeds. Hence, love is
        not such as to be predicated personally in the same way in which word
        is.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. If one does not consider the distinction of Persons, he will not say
        that God utters Himself, properly speaking; and those who do not admit
        that there are distinct Persons in God do not understand this uttering
        in its proper sense.

        One could easily answer the objections proposed here if he wished to
        support the opposite opinion.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. To the difficulty drawn from the words of Augustine one could say
        that Augustine understands <i>word</i> in so far as it implies a real
        origin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2.One could reply to this by pointing out that, even if the preposition
        <i>with</i> implies a distinction, this distinction is not implied in
        <i>word.</i> Hence, from the fact that the Word is said to be with the
        Father, one cannot conclude that it is predicated personally, because
        the Word is also said to be “God of God” and “God with God.”

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Basil says: “The Holy Spirit is related to the Son in the same way in
        which the Son is related to the Father; and, for this reason, the Son is
        the word of God, and the Spirit is the word of the Son.”’ Therefore, the
        Holy Spirit can be called a word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. In the Epistle to the Hebrews (1:3) the following is said of the Son:
        “Who being the brightness of his glory, and the figure of his substance,
        and upholding all things by the word of his power...” Hence, the Son has
        a word proceeding from Himself by which He upholds all things. But in
        God no one proceeds from the Son except the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the
        Holy Spirit can be called the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. As Augustine says: “The Word is loving knowledge.” But, just as
        knowledge is appropriated to the Son, so love is appropriated to the
        Holy Spirit. Consequently, the Word is a proper name for the Holy Spirit
        as well as for the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The Gloss on “upholding all things by the word of his power” (Hebrews
        1:3) says that <i>word</i> should be taken as meaning a
        <i>command.</i> But a command is classified as a sign of the will.
        Therefore, since the Holy Spirit proceeds from the will, it seems that
        He can be called Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The notion of word implies a making manifest. Now, the Holy Spirit
        manifests the Father and the Son, just as the Son manifests the Father;
        for, as we read in the Gospel of St. John (16:13): “the Holy Spirit
        teaches all truth.” Therefore, the Holy Spirit should be called Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Augustine says: “The Son is called Word for the same reason that He is
        called Son.” Now, the Son is called Son because He is generated.
        Therefore, He is called Word, also, because He is generated. The Holy
        Spirit, however, is not generated; hence, He is not a word.

        <i>Word</i> and image are used differently by us and our holy men than
        they were used by the ancient Greek doctors, who used these names to
        signify everything that proceeds from the Godhead, and indifferently
        called the Son and the Holy Spirit Word and Image. Our saints” and
        ourselves, however, have followed the custom of canonical Scripture in
        the use of these words; and Scripture seldom if ever uses Word or Image
        for any one except the Son. We are not now concerned with image, but
        that our use of <i>word</i> is reasonable enough will appear from. the
        following.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <i>Word</i> implies a making manifest, and manifestation is found
        essentially only in the intellect. If something outside the intellect is
        said to “manifest” this is true only to the extent that something of it
        remains in the intellect. Hence, what proximately manifests is within
        the intellect, even though what remotely manifests can be outside of it.
        Consequently, <i>word</i> is used properly of that which proceeds from
        the intellect. Of that which does not proceed from the intellect it can
        be used only metaphorically; that is, it can be used of such a thing
        only in so far as it manifests in some way or other. I say, therefore,
        that in God only the Son proceeds from the intellect, because He
        proceeds from one Person; the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from two
        Persons, proceeds from the will. Consequently, the Holy Spirit can be
        called Word only metaphorically, that is, only in so far as whatever
        manifests can be called a word. The quotation from Basil should be
        understood in this sense.

        1. The reply is clear from our discussion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. According to Basil’s the “word” referred to in this passage is the
        Holy Spirit. If this is true, our reply is the same as we gave to the
        first difficulty. Or, if we follow the Gloss, the “word” referred to is
        the command of the Son. This is called the word metaphorically, since we
        ordinarily command by means of a word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Knowledge belongs to the notion of word since it implies, as it were,
        the very essence of word; but love belongs to the notion of word, not as
        something pertaining to its essence, but as something that accompanies a
        word. The passage cited shows this. Hence, one cannot conclude that the
        Holy Spirit is a word, but, rather, that He proceeds from the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. A word manifests not only what is in the intellect but also what is
        in the will, in so far as the will itself is also understood. Hence,
        even though a command is a sign of the will, it can be called a word and
        it pertains to the intellect.

        It seems not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. When we say that the Father utters Himself, all that is signified is
        one uttering and something uttered, and the Father alone is signified by
        both. Now, since the Father does not produce the Word from Himself
        except as He utters Himself, it seems that creatures are not uttered by
        the Word which proceeds from the Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The word by which each thing is expressed is its likeness. “The Word
        cannot be called a likeness of creatures,” as Anselm proves,’ because
        either it would resemble creatures perfectly—and then it would be
        changeable and without its sublime immutability—or it would not resemble
        them perfectly—and then it would lose its sublime truth, because the
        truth of a likeness is in direct proportion to its conformity with that
        whose likeness it is. Hence, the Son is not the Word by which creatures
        are uttered.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The word of creatures is said to be in God as the word of his
        products is in a craftsman. Now, the word of his products in a craftsman
        is merely the plan he has with respect to them. Therefore, the word of
        creatures in God is merely the plan He has made with respect to
        creatures. But God’s plans for His creatures are predicated of the
        essence, not of a person. Hence, the word by which creatures are uttered
        is not the Word that is a personal predicate.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Every word is related as an archetype or image to that which is
        uttered by it. When a word causes a thing, as happens in the practical
        intellect, then that word is an archetype. When, however, a thing causes
        a word, as happens in our speculative intellect, then that word is an
        image. Now, in God there cannot be the word of a creature that is the
        image of a creature. Hence, the word of creatures that is in God must be
        an archetype of creatures. But the divine archetype of creatures is an
        idea. Therefore, the divine word of creatures is simply an idea. An
        idea, however, is predicated of God, not personally, but essentially.
        Consequently, the Word which is predicated personally of God, and by
        which the Father utters Himself, is not the word by which creatures are
        uttered.-
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The distance separating creatures from God is greater than that which
        separates them from other creatures. Now, in God there are many ideas of
        different creatures; hence, the Father does not utter Himself and
        creatures in the same word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. According to Augustine: “The Son is called the Word for the same
        reason that He is called an image. Now, the Son is not an image of
        creatures but only of the Father. Hence, He is not the word of
        creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Every word proceeds from that whose word it is. But the Son does not
        proceed from creatures. Hence, He is not the word by which creatures are
        uttered.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Anselm says that by uttering Himself the Father uttered all
        creatures. But the Word by which He uttered Himself is the Son.
        Therefore, by the Word, which is the Son, the Father utters all
        creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Augustine explains the expression, “He spoke and it was made,” as
        meaning: “He begot the Word in which all things were in order to come
        into existence.” Therefore, by the Word which is the Son the Father
        uttered all creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. By the same act, the artist is turned toward his art and his work.
        But God Himself is the eternal art from which creatures are produced
        like works of art. Therefore, in the same act, the Father is turned
        toward Himself and to all creatures. Hence, by uttering Himself, He
        utters all creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4'- Whatever is subsequent is reduced to what is first in that class as
        to its cause. Now, creatures are uttered by God. Therefore, they are
        reduced to the first which God utters. But God first utters Himself.
        Hence, by the fact that He utters Himself, He utters all creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The Son proceeds from the Father in the manner of nature inasmuch as He
        proceeds as a Son, and in the manner of intellect inasmuch as He
        proceeds as the Word. We find both types of processions in ourselves,
        although not in the same respect. For in our case nothing proceeds from
        something else both in the manner of nature and in the manner of
        intellect, because with us the act of understanding and the act of
        existing are not the same—which they are in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Moreover, in both types of procession the difference between procession
        from God and procession from us is similar. For a human son, proceeding
        in the manner of nature from a human father, receives only a part of his
        father’s substance, not all of it; but the Son of God, proceeding in the
        manner of nature from the Father, receives all of His Father’s nature in
        such a way that both the Father and the Son have absolutely one and the
        same numerical nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This difference is also found with respect to the intellectual
        processions. The word expressed in us by actual consideration and
        arising, as it were, from a consideration of a thing known previously,
        or at least from habitual knowledge, does not receive into itself the
        whole of that from which it had its origin. For, in the conception of
        one word, the intellect expresses not all but only part of what it
        possesses in its habitual knowledge. Similarly, what is contained in one
        conclusion does not express all that was contained virtually in its
        principle. However, for the divine Word to be perfect, it must express
        whatever is contained in that from which it had its origin, especially
        since God sees all things, not in many intuitions, but in one.
        Consequently, whatever is contained in the Father’s knowledge is
        necessarily and entirely expressed by His only Word and in the very same
        manner in which all things are contained in His knowledge. In this way
        it is a true word, whose intellectual content corresponds to that of its
        principle. Through His knowledge, moreover, the Father knows Himself,
        and, by knowing Himself, He knows all other things. Hence, His Word
        chiefly expresses the Father and, as a result, all other things which
        the Father knows by knowing Himself. Therefore, because the Son is a
        word that perfectly expresses the Father, the Son expresses all
        creatures. This sequence is outlined by the words of Anselm, who said’
        that by uttering Himself the Father uttered all creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. When we say that the Father utters Himself we signify that in this
        utterance every creature is included, since the Father’s knowledge
        contains all creatures, being, as it were, their archetype.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Anselm is taking <i>likeness</i> in its strict sense, as Dionysius
        does when he says that, when things are ordered equally to each other,
        we receive a mutual likeness; that is, one thing can be said to be
        similar to the other and the other similar to it. But, properly
        speaking, no such mutual likeness is found between a cause and its
        effect. We say that a picture of Hercules resembles Hercules, but not
        that Hercules resembles the picture. Hence, since the divine Word is
        not, like our word, made in the likeness of a creature, but rather the
        opposite is true, Anselm means to say simply that the Word is not a
        likeness of creatures but creatures are a likeness of the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, if <i>likeness</i> is taken in its broader meaning, then we can
        say that the Word is a likeness of creatures, not, however, in the sense
        that it is an image of creatures, but in the sense that it is their
        archetype. Taking the term in this meaning, Augustine calls ideas
        likenesses of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Finally, it does not follow that the highest truth is not in the Word
        merely from the fact that the Word remains unchanged while existing
        creatures change; for the truth of a word does not demand that it be a
        likeness with the same nature as that of the thing declared by the word;
        it is enough if it is a true representation of the thing, as we have
        pointed out previously.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The divine plan for creatures is called a word, properly speaking,
        only if this plan proceeds from another—and is therefore a begotten
        plan. This, however, like begotten wisdom, is a personal predication.
        Taken simply, the divine plan is an essential predication.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. A word differs from an idea, for the latter means an exemplary cause
        and nothing else, but the word in God of a creature means an exemplary
        form that is drawn from something else. Hence, a divine idea pertains to
        the essence, but a word, to a person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Even though the greatest possible distance separates God from a
        creature because of what is proper to each, God is the model in whose
        likeness creatures are created. There is no creature that is a model for
        another creature. Hence, in that Word by which God is expressed every
        creature is expressed; but the idea by which one creature is expressed
        does not express another. Thus, this is another difference between the
        Word and an idea. The reason for this is that an idea is directly
        related to a creature; hence, for many creatures there are many ideas.
        On the other hand, the Word is directly related to God, whom the Word
        expresses first, and then, as a consequence, expresses creatures.
        Because all creatures are one as they exist in God there is only one
        Word for all of them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. When Augustine says that the Son “is called a Word for the same
        reason that He is called an Image,” he is referring to the
        distinguishing personal characteristic of the Son, which remains the
        same whether He is called, because of it, the Son, the Word, or the
        Image of the Father. But in the manner of signifying, these three
        predicates are not of the same type, for <i>word</i> implies not only
        the notion of origin and imitation but also that of manifestation.
        Consequently, the Word is, in a fashion, the word of creatures, because
        creatures are manifested by means of the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. A word can belong to something in different ways. First, it can
        belong to one who is speaking. Taken in this sense, it proceeds from him
        whose word it is. Second, it can belong to that which is made manifest
        by the word. In this sense, the word does not necessarily proceed from
        that whose word it is, unless the knowledge from which the word proceeds
        has been caused by things. However, this is not true of God’s knowledge.
        Hence, the conclusion does not follow.

        It seems not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Every name that implies a relation to creatures is predicated of God
        only from the beginning of time, for example, <i>Creator</i> and
        <i>Lord.</i> But Word is predicated of God from all eternity. Therefore,
        it does not imply a relation to creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. All relatives are relative in being or in predication. Now, the Word
        is not related to creatures in being, because then it would depend on
        creatures. Nor is it related to them merely in predication, because then
        it would have to be related to creatures in one of the grammatical
        cases. And since in this type of relation one thing is usually referred
        to another by means of the genitive case, we would have to say: “The
        Word is of creatures.” This statement, however, Anselm denies.’
        Therefore, the Word does not imply any relation to creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Any name implying a relation to creatures cannot be understood unless
        the actual or potential existence of creatures is also understood,
        because, if one understands one of two relatives, he also understands
        the other. But, even if some creature is not understood as existing now
        or in the future, the divine Word, by which the Father utters Himself,
        is understood. Therefore, the Word does not imply any relation to
        creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The relation of God to creatures can be only that of a cause to an
        effect. But, as Dionysius says, any name that implies an effect in
        creatures is common to the entire Trinity. However, <i>Word</i> is not
        this kind of a name. Hence, it does not imply any relation to creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. God is not understood as having a relation to creatures unless it be
        by His wisdom, goodness, and power. But these attributes are predicated
        of the Word merely by appropriation; and since <i>Word</i> is not merely
        an appropriated but a proper name, it seems that <i>Word</i> does not
        imply a relation to creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Even though man arranges things, the word man does not imply a
        relation to the things he has arranged. Therefore, even though all
        things are arranged by the Word, <i>Word</i> does not imply a relation
        to them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Like son, word is a relative predication. Now, the entire relation of
        the son terminates in the father, for he is not the son of any one but
        the father. Therefore, the entire relation of the Word terminates
        similarly. Hence, <i>Word</i> does not imply a relation to creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <i>8.</i> According to the Philosopher, every relative is said to be
        such only with relation to one other thing. Otherwise, the relative
        would have two essences, since the essence of a relative lies simply in
        its being related to another. Now, the Word is predicated as relative to
        the Father; therefore, it is not predicated as relative to creatures.

        9. If the same word is applied to specifically different things, it is
        used of them equivocally, as <i>dog is</i> used of hounds and fish. Now,
        superiority and inferiority are specifically different types of
        relations. If, therefore, one word implies both relations, then that
        word is used equivocally. But the relation of the Word to creatures is
        simply one of superiority, and the relation of the Word to the Father
        is, in a way, one of inferiority—not because of any unequal dignity, but
        because of the authority which a principle has. Hence, the Word which
        implies a relation to the Father does not imply a relation to creatures,
        unless it is taken equivocally.

        The Word is called <i>Logos</i> in Greek, and in Latin it means an
        intelligible character and word. In this passage, however,
        <i>word</i> is better interpreted as meaning a relation, not only to the
        Father, but also to those things which are made by His power, acting
        through the Word. This statement clearly supports our position.

        2. Explaining the words of the Psalmist, “God hath spoken once” (Psalms
        61:12), the Gloss says: “‘Once, that is, God has eternally begotten the
        Word in which He disposes all things.” Now, disposition implies a
        relation to the things disposed. Therefore, Word is predicated
        relatively.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Every word implies a relation to what is signified by it. But, as
        Anselm says, by uttering Himself God utters all creatures. Therefore,
        the Word implies a relation, not only to the Father, but also to
        creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. From the very fact of His being the Son, the Son perfectly represents
        the Father in that which is intrinsic to the Father. Now, the Word, by
        its very name, adds the notion of making manifest. But there can be no
        manifestation other than that in which the Father is manifested through
        creatures—a manifestation, as it were, to the exterior. Therefore, the
        Word implies a relation to creatures.

        5. Dionysius says that God is praised as being a word or principle of
        intelligibility because “He is the giver of wisdom and reason.” From
        this it is clear that the Word as predicated of God implies the notion
        of cause. Now, a cause is predicated relatively to its effect.
        Therefore, the Word implies a relation to creatures.

        6. The practical intellect is related to the things carried out through
        its instrumentality. Now, the divine Word is the word of an intellect

        word. Therefore, it implies a relation to creatures.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Whenever two things are related to each other in such a way that one
        depends upon the other but the other does not depend upon it, there is a
        real relation in the dependent member, but in the independent member the
        relation is merely one of reason—simply because one thing cannot be
        understood as being related to another without that other being
        understood as being related to it. The notion of such a relation becomes
        clear if we consider knowledge, which depends on what is known, although
        the latter does not depend on it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consequently, since all creatures depend on God but He does not depend
        on them, there are real relations in creatures, referring them to God.
        The opposite relations in God to creatures, however, are merely
        conceptual relations; but, because names are signs of concepts, certain
        names we use for God imply a relation to creatures, even though, as we
        have said, this relation is merely conceptual. The only real relations
        in God are those by which the divine persons are distinguished from each
        other.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Among relative terms, we find that some are used to signify the
        relations themselves, for example, the word <i>likeness.</i> Others are
        used to signify something upon which a relation follows. For example,
        <i>knowledge is</i> used to signify a certain quality upon which a
        particular relation follows. We find this difference also in the
        relative names used of God, both in the names used of Him as from all
        eternity, as well as in those used of Him as from the beginning of time.
        For <i>Father is</i> used of Him as from all eternity, and
        <i>Lord</i> as from the beginning of time; and each of these words is
        used to signify the relations themselves. But <i>Creator,</i> used of
        God as from the beginning of time, is employed to signify a divine
        action upon which a certain relation follows. The same is true of
        <i>Word;</i> it is used to signify something absolute to which something
        relative is joined; for, as Augustine says, the Word is simply “begotten
        Wisdom.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This, however, does not prevent Word from being a personal predication,
        because God begetting or God begotten is, like Father, predicated
        personally. It may happen, however, that an absolute thing is able to
        have a relation to many other things. This is why a name that is used to
        signify something absolute upon which a relation follows can be spoken
        of as being relative to many things, and it is in this manner that
        <i>knowledge</i> is used. Inasmuch as it is knowledge, it is relative to
        what is known, but inasmuch as it is a particular accident or form, it
        is related to the knower. In the same way, word is related to the one
        who utters it and to that which is uttered by the word. In the latter
        relation, it can be taken in two ways: first, according as the two are
        interchangeable, and in this sense we speak of a word as being related
        to what is spoken; second, according as the word is related to a thing
        to which the character of being uttered belongs. And since the Father
        principally utters Himself by begetting His Word, and, as a consequence
        of this, utters creatures, the Word is principally, and, as it were,
        essentially referred to the Father, but consequently, and, as it were,
        accidentally, to creatures; for it is only accidental to the Word that
        creatures are uttered through it.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. That argument is true of those names which imply an actual relation
        to creatures, but not of those which imply a habitual relation. A
        habitual relation is one that does not require the actual existence of a
        creature. All the relations that follow upon an act of the soul are of
        this kind, because the will and the intellect can be related to a thing
        that does not actually exist. Now, the Word implies an intellectual
        procession. Hence, the argument proves nothing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The Word is spoken of as being related to creatures, but this is not
        a real relation in the sense that this relation to creatures really
        exists in God. It is rather a relation merely according to predication.
        Moreover, there is no reason why this relation should not be expressed
        by some grammatical case; for I can say that He is the Word of creatures
        in the sense that the Word is about creatures, although not from them.
        It is this last sense that Anselm denies. Besides, even if the Word were
        not referred to creatures by means of some grammatical case, it would be
        enough if it is referred to them in any manner whatsoever; for example,
        if it were referred to them by a preposition joined with some case. Then
        one would say that the Word “is for creatures,” that is, for
        constituting them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That argument holds for those names whose notions imply a relation to
        creatures. But this name is not that type, as is evident from our
        discussion in the body of the article. Hence, the conclusion does not
        follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Inasmuch as <i>Word</i> implies something absolute, it expresses a
        relation of causality over creatures; but inasmuch as it implies a
        relation of real origin, it is a personal name; and under this aspect it
        expresses no relation to creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. From our last answer, the answer to the fifth difficulty is evident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The Word is not merely that by which the arrangement of all creatures
        takes place; it is the arrangement itself which the Father makes of
        things to be created. Hence, in some way, the Word is related to
        creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The name <i>son</i> implies a relation only to that principle from
        which He comes, but <i>word</i> implies a relation both to the principle
        by which the Word was uttered and to that which is, as it were, its
        term, namely, that which is manifested through the word. What is
        manifested, of course, is principally the Father; but also, and, as a
        consequence, creatures are manifested, which, however, can in no way be
        a principle of a divine Person. Hence, Son implies no relation at all to
        creatures, such as <i>Word</i> does.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. That argument is based on those names used to signify relations
        themselves, for it is impossible for one relation to terminate in many
        things, unless these are in some way one.

        The arguments supporting the opposite opinion conclude that the Word is

        essentially or, as it were, principally. In this limited sense, they
        must be granted.

        It seems that things do not exist more truly in the Word, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. A thing exists more truly where it exists through its essence than
        where it exists only through its likeness. But things exist in the Word
        only through their likeness, and in themselves through their essence.
        Therefore, they exist more truly in themselves than in the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. But it was said that they exist more nobly in the Word because in the
        Word they have a more noble act of existence.—On the contrary, as
        Augustine says,’ a material thing has a more noble act of existence in
        our soul than it has in itself, yet it exists more truly in itself than
        it does in our soul. For the same reason, a thing exists more truly in
        itself than it does in the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. What exists actually exists more truly than what exists potentially.
        But a thing existing in itself is in act; in the Word, however, it
        exists only potentially, like a product existing in a craftsman.
        Therefore, a thing exists more truly in itself than it does in the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The ultimate perfection of a thing is its operation. Now, things
        existing in themselves have their own operations—which they do not have
        as they exist in the Word. Therefore, they exist more truly in
        themselves than in the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Only things of one character can be compared. Now, the act of
        existence which a thing in itself has is not of the same character as
        that which it has in the Word. Therefore, at least one cannot say that a
        thing exists more truly in the Word than in itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As Anselm. says, a creature as it exists in the Creator is a creative
        essence. But an uncreated act of existence exists more truly than the
        created act. Therefore, a thing has existence in the Word more truly
        than it has in itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. We assert that there are ideas in the divine mind, just as Plato
        asserted that the ideas of things exist outside of it. Now, according to
        Plato, the “separated man” was more truly man than the material man;
        hence, he called the separated man “man in himself.” For this reason,
        and, indeed, because of the position of the Faith, things exist more
        truly in the Word than in themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That which is truest in any class is the measure for the entire
        class. But the likenesses of things existing in the Word are the
        measures of the truth of all things, because a thing is said to be true
        in so far as it imitates that upon which it was modeled, and this
        archetype exists in the Word. Therefore, things exist more truly in the
        Word than in themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As Dionysius says effects fall short of perfectly imitating their causes
        which are above them, and, because of this distance between the cause
        and the effect, something is truly predicated of the effect that is not
        predicated of the cause. For example, amusements are not properly said
        to be amused, although they are causes of our being amused. Now, this
        certainly could not happen unless the manner of the causes’ existence
        were more sublime than the things predicated of their effects. And we
        find this to be true of all equivocal efficient causes. For example, the
        sun cannot be said to be hot, even though other things an heated by it;
        and this is because of the superiority of the sun over those things that
        are called hot.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        When, therefore, we ask if things exist more truly in themselves than in
        the Word we must make a distinction, because more truly can refer to the
        truth of the thing or to the truth of the predication. If it refers to
        the truth of the thing, then undoubtedly the truth of things as they
        exist in the Word is greater than that which they possess in themselves.
        But, if it refers to the truth of predication, then the opposite is
        true. For man is more truly predicated of a thing which is in its own
        nature than it is of a thing as it is in the Word. But this is not due
        to any defect in the Word, but, rather, to its great superiority, as was
        pointed out.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. If one is thinking of truth of predication, then, simply speaking, it
        is true that a thing exists more truly where it exists through its
        essence than where it exists through a likeness. But if one considers
        the truth of the thing, then a thing exists more truly where it exists
        through a likeness which is its cause than where it exists through a
        likeness which it has caused.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The likeness of a thing in our soul is not the cause of that thing,
        as is the likeness existing in the Word. Hence, there is no parallel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. An active potency is more perfect than an act which is its effect. It
        is According to this kind of potency that creatures are said to exist
        potentially in the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Although creatures as they are in the Word do not have their own
        operations, nevertheless, they have more noble operations inasmuch as
        they cause things as well as the operations of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Although the act of existence of creatures in the Word and their act
        of existing in themselves are not of the same character univocally, they
        are of the same character analogously.

        1. This argument proceeds from the truth of the thing, not from the
        truth of predication.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Plato was criticized for asserting that natural forms exist in their
        own natures, without matter—as though matter were merely accidentally
        related to natural species. If this were true, “natural things” could be
        truly predicated of things without matter. Our position, however, is not
        the same as Plato’s. Hence, there is no parallel.

        divine intellect knows also those things which are not, will not be, and
        never have been. This we showed when we treated God’s knowledge.’ Hence,
        the Word can be related to these things.

        2. According to Augustine: “The Son is the Father’s art, filled with the
        ideas of living things.” But, as Augustine says elsewhere: “Even if
        nothing comes into being because of an idea, it is rightly called an
        idea.” Hence, the Word is also related to those things which will not be
        or have not been made.

        3. The Word would not be perfect unless it contained in itself all that
        is contained in the knowledge of Him who utters it. But the knowledge of
        the Father, who utters the Word, includes those things which never will
        be and never were. Therefore, these things also are contained in the
        Word.

        A thing can be in the Word in two ways. First, it can be in the Word as
        what the Word knows, or what can be known in the Word. It is in this
        latter way that those things exist in the Word that do not exist, have
        not existed, and will not exist; for the Word knows these things just as
        the Father does, and they can be known in the Word just as they can be
        known in the Father. Second, a thing is said to be in the Word as
        something spoken through the Word. Now, whatever is spoken by a word is
        in some way directed to be carried out, because it is by means of words
        that we incite others to action and arrange for them to carry out our
        ideas. This is why God’s utterance is called His arrangement, as the
        Gloss says, commenting on the words of the Psalmist (Psalms 61:12): “God
        hath spoken once...” Hence, just as God does not dispose things unless
        they are, will be, or have been, so also He does not utter such things.
        Consequently, the Word is related to these things only, namely, the
        things that are actually uttered. But knowledge, art, and idea (in other
        words, intelligible representation) do not imply a relation to
        execution. Hence, no parallel exists between them and the Word.

        1. The Word causes things in so far as they exist in it. Therefore, if
        the things within the Word are life, the Word causes them through its
        life. Now, from the fact that the Word causes things through its
        goodness, all things are good. Hence, if it causes things through its
        life, all things would be living. This is false, and, consequently, the
        initial proposition is false.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Things exist in the Word as works exist in an artist. But as they are
        in an artist works are not life. They are not the life of the artist,
        who lived even before they existed in him, nor do they have any life
        themselves, for they are lifeless. Therefore, creatures in the Word are
        not life, either.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In Scripture, the causing of life is appropriated to the Holy Spirit
        rather than to the Word. This is clear from John (6:64): “It is the
        spirit that quickeneth,” as well as from other passages. Now, as is
        clear from what we said previously, only the Son, and not the Holy
        Spirit, is called the Word. Consequently, it is not consistent to say
        that things existing in the Word are life.

        4. Intellectual light is not the principle of life. But things in the
        Word are light. Hence, it seems that in the Word they are not life.

        2. According to the Philosopher, the motion of the heavens is said to be
        “a kind of life for all naturally existing things.” But the Word has a
        greater influence on creatures than the motion of the heavens has on
        nature. Therefore, as they exist in the Word, things should be called
        life.

        As they exist in the Word, things can be considered in two ways: in
        their relation to the Word and in their relation to things exist in
        their own natures. In both ways, the likeness of a creature in the Word
        is life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, we say that something lives in the proper sense if it has a
        principle of motion or of any activity whatsoever within it, for the
        primary reason why things are said to be alive is that they seem to have
        something within them moving them in some kind of motion. For this
        reason the word <i>life</i> is used of all things which have in them the
        principle of their own activity. Consequently, because certain things
        understand, feel, or will, they are said to be living—not merely because
        they move from place to place or because they increase in quantity.
        Hence, that act of existence which a thing has in so far as it moves
        itself to perform a certain action is properly called the life of the
        thing, because “the life of a living being is its act of existence,” as
        is said in <i>The Soul</i>. In our case, however, no action that we move
        ourselves to perform is our act of existence. Hence, properly speaking,
        to understand is not our life, unless to <i>live</i> is taken to mean
        the end-term of an operation; but this is merely a sign of life.
        Similarly, a likeness as conceived within us is not our life. On the
        other hand, he intellection of the Word is His act of existence, and so
        is the likeness of things He possesses. Therefore, a likeness of a
        creature existing in the Word is also His life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Similarly, this likeness of the creature is, in a way, the creature
        itself—that is, in the same way that the soul is said to be, in some
        fashion, all things. Consequently, because the likeness of a creature
        existing within the Word in some way produces the creature and moves it
        as it exists in its own nature, the creature, in a sense, moves itself,
        and brings itself into being; that is, in view of the fact that it is
        brought into being, and is moved by its likeness existing in the Word.
        Thus the likeness of a creature in the Word is, in a certain sense, the
        very life of the creature itself.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. That a creature existing in the Word is called life does not pertain
        to the creature’s own nature, but to its manner of existence in the
        Word. Since it does not exist in this manner in itself, it does not
        follow that it fives in itself, even though it is life in the Word—any
        more than it follows that the thing is immaterial in itself because it
        is immaterial in the Word. On the other hand, goodness, being, and other
        things of this sort belong to the creature’s own nature. Hence, just as
        creatures good when existing in the Word, so also are they good when
        existing in their own nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The likeness of things in an artist cannot be called life in the
        strict sense, because they are neither the very act of existence of the
        living artist nor the artist’s operation, as is true of God. It is true,
        however, as Augustine says, that “a cabinet existing in the mind of a
        cabinetmaker is living;” but this is because as it exists in his mind it
        possesses an intelligible act of existence, which belongs to the
        category of life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Life is attributed to the Holy Spirit according as God is said to be
        the life of things, namely, as He is in all things and moves all things,
        with the result that all things seem to be moved, in some way, by an
        intrinsic principle. But life is appropriated to the Word according as
        things are in God. This is clear from what has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. just as the likenesses of things in the Word cause existence in
        things, so also they cause knowledge in things—that is, in so far as
        they are received into intelligences, thus causing them to be able to
        know things. Hence, just as these likenesses are called life because
        they are principles of existing, so are they also called light because
        they are principles of knowing.
