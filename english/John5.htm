        1 After this there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to
        Jerusalem. 2 Now at Jerusalem there is a Sheep Pool, called in Hebrew
        Bethsaida, having five porticoes. 3 In these porticoes lay a great
        number of people: feeble, blind, lame and withered, waiting for the
        movement of the water. 4 From time to time an angel of the Lord used to
        come down into the pool and the water was stirred up, and the first one
        into the pool after it was stirred was healed of whatever ailment he
        had. 5 There was one man lying there who had been sick for thirty-eight
        years with his infirmity. 6 Jesus, seeing him lying there and knowing
        that he had been sick a long time, said to him, “Do you wish to be
        healed?” 7 The sick man said, “Sir, I have no one to plunge me into the
        pool once the water is stirred up. By the time I get there, someone else
        has gone in before me.” 8 Jesus said to him, “Stand up, pick up your mat
        and walk!” 9a The man was immediately cured; he picked up his mat, and
        walked.

      699 Above, our Lord dealt with spiritual rebirth; here he deals with the
      benefits God gives to those who are spiritually reborn. Now we see that
      parents give three things to those who are physically born from them:
      life, nourishment, and instruction or discipline. And those who are
      spiritually reborn receive these three from Christ: spiritual life,
      spiritual nourishment, and spiritual teaching. And so these three things
      are considered here: first, the giving of spiritual life; secondly, the
      giving of spiritual food (c 6); and thirdly, spiritual teaching (c 7).
    </p>
    <p>
      About the first he does three things. First, he sets forth a visible sign
      in which he shows Christ’s power to produce and to restore life. This is
      the usual practice in this Gospel: to always join to the teaching of
      Christ some appropriate visible action, so that what is invisible can be
      made known through the visible. Secondly, the occasion for this teaching
      is given (v 9b). Thirdly, the teaching itself is given (v 19). As to the
      first he does three things. First, the place of the miracle is given.
      Secondly, the illness involved. Thirdly, the restoration of the sick
      person to health (v 8).
    </p>
    <p>
      700 The place of this miracle is described in two ways: in general and in
      particular. The general place is Jerusalem; so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">After this,</span> i.e., after the miracle
      performed in Galilee,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">there was a Jewish festival,</span> that
      is Pentecost, according to Chrysostom. For above, when Christ went to
      Jerusalem, it was the Passover that was mentioned; and now, on the
      following festival of Pentecost,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Jesus went up to Jerusalem</span> again.
      For as we read in Exodus (23:17), the Lord commanded that all Jewish males
      be presented in the temple three times a year: on the festival days of the
      Passover, Pentecost, and the Dedication.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two reasons why our Lord went up to Jerusalem for these
      festivals. First, so that he would not seem to oppose the law, for he said
      himself: “I have not come to destroy the law, but to complete it” (Mt
      5:17); and in order to draw the many people gathered there on the feast
      days to God by his signs and teaching: “I will praise him in the midst of
      the people” (Ps 108:30); and again, “I have declared your justice in the
      great assembly” (Ps 39:10). So Christ himself says, as we read below
      (18:20): “1 have spoken openly to the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      701 The specific place of the miracle was the pool called the Sheep Pool;
      so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Now at Jerusalem there is a Sheep Pool.</span
      >
      This is described here in four ways: by its name, its structure, from its
      occupants, and from its power.
    </p>
    <p>
      702 First, it is described from its name when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">there is a Sheep Pool</span> (<i
        >probatica piscina</i
      >), for <i>probaton</i> is Greek for “sheep.” It was called the Sheep Pool
      for it was there that the priests washed the sacrificial animals;
      especially the sheep, who were used more than the other animals. And so in
      Hebrew it was called
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Bethsaida,</span> that is, the “house of
      sheep.” This pool was located near the temple, and formed from collected
      rain water.
    </p>
    <p>
      703 In its mystical sense, this pool, according to Chrysostom, has
      prefigured Baptism. For the Lord, wishing to prefigure the grace of
      baptsim in different ways, first of all chose water: for this washes the
      body from the uncleanness which came from contact with what was legally
      unclean (Nm 19). Secondly, he gave this pool a power that expresses even
      more vividly than water the power of Baptism: for it not only cleansed the
      body from its uncleanness, but also healed it from its illness; for
      symbols are more expressive, the closer they approach the reality. Thus it
      signified the power of Baptism: for as this water when applied to the body
      had the power (not by its own nature, but from an angel) to heal its
      illness, so the water of Baptism has the power to heal and cleanse the
      soul from sins: “He loved us, and washed us from our sins” (Rv 1:5). This
      is the reason why the passion of Christ, prefigured by the sacrifices of
      the Old Law, is represented in Baptism: “All of us who have been baptized
      into Christ Jesus, have been baptized into his death” (Rom 6:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Augustine, the water in this pool signified the condition of
      the Jewish people, according to: “The waters are the peoples” (Rv 17:15).
      The Gentiles were not confined within the limits of the divine law, but
      each of them lived according to the vanity of his heart (Eph 4:17). But
      the Jews were confined under the worship of the one God: “We were kept
      under the law, confined, until the faith was revealed” (Gal 3:23). So this
      water, confined to the pool, signified the Jewish people. And it was
      called the Sheep Pool, for the Jews were the special sheep of God: “We are
      his people, his sheep” (Ps 94:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      704 The pool is described in its structure as
      <span style="font-weight: bold">having five porticoes,</span> i.e., round
      about, so that a number of the priests could stand and wash the animals
      without inconvenience. In the mystical sense these five porticoes,
      according to Chrysostom, signify the five wounds in the body of Christ;
      about which we read: “Put your hand into my side, and do not be
      unbelieving, but believe” (below 20:27). But according to Augustine, these
      five porticoes signify the five books of Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      705 The pool is also described from its occupants, for
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >in these porticoes lay a great number of people: feeble, blind, lame
        and withered.</span
      >
      The literal explanation of this is that since all the afflicted persons
      gathered because of the curative power of the water, which did not always
      cure nor cure many at the same time, it was inevitable that there be many
      hanging around waiting to be cured. The mystical meaning of this, for
      Augustine, was that the law was incapable of healing sins: “It is
      impossible that sins be taken away by the blood of bulls and goats” (Heb
      10:4). The law merely shed light on them, for “The knowledge of sin comes
      from the law” (Rom 3:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      706 And so, subject to various illnesses, these people lay there, unable
      to be cured. They are described in four ways. First, by their posture: for
      there they lay, i.e., clinging to earthly things by their sins; for one
      who is lying down is in direct contact with the earth: “He had compassion
      on them, for they were suffering, and lying like sheep without a shepherd”
      (Mt 9:36). But the just do not lie down, but stand upright, toward the
      things of heaven: “They,” i.e., sinners, “are bound, and have fallen down;
      but we,” the just, “have stood and are erect” (Ps 19:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, they are described as to their number, for there was a
      <span style="font-weight: bold">great number</span> of them: “The evil are
      hard to correct, and the iiurnber of fools is infinite” (Ecc 1:15); and in
      Matthew (7:13): “The road that leads to destruction is wide, and many go
      this way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, these sick people are described as to their condition. And he
      mentions four things which a person brings on himself through sin. First,
      a person who is ruled by sinful passions is made listless or feeble: and
      so he says, <span style="font-weight: bold">feeble</span>. So it is that
      Cicero calls certain passions of the soul, such as anger and concupiscence
      and the like, illnesses of the soul. And the Psalm says: “Have mercy on
      me, O Lord, for I am week” (Ps 6:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, due to the rule and victory of a man’s passions, his reason is
      blinded by consent; and he says as to this,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">blind,</span> that is, through sins.
      According to Wisdom (2:21): “Their own evil blinded them”; and in the
      Psalm (57:9): “Fire,” that is the fire of anger and concupiscence, “fell
      on them, and they did not see the sun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, a person who is feeble and blind is inconstant in his works and
      is, in a way, lame. So we read in Proverbs (11:18): “The work of the
      wicked is unsteady.” With respect to this the Evangelist says, lame. “How
      long will you be lame?” (1 Kgs 18:2 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourthly, a man who is thus feeble, blind in understanding, and lame in
      his exterior actions, becomes dry in his affections, in the sense that all
      the fatness of devotion withers within him. This devotion is sought in the
      Psalm (62:6): “May my soul be filled with fat and marrow.” With respect to
      this the Evangelist says, withered. “My strength is dried up like baked
      clay” (Ps 21:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are some so afflicted by the lassitude of sin, who do not wait
      for the motion of the water, wallowing in their sins, according to Wisdom
      (14:22): “They live in a great strife of ignorance, and they call so many
      and great evils peace.” We read of such people: “They are glad when they
      do evil, and rejoice in the worst of things” (Prv 2:14). The reason for
      this is that they do not hate their sins: they do not sin from ignorance
      or weakness, but from malice. But others, who do not sin from malice, do
      not wallow in their sins, but wait by desire for the motion of the water.
      So he says, <span style="font-weight: bold">waiting.</span> “Every day of
      my service I wait for my relief to come” (Jb 14:14). This is the ‘way
      those in the Old Testament waited for Christ: “I will wait for your
      salvation, O Lord” (Gn 49:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      707 Finally, the power of the pool is described, for it healed all
      physical illnesses in virtue of an angel who came to it; so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >From time to time an angel of the Lord used to come down into the
        pool.</span
      >
      In certain ways, the power of this pool is like that of Baptism. It is
      like it, first, in the fact that its power was unperceived: for the power
      of the water in this pool did not come from its very nature, otherwise it
      would have healed at all times; its power was unseen, being from an angel.
      So he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >From time to time an angel of the Lord used to come down into the
        pool.</span
      >
      The water of Baptism is like this in that precisely as water it does not
      have the power to cleanse souls, but this comes from the unseen power of
      the Holy Spirit, according to: “Unless one is born again ofwater and the
      Holy Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God” (above 3:5). It is like
      it, in a second way, in its effect: for as the water of Baptism heals, so
      also the water of that pool healed. So he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the first one into the pool was healed.</span
      >
      Further, God gave to that water the power to heal so that men by washing
      might learn through their bodily health to seek their spiritual health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the water of this pool differs from the water of Baptism in three
      ways. First, in the source of its power: for the water in the pool
      produced health because of an angel, but the water of Baptism produces its
      effect by the uncreated power not only of the Holy Spirit, but of the
      entire Trinity. Thus the entire Trinity was present at the baptism of
      Christ: the Father in the voice, the Son in person, and the Holy Spirit in
      the form of a dove. This is why we invoke the Trinity in our baptism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, this water differs in its power: for the water in the pool did
      not have a continuous power to cure, but only
      <span style="font-weight: bold">from time to time;</span> while the water
      of Baptism has a permanent power to cleanse, according to: “On that day a
      fountain will be open to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of
      Jerusalem, to cleanse the sinner and the unclean” (Zee 13:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, this water differs as regards the number of people healed: for
      only one person was cured when the water of this pool was moved; but all
      are healed when the water of Baptism is moved. And no wonder: for the
      power of the water in the pool, since it is created, is finite and has a
      finite effect; but in the water of Baptism there is an infinite power
      capable of cleansing an infinite number of souls, if there were such: “I
      will pour clean water upon you, and you will be cleansed from all your
      uncleanness” (Ez 36:25).
    </p>
    <p>
      708 According to Augustine, however, the angel signifies Christ, according
      to this reading of Isaiah (9:6): “He will be called great counsel.” Just
      as the angel descended at certain times into the pool, so Christ descended
      into the world at a time fixed by the Father: “The time is near” (Is
      14:1); “When the fulness of time had come God sent his Son, made from a
      woman, inade under the law” (Gal 4:4). Again, just as the angel was not
      seen except by the motion of the water, so Christ was not known as to his
      divinity, for “If they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord
      of glory” (1 Cor 2:8). For as Isaiah (45:15) says: “Truly, you are a
      hidden God.” And so the motion of the water was seen, but not the one who
      set it in motion, because, seeing the weakness of Christ, the people did
      not know of his divinity. And just as the one who went into the pool was
      healed, so a person who humbly believes in God is healed by his passion:
      “Justified by faith, through the redemption which is in Christ, whoin God
      put forward as an expiation” (Rom 3:24). Only one was healed, because no
      one can be healed except in the oneness or unity of the Church: “One Lord,
      one faith, one baptism” (Eph 4:5). Therefore, woe to those who hate unity,
      and divide men into sects.
    </p>
    <p>
      709 Then (v 5), the Evangelist mentions the disability of a man who lay by
      the pool. First, we are told how long he was disabled; and secondly, why
      it was so long (v 7).
    </p>
    <p>
      7 10 He was disabled for a long time, for
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >There was one man lying there who had been sick for thirty-eight years
        with his infirmity.</span
      >
      This episode is very aptly mentioned: the man who could not be cured by
      the pool was to be cured by Christ, because those whom the law could not
      heal, Christ heals perfectly, according to: “God did what the law,
      weakened by the flesh, could not do: by sending his own Son in the
      likeness of sinful flesh, and as a sin-offering, he condemned sin in his
      flesh” (Rom 8:3), and in Sirach (36:6): “Perform new signs and wonders.”
    </p>
    <p>
      711 The number thirty-eight is well-suited to his infirmity, for we see it
      associated with sickness rather than with health. For, as Augustine says,
      the number forty signifies the perfection of justice, which consists in
      observing the law. But the law was given in ten precepts, and was to be
      preached to the four corners of the world, or be completed by the four
      Gospels, according to: “The end of the law is Christ” (Rom 10:4). So since
      ten times four is forty, this appropriately signifies perfect justice. Now
      if two is subtracted from forty, we get thirty-eight. This two is the two
      precepts of charity, which effects perfect justice. And so this man was
      sick because he had forty minus two, that is, his justice was imperfect,
      for “On these two commandments all the law and the prophets depend” (Mt
      22:40).
    </p>
    <p>
      712 Now the reason for the length of the man’s illness is considered.
      First, we have the Lord’s query; secondly, the sick man’s answer (v 7).
    </p>
    <p>
      713 John says, Jesus, seeing him, the man,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">lying there.</span> Jesus saw him not only
      with his physical eyes, but also with the eyes of his mercy; this is the
      way David begged to be seen, saying: “Look.at me, O Lord, and have mercy
      on me” (Ps 85:16). And Jesus
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >knowing that he had been sick a long time</span
      >
      —which was repugnant to the heart of Christ as well as to the sick man
      himself: “A long illness is a burden to the physician” (Sir 10:11)—said to
      him, <span style="font-weight: bold">Do you wish to be healed?</span> He
      did not say this because he did not know the answer, for it was quite
      evident that the man wanted to be healed, he said it to arouse the sick
      man’s desire, and to show his patience in waiting so many years to be
      cured of his sickness. and in not giving up. We see from this that he was
      all the worthier to be cured: “Act bravely, and let your heart be
      strengthened, all you who hope in the Lord” (Ps 30:25). Jesus incites the
      man’s desires because we keep more securely what we perceive with desire
      and more easily acquire. “Knock,” by your desire, “and it will be opened
      to you,” as we read in Matthew (7:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that in other situations the Lord requires faith: “Do you believe
      that I can do this for you” (Mt 9:28); but here he does not make any such
      demand. The reason is that the others had heard of the miracles of Jesus,
      of which this man knew nothing. And so Jesus does not ask faith from him
      until after the miracle has been performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      714 Then (v 7), the answer of the sick man is given. Two reasons are given
      for the length of his illness: his poverty and his weakness. As he was
      poor, he could not afford a man to plunge him into the pool; so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Sir, I have no one to plunge me into the pool.</span
      >
      Perhaps he thought, as Chrysostom says, that Christ might even help to put
      him into the water. Someone else always reached the pool before him
      because he was weak and not able to move fast; so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >By the time I get there, someone else has gone in before me.</span
      >
      He could say with Job: “I cannot help myself” (Jb 6:13). This signifies
      that no mere man could save the human race, for all had sinned and needed
      the grace of God. Mankind had to wait for the coming of Christ, God and
      man, by whom it would be healed.
    </p>
    <p>
      715 Now we see the man restored to health, i.e., the working of the
      miracle. First, the Lord’s command is given; secondly, the man’s obedience
      (v 9).
    </p>
    <p>
      716 The Lord commanded both the nature of the man and his will, for both
      are under the Lord’s power. He commanded his nature when he said, Stand
      up. This command was not directed to the man’s will, for this was not
      within the power of his will. But it was within the power of his nature,
      to which the Lord gave the power to stand by his command. He gave two
      commands to the man’s will:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">pick up your mat and walk!</span> The
      literal meaning for this is that these two things were commanded in order
      to show that the man had been restored to perfect health. For in all his
      miracles the Lord produced a perfect work, according to what was best in
      the nature of each case: “The works of God are perfect” (Dt 32:4). Now
      this man was lacking two things: first, his own energy, since he could not
      stand up by himself, thus our Lord found him lying by the pool. Secondly,
      he lacked the help of others; so he said,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I have no one.</span> So our Lord, in
      order that this man might recognize his perfect health, ordered him who
      could not help himself to pick up his mat, and him who could not walk to
      walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      717 These are the three things which the Lord commands in the
      justification of a sinner. First, he should
      <span style="font-weight: bold">stand up,</span> by leaving his sinful
      ways: “Rise up, you who sleep, and arise from the dead” (Eph 5:14).
      Secondly, he is commanded to
      <span style="font-weight: bold">pick up your mat</span>, by making
      satisfaction for the sins he has committed. For the mat on which a man
      rests signifies his sins. And so a man takes up his mat when he begins to
      do the penance given to him for his sins. “I will bear the anger of God,
      because I have sinned against him” (Mi 7:9). Thirdly, he is commanded to
      <span style="font-weight: bold">walk</span>, by advancing in what is good,
      according to: “They will go from strength to strength” (Ps 83:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      718 According to Augustine, this sick man was lacking two things: the two
      precepts of charity. And so our Lord gives two commands to his will, which
      is perfected by charity: to take up his mat, and to walk. The first
      concerns the love of neighbor, which is first in the order of doing; the
      second concerns the love of God, which is first in the order of precept.
      Christ says, with respect to the first,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">pick up you mat.</span> As if to say: When
      you are weak, your neighbor bears with you and, like a mat, patiently
      supports you: “We who are stronger ought to bear with the infirmities of
      the weak, and not seek to please ourselves” (Rom 15:1). Thus, after you
      have been cured,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">pick up your mat,</span> i.e., bear and
      support your neighbor, who carried you when you were weak: “Carry each
      other’s burdens” (Gal 6:2). About the second he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">walk,</span> by drawing near God; so we
      read: “They will go from strength to strength” (Ps 83:8); “Walk while you
      have the light” (below 12:35).
    </p>
    <p>
      719 Next we see the man’s obedience. First, the obedience of his nature,
      because,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">The man was immediately cured.</span> And
      no wonder, because Christ is the Word through whom heaven and earth were
      made: “He commanded and they were created” (Ps 148:5); “By the Word of the
      Lord the heavens were made” (Ps 32:6). Secondly, we see the obedience of
      the man’s will: first, because
      <span style="font-weight: bold">he picked up his mat,</span> and secondly,
      because he <span style="font-weight: bold">walked.</span> “We will do
      everything that the Lord commands, and obey him” (Ex 24:7).

      <span style="font-weight: bold">LECTURE 2</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        9b That day, however, was a Sabbath. 10 Therefore the Jews told the man
        who had been cured, “It is the Sabbath; it is not permitted for you to
        carry your mat.” 11 He replied to them, “He who cured me said to me:
        ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’” 12 They then asked him, “Who is this man
        who told you to pick up your mat and walk?” 13 But he who was cured had
        no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away from the crowd that had
        gathered in that place. 14 Later, Jesus found the man in the temple and
        said to him, “Remember, you have been made well; now do not sin again
        lest something worse happen to you.” 15 The man went off and related to
        the Jews that it was Jesus who had cured him. 16 For reasons like this
        the Jews began to persecute Jesus, because he performed such works on
        the Sabbath. 17 But Jesus had a reply for them: “My Father works even
        until now, and so do I.” 18 Consequently, the Jews tried all the harder
        to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath rest, but even called
        God his own Father, making himself equal to God.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      720 Having seen a visible miracle which shows the power of Christ to
      restore spiritual life, we now see an opportunity given to him to teach.
      This opportunity was the persecution launched against him by the Jews.
      These Jews, who were envious of Christ, persecuted him for two reasons:
      first, the above act of his mercy; secondly, his teaching of the truth (v
      17). As to the first, the Evangelist does three things. First, he gives
      the occasion for their persecution. Secondly, the false accusation against
      the man who was just cured (v 10). And thirdly, their attempt to belittle
      Christ (v 12).
    </p>
    <p>
      721 Their opportunity to persecute Christ was the fact that he cured the
      man on the Sabbath; accordingly, the Evangelist says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">That day, however, was a Sabbath,</span>
      when Christ performed the miracle ofcommanding the man to pick up his mat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three reasons are given why our Lord began to work on the Sabbath. The
      first is given by Ambrose, in his commentary, <i>On Luke.</i> He says that
      Christ came to renovate the work of creation, that is, man, who had become
      deformed. And so he should have begun where the Creator had left off the
      work of creation, that is, on a Sabbath, as mentioned in Genesis (c 1).
      Thus Christ began to work on the Sabbath to show that he was the renovator
      of the whole creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason was that the Sabbath day was celebrated by the Jews in
      memory of the first creation. But Christ came to make, in a way, a new
      creature, according to Galatians (6:15): “In Christ Jesus, neither
      circumcision nor the lack of circumcision is a benefit; what counts is a
      new creation,” i.e., through grace, which comes through the Holy Spirit:
      “You will send forth your Spirit, and they will be created; and you will
      renew the face of the earth” (Ps 103:30). And so Christ worked on the
      Sabbath to show that a new creation, a re-creation, was taking place
      through him: “that we might be the first fruits of his creatures” (Jas
      1:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      The third reason was to show that he was about to do what the law could
      not do: “God did what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do: by
      sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, he condemned sin in
      his flesh, in order that the requirements of the law might be accomplished
      in us” (Rom 8:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jews, however, did not do any work on the Sabbath, as a symbol that
      there were certain things pertaining to the Sabbath which were to be
      accomplished, but which the law could not do. This is clear in the four
      things which God ordained for the Sabbath: for he sanctified the Sabbath
      day, blessed it, completed his work on it, and then rested. These things
      the law was not able to do. It could not sanctify; so we read: “Save me, O
      Lord, for there are no holy people left” (Ps 11:1). Nor could it bless;
      rather, “Those who rely on the works of the law are under a curse” (Gal
      3:10). Neither could it, complete and perfect, because “the law brought
      nothing to perfection” (Heb 7:19). Nor could it bring perfect rest: “If
      Joshua had given them rest, God would not be speaking after of another
      day” (Heb 4:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      These things, which the law could not do, Christ did. For he sanctified
      the people by his passion: “Jesus, in order to sanctify the people with
      his own blood, suffered outside the gate” (Heb 13:12). He blessed them by
      an inpouring of grace: “Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus
      Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing of heaven, in
      Christ” (Eph 1:3). He brought the people to perfection by instructing them
      in the ways of perfect justice: “Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is
      perfect” (Mt 5:48). He also led them to true rest: “We who have believed
      will find rest,” as is said in Hebrews (4:3). Therefore, it is proper for
      him to work on the Sabbath, who is able to make perfect those things that
      pertain to the Sabbath, from which an impotent law rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      722 Then (v 10), the Evangelist gives the accusation brought against the
      man who was healed. First, we have the accusation; and secondly, the
      explanation given by the man who was healed (v 11).
    </p>
    <p>
      723 The man was accused for carrying his mat on the Sabbath, and not for
      being healed; so they say:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >It is the Sabbath; it is not permitted for you to carry your mat.</span
      >
      There are several reasons foi this. One is that the Jews, although
      frequently charging Christ with healing on the Sabbath, had been
      embarrassed by him on the ground that they themselves used to pull their
      cattle from ditches on the Sabbath in order to save them. For this reason
      the Jews did not mention his healing, as it was useful and necessary; but
      they charge him with carrying his mat, which did not seem to be necessary.
      As if to say: Although your cure need not have been postponed, there was
      no need for you to carry your mat, or for the order to carry it. Another
      reason was that the Lord had shown, contrary to their opinion, that it was
      lawful to do good on the Sabbath. And so, because being healed is not the
      same as doing good, but being done a good, they attack the one healed
      rather than the one healing. The third reason was that the Jews thought
      that they were forbidden by the law to do any work on the Sabbath; and it
      was the carrying of burdens that was especially forbidden on the Sabbath:
      “Do not carry a burden on the Sabbath” (Jer 17:2 1). Accordingly, they
      made a special point of being against the carrying of anything on the
      Sabbath, as being opposed to the teaching of the prophet. But this command
      of the prophet was mystical: for when he forbade them to carry burdens, he
      wanted to encourage them to rest from the burdens of their sins on the
      Sabbath. Of these sins it is said: “My iniquities are a heavy burden and
      have weighed me down” (Ps 37.5). Therefore, since the time had come to
      explain the meaning of obscure symbols, Christ commanded him to take up
      his mat, i.e, to help his neighbors in their weaknesses: “Bear one
      another’s burdens, and so you will fulfil the law of Christ” (Gal 6:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      724 Then (v 11), we see the man who was healed defending himself. His
      defense is wisely taken: for a doctrine is never so well proved to be
      divinely inspired as by miracles which can be accomplished only by divine
      power: “Going out, they preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them
      and confirmed the word by the signs that followed” (Mk 16:20). Thus he
      argued with those who were defaming the one who healed him, saying:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">He who cured me said to me.</span> As if
      to say: You say that I am forbidden to carry a burden on the Sabbath, and
      this on divine authority; but I was commanded by the same authority to
      pick up my mat. For,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">he who cured me,</span> and by restoring
      my health showed that he had divine power, said to me,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Pick up your mat and walk.</span>
      Therefore, I was duty bound to obey the commands of one who has such power
      and who had done me such a favor. “I will never forget your precepts
      because you have brought me to life by them” (Ps 118:93).
    </p>
    <p>
      725 Then, since they could not very well charge the man who was cured,
      they try to belittle Christ’s cure, for this man defended himself through
      Christ. But since he did not indicate precisely who he was, they
      maliciously ask him who it was. With respect to this, first, the search
      for Christ is set down. Secondly, his discovery. And thirdly, his
      persecution (v 16).
    </p>
    <p>
      726 Three things are mentioned about the first: the Jews’ interrogation;
      the ignorance of the man who was cured, and the cause of that ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the first, we read:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">They then asked him,</span> not with the
      good intention of making progress, but for the evil purpose of persecuting
      and destroying Christ: “You will seek me, and you will die in your sin”
      (below 8:21), Their very words show their malice: for while our Lord had
      commanded the man who was sick to become healed and to pick up his mat,
      they ignored the first, which is an undeniable sign of divine power, and
      harped on the second, which seemed to be against the law, saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Who is this man who told you to pick up you mat and walk?</span
      >
      “He lies in wait, and turns good into evil, and he will put blame,” i.e.,
      attempt to put blame, “on the elect” (Sir 11:33).
    </p>
    <p>
      727 As to the second, the Evangelist says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >But he who was cured had no idea who it was.</span
      >
      This cured man signifies those who believe and have been healed by the
      grace of Christ: “You are saved by grace” (Eph 2:8). Indeed, they do not
      know who Christ is, but they know only his effects: “While we are in the
      body, we are absent from the Lord: for we walk by faith, and not by sight”
      (2 Cor 5:6). We will know who Christ is when “we shall see him as he is,”
      as said in 1 John (3:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      728 Next, the Evangelist gives the reason for the man’s ignorance, saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >for Jesus had slipped away from the crowd that had gathered in that
        place.</span
      >
      There are both literal and mystical reasons why Christ left. Of the two
      literal reasons, the first is to give us the example of concealing our
      good deeds and of not using them to seek the applause of men: “Take care
      not to perform your good actions in the sight of men, in order to be seen
      by them” (Mt 6:1). The second literal reason is to show us that, in all
      ouractions, we should leave and avoid those who are envious, so as not to
      feed and increase their envy: “Do not be provoked by one who speaks evil
      of you, so he will not trap you by your own words” (Sir 8:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also two mystical reasons why Christ slipped away. First, it
      teaches us that Christ is not easy to find in the midst of men, or in the
      whirlwind of temporal cares; rather, he is found in spiritual seclusion:
      “I will lead her into the wilderness, and there I will speak to her heart”
      (Hos 2:14); and in Ecclesiastes (9.17): “The words of the wise are heard
      in silence.” Secondly, this suggests to us that Christ was to leave the
      Jews for the Gentiles: “He hid his face for a while from the house of
      Jacob” (Is 8:17), i.e., he withdrew the knowledge of his truth from the
      Jewish people.
    </p>
    <p>
      729 Then (v 14), the Evangelist tells us how Jesus was found. First, he
      says that he was found. Secondly, that after having been found, he taught.
      Thirdly, that after having taught, his identity was reported to the Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      730 The Evangelist tells us both where and the way in which Christ was
      found. The way in which he was found was remarkable, for Christ is not
      found unless he first finds; hence he says, Later, after the above events,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Jesus found the man.</span> For we cannot
      find Jesus by our own power unless Christ first presents himself to us; so
      we read: “Seek your servant” (Ps 118:176); and, “She [wisdom] goes to meet
      those who desire her” (Wis 6:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      The place Christ was found was holy,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">in the temple,</span> according to: “The
      Lord is in his holy temple” (Ps 10:5). For his mother had also found him
      in the temple (Lk 2:46); and he was there for he had to be concerned with
      his Father’s affairs. We see from this that this man was not cured in
      vain, but having been converted to a religious way of life, he visited the
      temple and found Christ: because if we desire to come to a knowledge of
      the Creator, we must run from the tumult of sinful affections, leave the
      company of evil men, and flee to the temple of our heart, where God
      condescends to visit and live.
    </p>
    <p>
      731 After Christ was found, he began to teach (v 14). First, Christ
      reminded the man of the gift he was given. Secondly, he offered him sound
      advice. And thirdly, he pointed out an imminent danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      732 The gift was remarkable, for it was a sudden restoration to health; so
      he says, Remember, you have been made well. Therefore, you should always
      keep this in mind, according to: “I will remember the tender mercies of
      the Lord” (Is 63:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      733 His advice, too, was useful, that is,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">do not sin again.</span> “My son, you have
      sinned. Do not sin again” (Sir 21:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did our Lord mention sin to this paralytic and to certain others that
      he cured, and not to the rest? He did this to show that illness comes to
      certain people as a result of their previous sins, according to: “For this
      reason many of you are weak and sick, and many have died” (1 Cor 11:30).
      In this way he even showed himself to be God, pointing out sins and the
      hidden secrets of the heart: “Hell and destruction are open to the Lord;
      how much more the hearts of the children of men” (Prv 15:11). And so
      Christ mentioned sin only to some he cured and not to all, for not all
      infirmities are due to previous sins: some come from one’s natural
      disposition, and some are permitted as a trial, as with Job. Or, Christ
      might have brought up sin to some because they were better prepared for
      his correction: “Do not rebuke one who mocks, lest he hate you; rebuke a
      wise man, and he will love you” (Prv 9:8). Or, we could say, in telling
      some not to sin, he intended his words for all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      734 The imminent danger was great, so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">lest something worse happen to you.</span>
      This can be understood in two ways, according to the two events that
      preceded. For this man was first punished with a troublesome infirmity,
      and then received a marvelous favor. Accordingly, Christ’s statement can
      refer to each. To the first, for when anyone is punished for his sin, and
      the punishment does not check him from sinning, it is just for him to be
      punished more severely. So Christ says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">do not sin again,</span> because if you do
      sin, something worse will happen to you: “I have struck your children in
      vain” (Jer 2:30). It can refer to the second, for one who falls into sin
      after receiving favors deserves a more severe punishment because of his
      ingratitude, as we see in 2 Peter (2:20): “It would be better for them not
      to know the way of truth, than to turn back after knowing it.” Also,
      because after a man has once returned to sin, he sins more easily,
      according to Matthew (12:45): “The last state of that man becomes worse
      than the first”; and in Jeremiah (2:20): “You broke your yoke a long time
      ago, and snapped off your chains, and said: I will not serve.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      735 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >The man went off and related to the Jews,</span
      >
      we see Jesus identified. Some think, as Chrysostom reports, that this man
      identified Jesus out of malice. But this does not seem probable: that he
      would be so ungrateful after receiving such a favor. He
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >related to the Jews that it was Jesus who had cured him,</span
      >
      in order to make it clear that Christ had the power to heal: “Come... and
      I will tell you what great things the Lord has done for me,” as we read in
      the Psalm (65:16). This is obvious, for they had asked him who commanded
      him to pick up his mat, but he told them that
      <span style="font-weight: bold">it was Jesus who had cured him.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      736 Next (v 16), we have the persecution of Christ, begun because he
      performed a work of mercy on the Sabbath. Thus the Evangelist says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >For reasons like this the Jews began to persecute Jesus, because he
        performed such works on the Sabbath.</span
      >
      “Princes have persecuted me without cause” (Ps 118:16 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      737 Then (v 17), the second reason for his persecution is given: what he
      taught. First, we are given the truth he taught; and secondly, the
      perversity of his persecutors (v 18).
    </p>
    <p>
      73 8 Our Lord taught the truth while justifying his breaking of the
      Sabbath. Here we should note that our Lord justified both himself and his
      disciples from breaking the Sabbath. He justified his disciples, since
      they were men, by comparing them to other men: as the priests who,
      although they worked in the temple on the Sabbath, did not break the
      Sabbath; and to David, who, while Ahinielech was priest, took the
      consecrated bread from the temple oil the Sabbath when he was running from
      Saul (1 Sm 21:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Lord, who was both God and man, sometimes justified himself in
      breaking the Sabbath by comparing himself to men, as in Luke (14:5):
      “Which of you, if his donkey or ox falls into a pit, will not take him out
      on the Sabbath?” And sometimes he justified himself by comparing himself
      to God: particularly on this occasion, when he said:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >My Father works even until now, and so do I.</span
      >
      As if to say: Do not think that my Father rested on the Sabbath in such a
      way that from that time he does not work; rather, just as he is working
      even now without laboring, so I also am working.
    </p>
    <p>
      By saying this, Christ eliminated the misunderstanding of the Jews: for in
      their desire to imitate God, they did not do any work on the Sabbath, as
      if God entirely ceased from work on that day. In fact, although God rested
      on the Sabbath from producing new creatures, he is working always and
      continuously even till now, conserving creatures in existence. Hence it is
      significant that Moses used the word “rest,” after recounting the works of
      God from which he rested: for this signifies, in its hidden meaning, the
      spiritual rest which God, by the example of his own rest, promised to the
      faithful, after they have done their own good works. So we may say that
      this command was a foreshadowing of something that lay in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      739 He expressly says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">works even until now,</span> and not “has
      worked,” to indicate that God’s work is continuous. For they might have
      thought that God is the cause of the world as a craftsman is the cause of
      a house, i.e., the craftsman is responsible only for the making or coming
      into existence of the house: in other words, just as the house continues
      in existence even when the craftsman has ceased working, so the world
      would exist if God’s influence ceased. But according to Augustine, God is
      the cause of all creatures in such a way as to be the cause of their
      existing: for it his power were to cease even for a moment, all things in
      nature would at once cease to be, just as we may say that the air is
      illuminated only as long as the light of the sun remains in it. The reason
      for this is that things which depend on a cause only for their coming into
      existence, are able to exist when that cause ceases; but things that
      depend on a cause not only for their coming into existence but also to
      exist, need that cause for their continuous conservation in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      740 Further, in saying that
      <span style="font-weight: bold">My Father works even until now,</span> he
      rejects the opinion of those who say that God creates through the
      instrumentality of secondary causes. This opinion conflicts with Isaiah
      (26:12): “O Lord, you have accomplished all our works for LIS.” Therefore,
      just as my <span style="font-weight: bold">Father,</span> who in the
      beginning created nature,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">works even until now, by</span> preserving
      and conserving his creation by the same activity, so (to I work, because I
      am the Word of the Father, through whom he accomplishes all things: “God
      said: ‘Let there be light’” (Gn 1:3). Thus, just as he accomplished the
      first production of things through the Word, so also their conservation.
      Consequently, if he
      <span style="font-weight: bold">works even until now, so do I,</span>
      because I am the Word of the Father, through whom all things are made and
      conserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      741 Then (v 18), the Evangelist mentions the persecution of Christ, which
      resulted from his teaching: for it was because of his teaching that
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the Jews tried all the harder,</span>
      i.e., with greater eagerness and a higher pitch of zeal,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">to kill him.</span> For in the law two
      crimes were punished by death: the crime of breaking the Sabbath—thus
      anyone who gathered wood on the Sabbath was stoned, as we see from Numbers
      (15:32); and the crime of blasphemy—so we read: “Bring the blasphemer
      outside the camp... and let all the children of Israel stone him” (Lv
      24:14). Now they thought it was blasphemy for a man to claim that he was
      God: “We are not stoning you for any good work, but for blasphemy: because
      although you are a man, you make yourself God” (below 10:33). It was these
      two crimes they imputed to Christ: the first because he broke the Sabbath;
      the second because he said he was equal to God. So the Evangelist says
      that
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Jews tried all the harder to kill him, because he not only broke
        the Sabbath rest, but even called God his own Father.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Because other just man had also called God their Father, as in “You will
      call me ‘Father’” (Jer 3:19), they do not just say that he
      <span style="font-weight: bold">called God his own Father,</span> but
      added what made it blasphemy,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">making himself equal to God,</span> which
      they understood from his statement:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >My Father works even until now, and so do I.</span
      >
      He said that God was his Father so that we might understand that God is
      his Father by nature, and the Father of others by adoption. He referred to
      both of these when he said: “I am going to my Father,” by nature, “and to
      your Father,” by grace (below 20:17). Again, he said that as the Father
      works, so he works. This answers the accusation of the Jews about his
      breaking the Sabbath: for this would not be a valid excuse unless he had
      equal authority with God in working. It was for this reason they said he
      made himself equal to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      742 How great then is the blindness of the Arians when they. say that
      Christ is less than God the Father: for they cannot understand in our
      Lord’s words what the Jews were able to understand. For the Arians say
      that Christ did not make himself equal to God, while the Jews saw this.
      There is another way to settle this, from the very things mentioned in the
      text. For the Evangelist says that the Jews persecuted Christ because he
      broke the Sabbath, because he said God is his Father, and because he made
      hiniselfequal to God. But Christ is either a liar or equal to God. But if
      he is equal to God, Christ is God by nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      743 Finally, the Evangelist says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">making himself equal to God,</span> not as
      though he was making himself become equal to God, because he was equal to
      God through an eternal generation. Rather, the Evangelist is speaking
      according to the understanding of the Jews who, not believing that Christ
      was the Son of God by nature, understood him to say that he was the Son of
      God in the sense of wishing to make himself equal to God; but they could
      not believe he was such: “because although you are a man, you make
      yourself God” (below 10:33), i.e., you say that you are God, understanding
      this as you wish to make yourself God.

    <p>
      744 Here we have Christ’s teaching on his life-giving power. First, his
      teaching is presented. Secondly, it is confirmed (v 3 1). Two things are
      done with the first. First, Christ’s teaching on his life-giving power in
      general is given. Secondly, it is presented in particular (v 20b). As to
      the first, three things are done. First, the origin of this power is
      mentioned. Secondly, the greatness of this power, at (v 19b). Thirdly, the
      reason for each is given (v 20).
    </p>
    <p>
      745 We should point out, with respect to the first, that the Arians use
      what Christ said here,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Son cannot do anything of himself,</span
      >
      to support their error that the Son is less than the Father. As the
      Evangelist said, the Jews persecuted Christ for making himself equal to
      God. But the Arians say that when our Lord saw that this disturbed the
      Jews, he tried to correct this by stating that he was not equal to the
      Father, saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Amen, amen, I say to you, the Son cannot do anything of himself, but
        only what he sees the Father doing.</span
      >
      As if to say: Do not interpret what I said, “My Father works even until
      now, and so do I, as meaning that I work as though I am equal to the
      Father. for I cannot do anything of myself. Therefore, they say, because
      the Son can do only
      <span style="font-weight: bold">what he sees the Father doing</span>, he
      is less than the Father. But this interpretation is false and erroneous.
      For if the Son were not equal to the Father, then the Son would not be the
      same as the Father; and this is contrary to: “I and the Father are one”
      (below 10:30). For equality is considered with respect to greatness, which
      in divine realities is the essence itself. Hence, if the Son were not
      equal to the Father, he would be different from him in essence.
    </p>
    <p>
      746 To get the true meaning of Christ’s statement, we should know that in
      those matters which seem to imply inferiority in the Son, it could be
      said, as some do, that they apply to Christ according to the nature he
      assumed; as when he said: “The Father is greater than I” (below 14:28).
      According to this, they would say that our Lord’s statement,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Son cannot do anything of himself,</span
      >
      should be understood of the Son in his assumed nature. However, this does
      not stand up, because then one would be forced to say that whatever the
      Son of God did in his assumed nature, the Father had done before him. For
      example, that the Father had walked upon the water as Christ did:
      otherwise, he would not have said,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >but only what he sees the Father doing.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      And if we say that whatever Christ did in his flesh, God the Father also
      did in so far as the Father works in him, as said below (14:10): “The
      Father, who lives in me, he accomplishes the works,” then Christ would be
      saying that
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Son cannot do anything of himself, but only what he sees the Father
        doing</span
      >
      in him, i.e., in the Son. But this cannot stand either, because Christ’s
      next statement,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >For whatever the Father, does, the Son does likewise,</span
      >
      could not, in this interpretation, be applied to him, i.e., to Christ. For
      the Son, in his assumed nature, never created the world, as the Father
      did. Consequently, what we read here must not be understood as pertaining
      to Christ’s assumed nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      747 According to Augustine, however, there is another way of understanding
      statements which seem to, but do not, imply inferriority in the Son:
      namely, by referring them to the origin of the Son coming or begotten from
      the Father. For although the Son is equal to the Father in all things, he
      receives all these things from the Father in an eternal begetting. But the
      Father gets these from no one, for he is unbegotten. According to this
      explanation, the continuity of thought is the following: Why are you
      offended because I said that God is my Father, and because I made myself
      equal to the Father?
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Amen, amen, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself.</span
      >
      As if to say: I am equal to the Father, but in such a way as to be from
      him, and not he from me; and whatever I may do, is in me from the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      748 According to this interpretation, mention is made of the power of the
      Son when he says, can, and of his activity when he says, do. Both can be
      understood here, so that, first of all, the derivation of the Son’s power
      from the Father is shown, and secondly, the conformity of the Son’s
      activity to that of the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      749 As to the first, Hilary explains it this way: Shortly above our Lord
      said that he is equal to the Father. Some heretics, basing themselves on
      certain scriptural texts which assert the unity and equality of the Son to
      the Father, claim that the Son is unbegotten. For example, the Sabellians,
      who say that the Son is identical in person with the Father. Therefore, so
      you do not understand this teaching in this way, he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Son cannot do anything of himself,</span
      >
      for the Son’s power is identical with his nature. Therefore the Son has
      his power from the same source as he has his being (<i>esse</i>); but he
      has his being (<i>esse</i>) from the Father: “I came forth from the
      Father, and I have come into the world” (Jn 16:28). He also has his nature
      from the Father, because he is God from God; therefore, it is from him
      that the Son has his power (<i>posse</i>) <i>.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      So his statement,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Son cannot do anything of himself, but only what he sees the Father
        doing,</span
      >
      is the same as saying: The Son, just as he does not have his being
      (<i>esse</i>) except from the Father, so he cannot do anything except from
      the Father. For in natural things, a thing receives its power to act from
      the very thing from which it receives its being: for example, fire
      receives its power to ascend from the very thing from which it receives
      its form and being. Further, in saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Son cannot do anything of himself,</span
      >
      no inequality is implied, because this refers to a relation; while
      equality and inequality refer to quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      750 Someone might misunderstand his saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >but only what he sees the Father doing,</span
      >
      and take it to mean that the Son works or acts in the way he sees the
      Father acting, i.e., that the Father acts first, and when the Son sees
      this, then the Son begins to act. It would be like two carpenters, a
      master and his apprentice, with the apprentice making a cabinet in the way
      he saw the master do. But this is not true for the Word, for it was said
      above (1:3): “All things were made through him.” Therefore, the Father did
      not make something in such a way that the Son saw him doing it and so
      learned from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is said so that the communication of paternity to the Son might
      be designated in terms of begetting or generation, which is fittingly
      described by the verb sees, because knowledge is conveyed to us by another
      through seeing and hearing. For we receive our knowledge from things
      through seeing. and we receive knowledge from words through hearing, Now
      the Son is not other than Wisdom, as we read: “I came forth out of the
      mouth of the Most High, the first-born before all creatures” (Sir 24:5).
      Accordingly, the derivation of the Son from the Father is nothing other
      than the derivation of divine Wisdom. And so, because the act of seeing
      indicates the derivation of knowledge and wisdom from another, it is
      proper for the generation of the Son from the Father to be indicated by an
      act of seeing; so that for the Son to see the Father doing something is
      nothing other than to proceed by an intellectual procession from the
      acting Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another possible explanation of this is given by Hilary. For him, the word
      sees eliminates all imperfection from the generation of the Son or Word.
      For in physical generation, what is generated changes little by little in
      the course of time from what is imperfect to what is perfect, for such a
      thing is not perfect when it is first generated. But this is not so in
      eternal generation, since this is the generation of what is perfect from
      what is perfect. And so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >but only what he sees the Father doing.</span
      >
      For since the act of seeing is the act of a perfect thing, it is plain
      that the Son was begotten as perfect at once, as seeing at once, and not
      as coming to perfection over a course of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      751 Apropos of the second point, Chrysostom explains it as showing the
      conformity of the Father to the Son in operation. So that the sense is: I
      say that it is lawful for me to work on the Sabbath, because my Father,
      too, continues to work, and I cannot do anything opposed to him: and this
      is because
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Son cannot do anything of himself.</span
      >
      For one does something of himself when he does not conform himself to
      another in his actions. But whoever is from another sins, if he is opposed
      to him: “Whoever speaks on his own, seeks his own glory” (below 7:18).
      Therefore, whoever exists from another, but acts of himself, sins. Now the
      Son is from the Father; thus, if he acts of himself, he sins; and this is
      impossible. So by saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Son cannot do anything of himself,</span
      >
      he means nothing more than that the Son cannot sin. As if to say: You are
      persecuting me unjustly for breaking the Sabbath, because I cannot sin,
      since I do not act in a way opposed to my Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustine makes use of both of these explanations, that of of Hilary and
      the one given by Chrysostom, but in different places.
    </p>
    <p>
      752 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >For whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise,</span
      >
      he affirms the greatness of Christ’s power. He excludes three things in
      the power of Christ: limitation, difference, and imperfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, limitation is excluded. Since there are diverse agents in the
      world, and the first universal agent has power over all other agents, but
      the other agents, which are from him, have a limited power in proportion
      to their rank in the order of causality, some might think that since the
      Son is not of himself, that he must have a power limited to certain
      existents, rather than a universal power over all, as the Father has. And
      so to exclude this he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">whatever the Father does,</span> i.e., to
      all the things to which the Father’s power extends, the Son’s power also
      extends: “All things were made through him” (above 1:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, difference is excluded. For sometimes a thing that exists from
      another is able to do whatever that from which it exists does. And yet the
      things the former does are not the same as those done by that from which
      it is. For example, if one fire which exists from another can do whatever
      that other does, i.e., cause combustion, the act of causing combustion
      would be specifically the same in each, even though one fire ignites
      certain things and the other fire ignites different things. And so that
      you do not think that the Son’s activity is different from the activity of
      the Father in this way, he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">whatever</span> the Father does, the Son
      does, i.e., not different things, but the very same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, imperfection is excluded. Sometimes one and the same thing comes
      from two agents: from one as the principal and perfect agent, and from the
      other as an instrumental and imperfect agent. But it does not come in the
      same way, because the principal agent acts in a different way from the
      instrumental agent: for the instrumental agent acts imperfectly, and in
      virtue of the other. And so that no one thinks that this is the way the
      Son does whatever the Father does, he says that whatever the Father does,
      the Son does <span style="font-weight: bold">likewise</span>, i.e., with
      the same power by which the Father acts, the Son also acts; because the
      same power and the same perfection are in the Father and the Son: “I was
      with him, forming all things” (Prv 8:30).
    </p>
    <p>
      753 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">For the Father loves the Son,</span> he
      gives the reason for each, i.e., for the origin of the Son’s power and for
      its greatness. This reason is the love of the Father, who loves the Son.
      Thus he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">For the Father loves the Son.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to understand how the Father’s love for the Son is the reason for
      the origin or communication of the Son’s power, we Should point out that a
      thing is loved in two ways. For since the good alone is loveable, a good
      can be related to love in two ways: as the cause of love, or as caused by
      love. Now in us, the good causes love: for the cause of our loving
      something is its goodness, the goodness in it. Therefore, it is not good
      because we love it, but rather we love it because it is good. Accordingly.
      in us, love is caused by what is good. But it is different with God,
      because God’s love itself is the cause of the goodness in the things that
      are loved. For it is because God loves us that we are good, since to love
      is nothing else than to will a good to someone. Thus, since God’s will is
      the cause of things, for “whatever he willed he made” (Ps 113:3), it is
      clear that God’s love is the cause of the goodness in things. Hence Denis
      says in <i>The Divine Names</i> (c. 4) that the divine love did not allow
      itself to be without issue. So, if we wish to consider the origin of the
      Son, let us see whether the love with which the Father loves the Son, is
      the principle of his origin, so that he proceeds from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In divine realities, love is taken in two ways: essentially, so far as the
      Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit love; and notionally or personally,
      so far as the Holy Spirit proceeds as Love. But in neither of these ways
      of taking love can it be the principle of origin of the Son. For if is is
      taken essentially, it implies an act of the will; and if that were the
      sense in which it is the principle of origin of the Son, it would follow
      that the Father generated the Son, not by nature, but by will—and this is
      false. Again, love is not understood notionally, as pertaining to the Holy
      Spirit. For it would then follow that the Holy Spirit would be the
      principle of the Son—which is also false. Indeed, no heretic ever went so
      far as to say this. For although love, notionally taken, is the principle
      of all the gifts given to us by God, it is nevertheless not the principle
      of the Son; rather it proceeds from the Father and the Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, we must say that this explanation is not taken from love as
      from a principle (<i>ex principio</i>), but as from a sign (<i>ex signo</i
      >) <i>.</i> For since likeness is a cause of love (for every animal loves
      its like), wherever a perfect likeness of God is found, there also is
      found a perfect love of God. But the perfect likeness of the Father is in
      the Son, as is said: “He is the image of the invisible God” (1:15); and
      “He is the brightness of the Father’s glory, and the image of his
      substance” (Heb 1:3). Therefore, the Son is loved perfectly by the Father,
      and because the Father perfectly loves the Son, this is a sign that the
      Father has shown him everything and has communicated to him his very own
      [the Father’s] power and nature. And it is of this love that we read above
      (3:5): “The Father loves the Son, and has put everything into his hands”;
      and, “This is my beloved. Son” (Mt 3:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      754 With respect to what follows,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >and shows him everything that he does,</span
      >
      we should point out that someone can show another his works in two ways:
      either by sight, as an artisan shows his apprentice the things he has
      made, or by hearing, as when he verbally instructs him). In whatever of
      these ways shows is understood, there can follow something which is not
      appropriate, that is, something that is not present when the Father shows
      things to the Son. For if we say the Father shows things to the Son by
      sight, then it follows, as with humans, that the Father first does
      something which he then shows to the Son; and that he does this by
      himself, without the Son. But the Father does not show the Son things
      which he did before, for the Son himself says: “The Lord possessed me at
      the beginning of his ways, before he made anything” (Prv 8:22). Nor does
      the Father show the Son things he has done without the Son, for the Father
      does all things through the Son: “All things were made through him” (above
      1:3). If <span style="font-weight: bold">shows</span> is understood as a
      kind of hearing, two things seem to follow. For the one who teaches by
      word first points out something to the one who is ignorant; again, the
      word is something intermediate between the one showing and the one being
      shown. But it is in neither of these ways that the Father shows things to
      the Son: for he does not do so to one who is ignorant, since the Son is
      the Wisdom of the Father: “Christ is the power of God, and the wisdom of
      God” (1 Cor 1:24); nor does the Father use some intermediate word, because
      the Son himself is the Word of the Father: “The Word was with God” (above
      1:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, it is said that the Father
      <span style="font-weight: bold">shows</span> all that he does to the Son,
      inasmuch as he gives the Son a knowledge of all of his works. For it is in
      this way that a master is said to show something to his disciple, inasmuch
      as he gives him a knowledge of the things he makes. Hence, according to
      Augustine, for the Father to show anything to the Son is nothing more than
      for the Father to beget or generate the Son. And for the Son to see what
      the Father does is nothing more than for the Son to receive his being
      (<i>esse</i>) and nature from the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, this showing can be considered similar to seeing insofar as
      the Son is the brightness of the paternal vision, as we read in Hebrews
      (1:3): for the Father, seeing and understanding himself, conceives the
      Son, who is the concept of this vision. Again, it can be considered
      similar to hearing insofar as the Son proceeds from the Father as the
      Word. As if to say:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">The Father shows him everything,</span>
      insofar he he generates him as the brightness and concept of his own
      wisdom, and as the Word. Thus the words,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">The Father shows,</span> refer to what was
      said before:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Son cannot do anything of himself, but only what he sees the Father
        doing.</span
      >
      And the word, everything, refers to,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >For whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.</span
      >

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      755 Having pointed out the power of the Son in general, he now shows it in
      more detail. First, the Lord discloses his life-giving power. Secondly, he
      clarifies what seemed obscure in what was said before (v 26). As to the
      first he does two things. First, he shows that the Son has life-giving
      power. Secondly, he teaches how life is received from the Son (v 24).
      Concerning the first he does three things. First, he presents the
      life-giving power of the Son. Secondly, he gives a reason for what he says
      (v 22). Thirdly, he shows the effect of this (v 23). With respect to the
      first he does two things. First, he sets forth this life-giving power in
      general. Secondly, he expands on it (v 21).
    </p>
    <p>
      756 He says, to the first,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Indeed, he will show even greater works than these.</span
      >
      As if to say: You are astonished and affected by the power of the Son in
      his healing of the sick man, but the Father will show
      <span style="font-weight: bold">even greater works than these,</span> as
      in raising the dead, such that you will be amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      757 This passage gives rise to two difficulties. First, about his saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">he will show</span>. For the earlier
      statement that the Father shows everything to the Son (5:20) refers to his
      eternal generation. How, then, can he say here,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">he will show</span>, if the Son is
      coeternal with him and eternity does not allow of a future? The second
      difficulty is over,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">such that you will be amazed</span>. For
      if he intends to show something to amaze the Jews, then he will be showing
      it to the Son at the same time as to them; for they could not be amazed
      unless they saw it. And yet the Son saw all things from eternity with the
      Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      758 We must say that this is explained in three ways. The first way is
      given by Augustine, and in it this future showing is referred to the
      disciples. For it is Christ’s custom that now and then he says that what
      happens to his members happens to himself, as in Matthew (25:40): “As long
      as you did it to one of the least of my brethren, you did it to me.” And
      then the meaning is this: You saw the Son do something great in healing
      the sick man, and you were amazed; but the Father
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >will show him even greater works than these,</span
      >
      in his members, that is, the disciples: “He will do greater things than
      these,” as we read below (14:12). He then says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">such that you will be amazed,</span> for
      the miracles of the disciples so amazed the Jews that a great many of them
      were converted to the faith, as we see in the Acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      759 The second explanation, also by Augustine, refers this showing to
      Christ according to his assumed nature. For in Christ there is both a
      divine nature and a human nature, and in each he has life-giving power
      from the Father, although not in the same way. According to his divinity
      he has the power to give life to souls; but according to his assumed
      nature, he gives life to bodies. Hence Augustine says: “The Word gives
      life to souls; but the Word made flesh gives life to bodies.” For the
      resurrection of Christ and the mysteries which Christ fulfilled in his
      flesh are the cause of the future resurrection of bodies: “God, who is
      rich in mercy, has brought us to life in Christ” (Eph 2:5); “If it is
      preached that Christ rose from the dead, how can some of you say that
      there is no resurrection of the dead” (1 Cor 15:12). The first life-giving
      power he has from eternity; and he indicated this when he said: “The ‘
      Father shows him everything that he does” (above 4:20), all of which he
      shows to his flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other life-giving power he has in time, and concerning this he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >he will show him even greater works than these,</span
      >
      i.e., his power will be shown by the fact that he will do greater works,
      by raising the dead. He will raise some of the dead here: as Lazarus, the
      young girl, and the mother’s only son; and finally he will raise all on
      the day of judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      760 A third explanation refers this showing to Christ in his divine
      nature, according to the custom of Scripture in sayfng that a thing is
      beginning to take place when it is beginning to be known. For example:
      “All power has been given to me, in heaven and on earth” (Mt 28:18); for
      although Christ had the complete fulness of power from eternity (because
      “whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise”), he still speaks of
      this power as being given to him after the resurrection, not because he
      was then receiving it for the first time, but because it was through the
      glory of the resurrection that it became most known. In this
      interpretation, then, he says that power is given to him insofar as he
      exercises it in some work. As if to say:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >he will show him even greater works than these,</span
      >
      i.e., he will show by his works what has been given to him. And this will
      come about when you are amazed, i.e., when the one who seems to you to be
      a mere man is revealed to be a person of divine power and as God.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could also take the word show as referring to an act of seeing, as was
      explained above [750].
    </p>
    <p>
      761 Now he explains in more detail the life-giving power of the Son by
      indicating those greater works which the Father will show the Son (v 21).
      Here we should point out that in the Old Testament the divine power is
      particularly emphasized by the fact that God is the author of life: “The
      Lord kills, and brings to life” (1 Sm 2:6); “1 will kill, and bring to
      life again” (Dt 32:39). Now just as the Father has this power, so also
      does the Son; hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >For just as the Father raises the dead and grants life, so the Son
        grants life to those to whom he wishes.</span
      >
      As if to say: These are those greater works that the Father will show the
      Son, that is, he will give life to the dead. Such works are obviously
      greater, for it is greater to raise the dead than for a sick man to become
      well. Thus
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Son grants life to those to whom he wishes,</span
      >
      i.e., by giving initial life to the living, and by raising the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should not think that some are raised up by the Father and others by
      the Son. Rather, the same ones who are raised and vivified by the Father,
      are raised and vivified by the Son also: because just as the Father does
      all things through the Son, who is his power, so he also gives life to all
      through the Son, who is life, as he says below: “I am the way, and the
      truth, and the life” (14:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father does not raise up and give life through the Son as through an
      instrument, because then the Son would not have freedom of power. And so
      to exclude this he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Son grants life to those to whom he wishes,</span
      >
      i.e., it lies in the freedom of his power to grant life to whom he wills.
      For the Son does not will anything different than the Father wills: for
      just as they are one substance, so they have one will; hence Matthew
      (20:15) says: “Is it not lawful for me to do as I will?”
    </p>
    <p>
      762 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">The Father himself judges no one,</span>
      he gives the reason for what was said above, and indicates his own power.
      It should be remarked that there are two expositions for the present
      passages: one is given by Augustine, and the other by Hilary and
      Chrysostom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustine’s explanation is this. The Lord had said that just as the Father
      raises the dead, so also does the Son. But so that we do not think that
      this refers only to those miracles the Son performs in raising the dead to
      this life, and not to the Son’s raising to eternal life, he leads them to
      the deeper consideration of the resurrection to occur at the future
      judgment. Thus he refers explicitly to the judgment, saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">The Father himself judges no one.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another explanation by Augustine, in which the same meaning is maintained,
      is that the earlier statement,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >just as the Father raises the dead and grants life, so the Son,</span
      >
      should be referred to the resurrection of souls, which the Son causes
      inasmuch as he is the Word; but the text,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">The Father himself judges no one,</span>
      should be referred to the resurrection of bodies, which the Son causes
      inasmuch as he is the Word made flesh. For the resurrection of souls is
      accomplished through the person of the Father and of the Son; and for this
      reason he mentions the Father and Son together, saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >just as the Father raises the dead... so the Son.</span
      >
      But the resurrection of bodies is accomplished through the humanity of the
      Son, according to which he is not coeternal with the Father. Consequently,
      he attributes judgment solely to the Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      763 Note the wonderful variety of expressions. The Father is first
      presented as acting and the Son as resting, when it says: “the Son cannot
      do anything of himself, but only what he sees the Father doing” (5:19);
      but here, on the contrary, the Son is presented as acting and the Father
      as resting:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >The Father himself judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the
        Son.</span
      >
      We can see from this that he is speaking from different points of view at
      different times. At first, he was speaking of an action which belongs to
      the Father and the Son; thus he says that “the Son cannot do anything of
      himself, but only what he sees the Father doing”; but here he is speaking
      of an action by which the Son, as man, judges, and the Father does not:
      thus he says that the Father
      <span style="font-weight: bold">has given all judgment to the Son.</span>
      For the Father will not appear at the judgment because, in accord with
      what is just, God cannot appear in his divine nature before all who are to
      be judged: for since our happiness consists in the vision of God, if the
      wicked were to see God in his own nature, they would be enjoying
      happiness. Therefore, only the Son will appear, who alone has an assumed
      nature. Therefore, he alone will judge who alone will appear to all. Yet
      he will judge with the authority of the Father: “He is the one appointed
      by God to be the judge of the living and of the dead” (Acts 10:42); and in
      the Psalm (71:1) we read: “O Lord, give your judgment to the king.”
    </p>
    <p>
      764 Then when he says, so
      <span style="font-weight: bold">that all men may honor the Son,</span> he
      gives the effect which results from the power of the Son. First, he gives
      the effect. Secondly, he excludes an objection (v 23b).
    </p>
    <p>
      765 He says that the Father has given all judgment to the Son, according
      to his human nature, because in the incarnation the Son emptied himself,
      taking the form of a servant, under which form he was dishonored by men,
      as is said below (8:49): “I honor my Father, and you have dishonored me.”
      Therefore, judgment was given to the Son in his assumed nature in order
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >that all men may honor the Son as they honor the Father.</span
      >
      For on that day “they will see the Son of Man coming with great power and
      glory” (Lk 21:27); “They fell on their faces and worshipped, saying:
      ‘Blessing and glory, and wisdom and thanks, and honor, power and strength,
      to our God’” (Rv 7:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      766 Someone might say: I am willing to honor the Father, but do not care
      about the Son. This cannot be, because
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent
        him.</span
      >
      For it is one thing to honor God precisely as God, and another to honor
      the Father. For someone may well honor God as the omnipotent and immutable
      Creator without honoring the Son. But no one can honor God as Father
      without honoring the Son; for he cannot be called Father if he does not
      have a Son. But if you dishonor the Son by diminishing his power, this
      also dishonors the Father; because where you give less to the Son, you are
      taking away from the power of the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      767 Another explanation, given by Augustine, is this. A twofold honor is
      due to Christ. One, according to his divinity, in regard to which he is
      owed an honor equal to that given the Father; and with respect to this he
      says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >that all men may honor the Son as they honor the Father.</span
      >
      Another honor is due the Son according to his humanity, but not one equal
      to that given the Father; and with respect to this he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent
        him.</span
      >
      Thus in the first case he significantly used “as”; but now, the second
      time, he does not say “as,” but states absolutely that the Son should be
      honored: “He who rejects you, rejects me; and he who rejects me, rejects
      <span style="font-weight: bold">him who</span> sent me,” as we read in
      Luke (10:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      768 Hilary and Chrysostom give a more literal explanation, but it is only
      slightly different. They explain it this way. Our Lord said above,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Son grants life to those to whom he wishes.</span
      >
      Now whoever does anything according to the free decision of his will acts
      because of his own judgment. But it was stated above that “whatever the
      Father does, the Son does likewise” (5:19). Therefore, the Son enjoys a
      free decision of his own will in all things, since he acts because of his
      own judgment. Thus he immediately mentions judgment, saying that
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the Father himself judges no one,</span>
      i.e., without or apart from the Son. Our Lord used this way of speaking
      below (12:47): “I do not judge him,” i.e., I alone, “but the word that I
      have spoken will judge him on the last day.”
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >But he has given all judgment to the Son,</span
      >
      as he has given all things to him. For as he has given him life and
      begotten him as living, so he has given him all judgment, i.e., begotten
      him as judge: “I judge only as I hear it” (below 5:30), i.e., just as I
      have being (<i>esse</i>) from the Father, so also judgment. The reason for
      this is that the Son is nothing other than the conception of the paternal
      wisdom, as was said. But each one judges by the concept of his wisdom.
      Hence, just as the Father does all things through the Son, so he judges
      all things through him. And the fruit of this is
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >that all men may honor the Son as they honor the Father,</span
      >
      i.e., that they may render to him the cult of “latria” as they do the
      Father. The rest does not change.
    </p>
    <p>
      769 Hilary calls our attention to the remarkable relationship of the
      passages so that the errors concerning eternal generation can be refuted.
      Two heresies have arisen concerning this eternal generation. One was that
      of Arius, who said that the Son is less than the Father; and this is
      contrary to their equality and unity. The other was that of Sabellius, who
      said that that there is no distinction of persons in the divinity; and
      this is contrary to their origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, whenever he mentions the unity and equality [of the Father and Son],
      he immediately also adds their distinction as persons according to origin,
      and conversely. Thus, because he mentions the origin of the persons when
      he says, “the Son cannot do anything of himself, but only what he sees the
      Father doing” (5:19), then, so we do not think this involves inequality,
      he at once adds: “for whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.”
      Conversely, when he states their equality by saying:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >For just as the Father raises the dead and grants life, so the Son
        grants life to those to whom he wishes,</span
      >
      then, so that we do not deny that the Son has an origin and is begotten,
      he adds,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Father himself judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the
        Son.</span
      >
      Similarly, when he mentions the equality of the persons by saying.
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >so that all men may honor the Son as they honor the Father.</span
      >
      he immediately adds something about a “mission,” which indicates an
      origin, saying:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent
        him,</span
      >
      but not in such a way that involves a separation. Christ mentions such
      mission below (8:29) in saying: “He who sent me is with me, and he has not
      left me alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      770 Above, our Lord showed that he had life-giving power; here he shows
      how someone can share in this life coming from him. First, he tells how
      one can share in this life through him. Secondly, he predicts its
      fulfillment (v 25).
    </p>
    <p>
      771 With respect to the first, we should point out that there are four
      grades of life. One is found in plants, which take nourishment, grow,
      reproduce, and are reproduced. Another is in animals which only sense.
      Another in living things that move, that is, the perfect animals. Finally,
      there is another form of life which is present in those who understand.
      Now among those grades of life that exist, it is impossible that the
      foremost life be that found in plants, or in those with sensation, or even
      in those with motion. For the first and foremost life must be that which
      is <i>per se,</i> not that which is participated. This can be none other
      than intellectual life, for the other three forms are common to a corporal
      and spiritual creature [as man]. Indeed, a body that lives is not life
      itself, but one participating in life. Hence intellectual life is the
      first and foremost life, which is the spiritual life, that is immediately
      received from the first principle of life, whence it is called the life of
      wisdom. For this reason in the Scriptures life is attributed to wisdom:
      “He who finds me finds life, and has salvation from the Lord” (Prv 8:35).
      Therefore we share life from Christ, who is the Wisdom of God, insofar as
      our soul receives wisdom from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this intellectual life is made perfect by the true knowledge of divine
      Wisdom, which is eternal life: “This is eternal life: that they may know
      you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent” (below
      17:3). But no one can arrive at any wisdom except by faith. Hence it is
      that in the sciences, no one acquires wisdom unless he first believes what
      is said by his teacher. Therefore, if we wish to acquire this life of
      wisdom, we must believe through faith the things that are proposed to us
      by it. “He who comes to God must believe that he is and rewards those who
      seek him” (Heb 11:6); “If you do not believe, you will not understand,” as
      we read in another version of Isaiah (28:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      772 Thus, our Lord fittingly shows that the way of obtaining life is
      through faith, saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >whoever hears my voice and believes in him who sent me, possesses
        eternal life.</span
      >
      First, he mentions the merit of faith. Secondly, the reward of’ faith,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">eternal life.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      773 Concerning the merit of faith, he first indicates how faith is brought
      to us; and secondly, the foundation of faith, that on which it rests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith comes to us through the words of men: “Faith comes through hearing,
      and hearing through the word of Christ” (Rom 10:17). But faith does not
      rest on man’s word, but on God himself: “Abram believed God, who counted
      this as his justification” (Gn 15:6); “You who fear the Lord, believe in
      him” (Sir 2:8). Thus we are lead to believe through the words of men, not
      in the man himself who speaks, but in God, whose words he speaks: “When
      you heard the word we brought you as God’s word, you did not receive it as
      the word of men, but, as what it really is, the word of God” (1 Thes
      2:13). Our Lord mentions these two things. First, how faith is brought to
      us, when he says, whoever hears my voice [literally, word], which leads to
      faith. Secondly, he mentions that on which faith rests, saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and believes in him who sent me,</span>
      i.e., not in me, but in him in virtue of whom I speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      This text can apply to Christ, as man, insofar as it is through Christ’s
      human words that men were converted to the faith. And it can apply to
      Christ, as God, insofar as Christ is the Word of God. For since Christ is
      the Word of God, it is clear that those who heard Christ were hearing the
      Word of God, and as a consequence, were believing in God. And this is what
      he says: whoever hears my word, i.e., me, the Word of God, and believes in
      him, i.e., the Father, whose Word I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      774 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">possesses eternal life,</span> he mentions
      the reward of faith, and states three things we will possess in the state
      of glory; but they are mentioned in reverse order. First, there will be
      the resurrection from the dead. Secondly, we will have freedom from the
      future judgment. Thirdly, we will enjoy everlasting life, for as we read
      in Matthew (c 25), the just will enter into everlasting life. He mentions
      these three as belonging to the reward of faith; and the third was
      mentioned first since it is desired more than the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      775 So he says, whoever believes, i.e., through faith,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">possesses eternal life,</span> which
      consists in the full vision of God. And it is fitting that one who
      believes on account of God certain things that he does not see, should be
      brought to the full vision of these things: “These things are written that
      you may believe... and that believing you may have life in his name”
      (below 20:31).
    </p>
    <p>
      776 He mentions the second when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and he will not encounter judgment.</span>
      But the Apostle says something which contradicts this: “We must all appear
      before the judgment seat of Christ” (2 Cor 5:10), even the apostles.
      Therefore, even one who does believe will encounter judgment. I answer
      that there are two kinds of judgment. One is a judgment of condemnation,
      and no one encounters that judgment if he believes in God with a faith
      that is united with love [ a “formed faith”]. We read about this judgment:
      “Do not enter into judgment with your servant, for no living man is just
      in your sight”; and it was said above (3:18): “Whoever believes is not
      judged.” There is also a judgment of separation and examination; and, as
      the Apostle says, all must present themselves before the tribunal of
      Christ for this judgment. Of this judgment we read: “Judge me, O God, and
      distinguish my cause from those people who are not holy” (Ps 42:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      777 Thirdly, he mentions a reward when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">but has passed from death to life,</span>
      or “will pass,” as another version says. This statement can be explained
      in two ways. First, it can refer to the resurrection of the soul. In this
      case the obvious meaning is that he is saying: Through faith we attain not
      only to eternal life and freedom from judgment, but also to the
      forgiveness of our sins as well. Hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">but has passed,</span> from unbelief to
      belief, from injustice to justice: “We know that we have passed from death
      to life” (1 Jn 3:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, this statement can be explained as referring to the resurrection
      of the body. Then it is an elaboration of the phrase,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">possesses eternal life</span>. For some
      might think from what was said, that whoever believes in God will never
      die, but live forever. But this is impossible, because all men must pay
      the debt incurred by the. first sin, according to: “Where is the man who
      lives, and will not see death?” (Ps 88:49). Consequently, we should not
      think that one who believes has eternal life in such a way as never to
      die; rather, he will pass from thi’s life, through death, to life, i.e.,
      through the death of the body he will be revived to eternal life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, “will pass,” might refer to the cause [of one’s resurrection] for when
      a person believes, he already has the merit for a glorious resurrection:
      “Your dead will live, your slain will rise” (Is 26:19). And then, once
      released from the death of the old man, we will receive the life of the
      new man, that is, Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      778
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Amen, amen, I say to you...</span> Since
      some might doubt if any would pass from death to life, our Lord predicts
      that this will happen, saying: I say that he [who believes] “will pass
      from death to life”; and I say it before it actually occurs. And this is
      what he states, saying:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Amen, amen, I say to you, the hour is coming,</span
      >
      not determined by a necessity of fate, but by God’s decree: “It is the
      last hour” (1 Jn 2:18). And so that we do not think that it is far off, he
      adds, <span style="font-weight: bold">and is now here</span> “it is now
      the time for us to rise froin sleep” (Rom 13:11)—i.e., the hour is now
      here
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who
        hear it will live.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      779 This can be explained in two ways. In one way as referring to the
      resurrection of the body, and so it is said that
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the hour is coming, and is now here,</span
      >
      as if he had said: It is true that eventually all will rise, but even now
      is the hour when some, whom the Lord was about to resuscitate,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >shall hear the voice of the Son of God.</span
      >
      This is the way Lazarus heard it when it was said to him, “Come forth,” as
      we read below (11:43); and in this way the daughter of the leader of the
      synagogue heard it (Mt 9:18); and the widow’s son (Lk 7:12). Therefore, he
      says significantly,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and is now here,</span> because through me
      the dead already are beginning to be raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another explanation is given by Augustine, according to which
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and is now here</span> refers to the
      resurrection of the soul. For as was said above, resurrection is of two
      kinds: the resurrection of bodies, which will happen in the future; this
      does not take place now, but will occur at the future judgment. The other
      is the resurrection of souls from the death of unbelief to the life of
      faith, and from the life of injustice to that of justice; and this is now
      here. Hence he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead,</span
      >
      i.e., unbelievers and sinners,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear it will
        live,</span
      >
      according to the true faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      780 This passage seems to imply two strange occurrences. One, when he says
      that the dead will hear. The other, when he adds that it is through
      hearing that they will come to life again, as though hearing comes before
      life, whereas hearing is a certain function of life. However, if we refer
      this to the resurrection, it is true that the dead will hear, i.e., obey
      the voice of the Son of God. For the voice expresses the interior concept.
      Now all nature obeys the slightest command of the divine will: “He calls
      into existence what does not exist” (Rom 4:17). According to this, then,
      wood, stones, all things, not just the dry bones but also the dust of dead
      bodies,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >shall hear the voice of the Son of God</span
      >
      so far as they obey his slightest will. And this belongs to Christ, not
      insofar as he is the Son of Man, but insofar as he is the Son of God,
      because all things obey the Word of God. And so he significantly says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">of the Son of God;</span> “What kind of
      man is this, for the sea and winds obey him?” (Mt 8:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      If this statement (25b) is understood as referring to the resurrection of
      souls, then the reason for it is this: the voice of the Son of God has a
      life-giving power, that voice by which he moves the hearts of the faithful
      interiorly by inspiration, or exteriorly by his preaching and that of
      others: “The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life” (below
      6:64). And so he gives life to the dead when he justifies the wicked. And
      since hearing is the way to life, either of nature through obedience,
      namely, by repairing nature, or the hearing of faith by repairing life and
      justice, he therefore says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and those who hear it,</span> by obedience
      as to the resurrection of the body, or by faith as to the resurrection of
      souls, will live, in the body in eternal life, and injustice in the life
      of grace.

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        26 “Indeed, just as the Father possesses life in himself, so he has
        given it to the Son to have life in himself. 27 And he [the Father] gave
        him the power to pass judgment, because he is the Son of Man. 28 Do not
        be surprised at this, since the hour is coming when all those burried in
        tombs will hear the voice of the Son of God. 29 And those who have done
        well will come forth to a resurrection of life; those who have done evil
        will come forth to a resurrection of judgment [i.e., condemnation]. 30 I
        cannot do anything of myself, but I judge only as I hear it; and my
        judgment is just, because I am not seeking my own will, but the will of
        him who sent me.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      781 Above, our Lord showed that he had the power to give life and to
      judge; and he explained each by its effect. Here he shows how each of
      these powers belongs to him. First, he shows this with respect to his
      life-giving power. Secondly, with respect to his power to judge (v 27).
    </p>
    <p>
      782 So he says, first: I say that as the Father raises the dead, so I do
      also; and anyone who hears my word has eternal life. And I possess this
      because,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >just as the Father possesses life in himself, so he has given it to the
        Son to have life in himself.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Apropos of this, we should note that some who live do not have life in
      themselves: as Paul, “I am living by faith in the Son of God” (Gal 2:20);
      and again in the same place: “it is not I who now live, but Christ lives
      in me.” Thus he lived, yet not in himself, but in another through whom he
      lived: as a body lives, although it does not have life in itself, but in a
      soul through which it lives. So that has life in itself which has an
      essential, non-participated life, i.e., that which is itself life. Now in
      every genus of things, that which is something through its essence is the
      cause of those things that are it by participation, as fire is the cause
      of all things afire. And so, that which is life through its essence, is
      the cause and principle of all life in living things. Accordingly, if
      something is to be a principle of life, it must be life through its
      essence. And so our Lord fittingly shows that he is the principle of all
      life by saying that he has life in himself, i.e., through his essence,
      when he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >just as the Father possesses life in himself,</span
      >
      i.e., as he is living through his essence, so does the Son. Therefore, as
      the Father is the cause of life, so also is his Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, he shows the equality of the Son to the Father when he says, as
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Father possesses life in himself;</span
      >
      and he shows their distinction when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">he has given it to the Son</span>. For the
      Father and the Son are equal in life; but they are distinct, because the
      Father gives, and the Son receives. However, we should not understand this
      to mean that the Son receives life from the Father as if the Son first
      existed without having life, as in lower things a first matter, already
      existing, receives a form, and as a subject receives accidents: because in
      the Son there is nothing that exists prior to the reception of life. For
      as Hilary says: “the Son has nothing unless it is begotten,” i.e., nothing
      but what he receives through his birth. And since the Father is life
      itself, the meaning of,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >he has given it to the Son to have life in himself,</span
      >
      is that the Father produced the Son as living. As if one were to say: the
      mind gives life to the word, not as though the word existed and then
      receives life, but because the mind produces the word in the same life by
      which it lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      783 According to Hilary, this passage destroys three heresies. First, that
      of the Arians, who said that the Son is inferior to the Father. They were
      forced by what was stated earlier, that is, “For whatever the Father does,
      the Son does likewise” (5:19), to say that the Son is equal to the Father
      in power; but they still denied that the Son is equal to the Father in
      nature. But now, this too is refuted by this statement, namely,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >just as the Father possesses life in himself, so he has given it to the
        Son to have life in himself.</span
      >
      For since life pertains to the nature, if the Son has life in himself as
      does the Father, it is clear that he has in himself, by his very origin, a
      nature indivisible froin and equal to that ofthe Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second error is also Arian: their denial that the Son is coeternal
      with the Father, when they say that the Son began to exist in time. This
      is destroyed when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the Son has life in himself.</span> For in
      all living things whose generation occurs in time, it is always possible
      to find something that at some time or other was not living. But in the
      Son, whatever is, is life itself. Consequently, he so received life itself
      that he has life in himself, so as always to have been living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, by saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">he has given,</span> he destroys the error
      of Sabellius, who denied the distinction of persons. For if the Father
      gave life to the Son, it is obvious that the Father, who gave it, is other
      than the Son, who received it.
    </p>
    <p>
      784 Then (v 27), he makes it clear that he has the power to judge. First,
      he reveals his judiciary power. Secondly, he gives a reason for what he
      has said (v 30). As to the first he does two things. First, he indicates
      the origin of his judiciary power. Secondly, he shows that his judgment is
      just (v 29).
    </p>
    <p>
      785 With regard to the first, we should note that his statement,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">he [the Father] gave him the power,</span>
      can be understood in two ways. One way is that of Augustine; the other is
      that of Chrysostom.
    </p>
    <p>
      786 If we understand it as Chrysostom does, then this section is divided
      into two parts. First, he reveals the origin of his judiciary power.
      Secondly, he settles a difficulty (v 27b).
    </p>
    <p>
      Chrysostom punctuates this section in the following way.
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >He gave him the power to pass judgment.</span
      >
      And then a new sentence begins:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Because he is the Son of Man, do not be surprised at this.</span
      >
      The reason for this punctuation is that Paul of Samosata, an early
      heretic, who like Photius said that Christ was only a man and took his
      origin from the Virgin, punctuated it as:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >He gave him the power to pass judghnent because he is the Son of
        Man.</span
      >
      And then he began a new sentence:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Do not be surprised at this, since the hour is coming.</span
      >
      It was as if he thought that it was necessary for judiciary power to be
      given to Christ because he is the Son of Man, that is, a mere man, who, of
      himself, cannot judge men. And so, if Christ is to judge others, he must
      be given the power to judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this, according to Chrysostom, cannot stand, because it is not at all
      in agreement with what is stated. For if it is because he is a man that he
      receives judiciary power, then for the same reason, since it would belong
      to every man to have judiciary power in virtue of his human nature, it
      would not belong to Christ any more than to other men. So we should not
      understand it this way. Rather, we should say that because Christ is the
      ineffable Son of God, he is on that account also judge. And this is what
      he says: The Father not only give him the power to give life, but
      <span style="font-weight: bold">also he gave him the power,</span> through
      eternal
      <span style="font-weight: bold">generation, to pass judgment,</span> just
      as he gave him, through eternal generation, to have life in himself: “He
      is the one appointed by God to be the judge of the living and of the
      dead,” as we read in Acts (10:42).
    </p>
    <p>
      He settles a difficulty when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Do not be surprised at this.</span> First,
      he mentions the difficulty. Secondly, he clears it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      787 The difficulty arose in the minds of the Jews and they were surprised
      because while they thought that Christ was no more than a man, he was
      saying things about himself that surpassed man and even the angels. So he
      says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Do not be surprised at this,</span> that
      is, that I have said that the Son gives life to the dead and has the power
      to judge precisely
      <span style="font-weight: bold">because he is the Son of Man.</span> They
      were surprised because, although they thought he was only a man, they saw
      that he accomplished divine effects: “What kind of man is this, for the
      sea and winds obey him?” (Mt 8:27). And he gives a reason why they should
      not be surprised, which is, because he who is the Son of Man is the Son of
      God. Although, as Chrysostom says, is it not said explicitly that the Son
      of Man is the Son of God, our Lord lays down the premises from which this
      statement necessarily follows: just as we notice that those who use
      syllogisms in their teaching do not express their main conclusion, but
      only that from which it follows with necessity. So our Lord does not say
      that he is the Son of God, but that the Son of Man is such that at his
      voice all the dead will rise. From this it necessarily follows that he is
      the Son of God: for it is a proper effect of God to raise the dead. Thus
      he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Do not be surprised at this, since the hour is coming when all those
        burried in tombs will hear the voice of the Son of God.</span
      >
      But he does not say of this hour, as he said above, “and is now here”
      (5:25). Again, here he says, all, which he did not say above: because at
      the first resurrection he raised only some, as Lazarus, the widow’s son
      and the young girl; but at the future resurrection, at the time of
      judgment,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >all will hear the voice of the Son of God,</span
      >
      and will rise. “I will open your graves, and lead you out of your tombs”
      (Ez 37:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      788 Augustine punctuates this passage in the following way.
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >And he gave him the power to pass judgment because he is the Son of
        Man.</span
      >
      And then a new sentence follows:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Do not be surprised at this.</span> In
      this interpretation there are two parts. The first concerns the power to
      judge granted to the Son of Man. In the second, the granting of an even
      greater power is made clear, at
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Do not be surprised at this.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      789 As to the first we should note that, according to the mind of
      Augustine, he spoke above of the resurrection of souls, which is
      accomplished through the Son of God, but here he is speaking of the
      resurrection of bodies, which is accomplished through the Son of Man. And
      because the general resurrection of bodies will take place at the time of
      judgment, he mentions the judgment first, in saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">And he [the Father] gave him,</span> i.e.,
      Christ,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">the power to pass Judgment,</span> and
      this,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">because he is the Son of Man,</span> i.e.,
      according to his human nature. Thus it is also after the resurrection that
      he says in Matthew (28:18): “All power has been given to me, in heaven and
      on earth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three reasons why judiciary power has been given to Christ as
      man. First, in order that he might be seen by all: for it is necessary
      that a judge be seen by all who are to be judged. Now both the good and
      the wicked will be judged. And the good will see Christ in his divinity
      and in his humanity; while the wicked will not be able to see him in his
      divinity, because this vision is the happiness of the saints and is
      seedonly by the pure in heart: “Happy are the pure in heart, for they will
      see God” (Mt 5:8). And so, in order that Christ can be seen at the
      judgment not only by the good, but also by the wicked, he will judge in
      human form: “Every eye will see him, and all who pierced him” (Rv 1:7).
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, the power to judge was given to Christ as man because by the
      self-abasement of his passion he merited the glory of an exaltation. Thus,
      just as he who died arose, so that [human] form which was judged, will
      judge, and he who stood before a human judge will preside at the judgment
      of men. He who was falsely found guilty will condemn the truly guilty, as
      Augustine remarks in his work, <i>The Sayings of the Lord.</i> “Your cause
      has been judged as that of the wicked; but cause and judgment you will
      recover” (Jb 3 6.17).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, Christas man was given judiciary power to suggest the compassion
      of the judge. For it is very terrifying for a man to be judged by God: “It
      is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God” (Heb 10:31);
      but it produces confidence for a man to have another man as his judge.
      Accordingly, so you can experience the compassion of your judge, you will
      have a man as judge: “We do not have a high priest who cannot have
      compassion on our weakness” (Heb 4:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, <span style="font-weight: bold">he gave him</span>, Christ,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the power to pass judgment because he is the Son of Man.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      790
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Do not be surprised at this,</span> for he
      has given him a greater power, that is, the power to raise the dead. Thus
      he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">since the hour is coming,</span> that is,
      the last hour at the end of the world: “The time has come, the day of
      slaughter is near” (Ez 7:7),
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >when all those burried in tombs will hear the voice of the Son of
        God.</span
      >
      Above he did not say “all,” because there he was speaking of the spiritual
      resurrection, in which all did not rise at his first coming, for we read:
      “All do not have faith” (2 Thes 3:2). But here he is speaking of the
      resurrection of the body, and all will rise in this way, as we read in 1
      Corinthians (15:20). He adds,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">those burried in tombs,</span> which he
      had not mentioned above, because only bodies, not souls, are in tombs, and
      it is the resurrection of bodies that will then take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >All those burried in tombs will hear the voice of the Son of God.</span
      >
      This voice will be a sense perceptible sign of the Son of God, at whose
      sound all will be raised: “The Lord will come with the cry of the
      archangel and with the trumpet of God” (1 Thes 4:15); we find the same in
      1 Corinthians (15:52) and in Matthew (25:6): “There was a cry at
      midnight.” This voice will derive its power from the divinity of Christ:
      “He will make his voice a powerful voice,” as the Psalm (67:34) says.
    </p>
    <p>
      791 As we saw, Augustine says that the resurrection of the body will be
      accomplished through the Word made flesh, but the resurrection of the soul
      is accomplished through the Word. One may wonder how to understand this:
      whether we are talking about a first cause or a meritorious cause. If we
      are referring to a first cause, then it is clear that the divinity of
      Christ is the cause of the corporal and spiritual resurrection, i.e., of
      the resurrection of bodies and of souls, according to: “I will kill, and I
      will bring to life again” (Dt 32:39). But if we are referring to a
      meritorious cause, then it is the humanity of Christ which is the cause of
      both resurrections: because through the mysteries accomplished in the
      flesh of Christ we are restored not only to an incorruptible life in our
      bodies, but also to a spiritual life in our souls: “He was put to death on
      account of our sins, and he rose for our justification” (Rom 4:25).
      Accordingly, what Augustine says does not seem to be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      I answer that Augustine is speaking of the exemplary cause and of that
      cause by which that which is brought to life is made conformable to that
      which brings it to life: for everything that lives through another is
      conformed to that through which it lives. Now the resurrection of souls
      does not consist in souls being conformed to the humanity of Christ, but
      to the Word, because the life of the soul is through the Word alone; and
      so he says that the resurrection of souls takes place through the Word.
      But the resurrection of the body will consist in our bodies being
      conformed to the body of Christ through the life of glory, that is,
      through the glory of our bodies, according to: “He will change our lowly
      body so it is like his glorious body” (Phil 3:2 1). And it is from this
      point of view that he says that the resurrection of the body will take
      place through the Word made flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      792 Then (v 29), he shows the justness of his judgment: because the good
      will be rewarded, and so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >And those who have done well will come forth to a resurrection of
        life,</span
      >
      i.e., to living in eternal glory; but the wicked will be damned, and so he
      says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >those who have done evil will come forth to a resurrection of judgment
        [i.e., condemnation],</span
      >
      i.e., they will rise for condemnation: “These,” the wicked, “will go into
      everlasting punishment; but the just will go to eternal life” (Mt 25:46);
      “Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to an
      everlasting life, and others to everlasting shame” (Dn 12:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      793 Note than when he was speaking above of the resurrection of souls, he
      said, “those who hear it,” the voice of the Son of God, “will live”
      (5:25); but here he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">will come forth.</span> He says this
      because of the wicked, who will be condemned: for their life should not be
      called a life, but rather an eternal death. Again, above he mentioned only
      faith, saying, “Whoever hears my voice and believes in him who sent me,
      possesses eternal life; and he will not encounter judgment” (5:24). But
      here he mentions works, so that we do not think that faith alone, without
      works, is sufficient for salvation, saying:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >And those who have done well will come forth to a resurrection of
        life.</span
      >
      As if to say:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Those will come forth to a resurrection of life</span
      >
      who do not just believe, but who have accomplished good works along with
      their faith: “Faith without works is dead,” as we see from James (2:26).
    </p>
    <p>
      794 Then when he says, I cannot do anything of myself, he gives the reason
      for what he has just said. Now he had spoken of two things: the origin of
      his power, and the justness of his judgment. Consequently, he mentions the
      reason for each.
    </p>
    <p>
      795 The first point, when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I cannot do anything of myself,</span> can
      be understood in two ways, even according to Augustine. First, as
      referring to the Son of Man in this manner: You say that you have the
      power to raise the dead because you are the Son of Man. But do you have
      this power precisely because you are the Son of Man? No, because
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >I cannot do anything of myself, but I judge only as I hear it.</span
      >
      He does not say, “as I see,” as he said above; “The Son cannot do anything
      of himself, but only what he sees the Father doing” (5:19). But he does
      say, <span style="font-weight: bold">as I hear it:</span> for in this
      context “to hear” is the same as “to obey.” Now to obey belongs to one who
      receives a command, while to command pertains to one who is superior.
      Accordingly, because Christ, as man, is inferior to the Father, he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">as I hear it,</span> i.e., as infused into
      my soul by God. We read of this kind of hearing in Psalm 84 (v 9): “1 will
      hear what the Lord God says in me.” But above he said “sees,” because he
      was then speaking of himself as the Word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      796 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and my judgment is just,</span> he shows
      the justness of his judgment. For he had said: “Those who have done well
      will come forth to a resurrection of life.” But some might say: Will he be
      partial and uneven when he punishes and rewards? So he answers: No,
      saying: <span style="font-weight: bold">my judgment is just;</span> and
      the reason is
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >because I am not seeking my own will, but the will of him who sent
        me.</span
      >
      For there are two wills in our Lord Jesus Christ: one is a divine will,
      which is the same as the will of the Father; the other is a human will,
      which is proper to himself, just as it is proper to him to be a man. A
      human will is borne to its own good; but in Christ it was ruled and
      regulated by right reason, so that it would always be conformed in all
      things to the divine will. Accordingly he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I am not seeking my own will,</span> which
      as such is inclined to its own good,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">but the will of him who sent me,</span>
      that is, the Father: “I have desired to do your will, my God” (Ps 39:9);
      “Not as I will, but as you will” (Mt 26:39).
    </p>
    <p>
      If this is carefully considered, the Lord is assigning the true nature of
      a just judgment, saying:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >because I am not seeking my own will.</span
      >
      For one’s judgment is just when it is passed according to the norm of law.
      But the divine will is the norm and the law of the created will. And so,
      the created will, and the reason, which is regulated according to the norm
      of the divine will, is just, and its judgment is just.
    </p>
    <p>
      797 Secondly, it is explained as referring to the Son of God; and then the
      aforesaid division still remains the same. Thus Christ, as the Divine Word
      showing the origin of his power, says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I cannot do anything of myself,</span> in
      the way he said above, “the Son cannot do anything of himself” (5:19). For
      his very doing and his power are his being (<i>esse</i>); but being
      (<i>esse</i>) in him is from another, that is, from his Father. And so,
      just as he is not of himself (a <i>se</i>), so of himself he cannot do
      anything: “I do nothing of myself” (below 8:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      His statement,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I judge only as I hear it,</span> is
      explained as his previous statement, “only what he sees the Father doing”
      (above 5:19). For we acquire science or any knowledge through sight and
      hearing (for these two senses are those most used in learning). But
      because sight and hearing are different is us, we acquire knowledge in one
      way through sight, that is, by discovering things, and in a different way
      through hearing, that is, by being taught. But in the Son of God, sight
      and hearing are the same; thus, when he says either “sees” or “hears,” the
      meaning is the same so far as the acquisition of knowledge is concerned.
      And because judgment in any intelletual nature comes from knowledge, he
      says significantly,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I judge only as I hear it,</span> i.e., as
      I have acquired knowledge together with heing from the Father, so I judge:
      “Everything I have heard from my Father I have made known to you” (below
      15:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      798 Showing the justness of his judgment he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and my judgment is just:</span> the reason
      being,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">because I am not seeking my own will</span
      >. But do not the Father and the Son have the same will? I answer that the
      Father and the Son do have the same will, but the Father does not have his
      will from another, whereas the Son does have his will from another, i.e.,
      from the Father. Thus the Son accomplishes his own will as from another,
      i.e., as having it from another; but the Father accomplishes his will as
      his own, i.e., not having it from another. Thus he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I am not seeking my own will</span>, that
      is, such as would be mine if it originated from myself, but my will, as
      being from another, that is from the Father.

    <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      <span style="font-weight: bold">LECTURE 6</span>

      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      799 Having given us the teaching on the life-giving power of the Son, he
      now confirms it. First, he confirms, with several testimonies, what he had
      said about the excellence of his power. In the second place, he reproves
      them because of their slowness to believe (v 41). He does two things about
      the first. First, he states why there was a need to resort to such
      testimonies. Secondly, he invokes the testimonies (v 32).
    </p>
    <p>
      800 The need to appeal to testimony arose because the Jews did not believe
      in him; for this reason he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >If I were to bear witness to myself, my testimony would not be
        valid</span
      >
      (<i>verum</i>, valid, true). Some may find this statement puzzling: for if
      our Lord says of himself, “I am the truth” (below 14:6), how can his
      testimony not be valid? If he is the truth, in whom shall one believe if
      the truth itself is not believed in? We may answer, according to
      Chrysostom, that our Lord is speaking here of himself from the point of
      view of the opinion of others, so that his meaning is:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >If I were to bear witness to myself, my testimony would not be
        valid</span
      >
      so far as your outlook is concerned, because you do not accept what I say
      about myself unless it is confirmed by other testimony: “You are bearing
      witness to yourself; your testimony is not valid” (below 8:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      801 Next, he presents these testimonies: first, a human testimony;
      secondly, a divine testimony. He does two things about the first. First,
      he mentions the testimony of John; secondly, he tells why this testimony
      was given (v 34). With respect to the first he does two things. First, he
      brings in the testimony; secondly, he commends it (v 32).
    </p>
    <p>
      802 He brings on the witness when he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >But there is someone else who testifies on my behalf.</span
      >
      This is, in the opinion of Chrysostom, John the Baptist, of whom we read
      above: “There was a man sent by God, whose name was John. He came as a
      witness, that he might bear witness to the light” (1:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      803 He commends John’s testimony on two grounds: first, because of its
      truth; secondly, because of its authority, for the Jews had sought it (v
      33).
    </p>
    <p>
      804 He commends his testimony because of its truth, saying:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">And I know,</span> from certain
      experience, that the witness he, that is, John,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">bears on my behalf is true.</span> His
      father, Zechariah, had prophesied this of him: “You will go before the
      face of the Lord to prepare his way, to give his people a knowledge of
      salvation” (Lk 1:76). Now it is obvious that false testimony is not a
      testimony that saves, because lying is a cause of death: “A lying mouth
      kills the soul” (Wis 1:11). Therefore, if John’s testimony was for the
      purpose of giving knowledge of salvation to his people, his testimony is
      true.
    </p>
    <p>
      805 The Gloss has a different explanation of this:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >If I were to bear witness to myself, my testimony would not be
        valid.</span
      >
      For above, Christ was referring to himself as God, but here he is
      referring to himself as a man. And the meaning is: If I, namely, a man,
      were to bear witness to myself, i.e., apart from God, that is, which God
      the Father does not certify, then it follows that
      <span style="font-weight: bold">my testimony would not be valid,</span>
      for human speech has no truth unless it is supported by God, according to:
      “God is true, but every man is a liar” (Rom 3:4). Thus, if we take Christ
      as a man separated from the Deity and not in conformity with it, we find a
      lie both in his essence and in his words: “Although I bear witness to
      myself, my testimony is true” (below 8:14); “I am not alone, because the
      Father is with me” (below 16:32). And so, because he was not alone but
      with the Father, his testimony is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, to show that his testimony is true, not in virute of his
      humanity considered in itself, but in so far as it is united to his
      divinity and to the Word of God, he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >But there is someone else who testifies on my behalf</span
      >: not John, but the Father, according to this explanation. Because if the
      testimony of Christ as man is not of itself true and productive, much less
      is the testimony of John. Therefore, the testimony of Christ is not
      verified by the testimony of John, but by the testimony of the Father. So
      this someone else who testifies is understood to be the Father.
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >And I know that the witness he bears on my behalf is true</span
      >, for he is truth: “God is light, “‘ i.e., truth, “and in him there is no
      darkness,” i.e., lie (1 Jn 1:5).
    </p>
    <p>
      The first explanation, which is that given by Chrysostom, is nearer to the
      letter of the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      806 He also commends the testimony of John by reason of its authority,
      because it was sought after by the Jews, saying:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">You sent [messengers] to John.</span> As
      if to say: I know that his testimony is true and you should not reject it,
      because the great authority John enjoyed among you led you to seek his
      testimony about me; and you would not have done this if you did not think
      that he was worthy of belief: “The Jews sent priests and Levites from
      Jerusalem to him” (above 1:19). And on this occasion, John bore witness,
      not to himself, but <span style="font-weight: bold">to the truth</span>,
      i.e., to me. As a friend of the truth, he bore testimony to the truth,
      which is Christ: “He declared openly, and did not deny, and stated
      clearly, ‘I am not the Messiah’” (above 1:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      807 Then (v 34), he gives the reason why an appeal was made to the
      testimony of John. First, he excludes a supposed reason. Next, he presents
      the true reason (v 34b).
    </p>
    <p>
      808 Someone might think that John’s testimony was brought in to assure
      them about Christ, on the ground that Christ’s own testimony was not
      sufficient. He excludes this reason when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I myself do not need proof from men</span
      >. Here we should note that sometimes in the sciences a thing is proved by
      something else which is more evident to us, but which is less evident in
      itself; and at other times a thing is proved by something else which is
      more evident in itself and absolutely. Now, in this case, the issue is to
      prove that Christ is God. And, although the truth of Christ is, in itself
      and absolutely, more evident, yet it is proved by the testimony of John,
      which was better known to the Jews. So Christ, of himself, did not have
      any need of John’s testimony; and this is what he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I myself do not need proof from men</span
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      809 But this seems to conflict with: “You are my witnesses, said the Lord”
      (Is 40:10); and with “You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all of
      Judea and Samaria, and to the remotest part of the world” (Acts 1:8). So
      how can he say:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I myself do not need proof from men</span
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be understood in two ways. In the first way, the sense is:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I myself do not need proof from men</span
      >, as relying on it alone; but I have stronger testimony, that is, divine
      testimony: “For me, it does not matter much if I am judged by you” (1 Cor
      4:3); “You know that I have not desired the day of man,” i.e., human glory
      (Jer 17:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      Another interpretation is:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I myself do not need proof from men</span
      >, insofar as the one giving witness is a man, but insofar as he is
      enlightened by God in order to testify: “There was a man sent by God,
      whose name was John” (above 1:6); “We did not seek glory from men” (1 Thes
      2:6); “1 do not seek my own glory” (below 8:50). And so I receive the
      testimony of John not just as a man, but insofar as he was sent and
      enlightened by God in order to testify.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third explanation, and a better one, is:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I myself do not need proof from men</span
      >, i.e., human testimony. As far as I am concerned, I receive my authority
      from no one but God, who proves that I am great.
    </p>
    <p>
      810 Next (v 34b), he gives the real reason for appealing to John’s
      testimony. First, he states the reason. Secondly, he explains it. The
      reason for appealing to this testimony was so that the Jews might be saved
      by believing in Christ, and this because of John’s testimony. Thus he
      says: I do not need John’s testimony for my sake,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >but I say this in order that you may be saved:</span
      >
      “He desires the salvation of’ all men” (1 Tim 2:4). “Christ came into this
      world to save sinners” (1 Tim 1:15).
    </p>
    <p>
      811 He explains his statement, in order that you may be saved: that is,
      because I am appealing to testimony you have accepted. And so he mentions
      that John was accepted by them:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >He was a lamp, blazing and burning brightly.</span
      >
      First, he states that John was a witness accepted on his own merits.
      Secondly, he mentions to what degree he was accepted by them (v 35b).
    </p>
    <p>
      812 Three things perfected John and show that he was a witness accepted in
      his own right. The first concerns the condition of his nature, and he
      refers to this when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">He was a lamp</span>. The second concerns
      the perfection of his love, because he was a
      <span style="font-weight: bold">blazing</span> lamp. The third is related
      to the perfection of his understanding, because he was a lamp that was
      <span style="font-weight: bold">burning brightly.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      John was perfect in his nature because he was a lamp, i.e., enriched by
      grace and illumined by the light of the Word of God. Now a lamp differs
      from a light: for a light radiates light of itself, but a lamp does not
      give light of itself, but by participating in the light. Now the true
      light is Christ: “He was the true light, which enlightens every man coming
      into this world” (above 1:9). John, however, was not a light, as we read
      in the same place, but a lamp, because he was enlightened “in order to
      bear witness to the light” (above 1:8), by leading men to Christ. We read
      of this lamp: “I have prepared a lamp for my anointed” (Ps 131:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, he was blazing and impassioned in his affections, so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">blazing</span>. For some people are lamps
      only as to their office or rank, but they are snuffed out in their
      affections: for as a lamp cannot give light unless there is a fire blazing
      within it, so a spiritual lamp does not give any light unless it is first
      set ablaze and burns with the fire of love. Therefore, to be ablaze comes
      first, and the giving of light depends on it, because knowledge of the
      truth is given due to the blazing of love: “If any one loves me, he will
      keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and
      make our home with him” (below 14:23); and “I have called you friends,
      because everything I have heard from my Father I have made known to you”
      (below 15:15); “You who fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts will be
      enlightened” (Sir 2:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      The two characteristics of fire are that it both blazes and shines. Its
      blazing signifies love for three reasons. First, because fire is the most
      active of all bodies; so too is the warmth of love (charity), so much so
      that nothing can withstand its force: “The love of Christ spurs us on” (2
      Cor 5:14). Secondly, because just as fire, because it is very volatile,
      causes great unrest, so also this love of charity makes a person restless
      until he achieves his objective: “Its light is fire and flame” (Sg 8:6).
      Thirdly, just as fire is inclined to move upward, so too is charity; so
      much so that it joins us to God: “He who abides in love abides in God, and
      God in him” (1Jn 4:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, John had an intellect that was
      <span style="font-weight: bold">burning brightly.</span> First, it was
      bright within, because of his knowledge of the truth: “The Lord will fill
      your soul with brightness,” i.e., he will make it shine (Is 58:11).
      Secondly, it was bright without, because of his preaching: “You will shine
      in the world among them like stars, containing the word of life” (Phil
      2:15). Thirdly, it was bright because it manifested good works: “Let your
      light so shine before men that they may see your good works” (Mt 5:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      813 And so, because John was of himself so acceptable—for he was a lamp,
      not smothered out but blazing, not dark but burning brightly—he deserved
      to be accepted by you, as indeed he was, because
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >for a time you yourselves exulted in his light.</span
      >
      He fittingly links their exulting or rejoicing with light; because a man
      rejoices most is that which most pleases him. And among physical things
      nothing is more pleasant than light, according to: “It is a delight for
      the eyes to see the sun” (Sir 11:7). He says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >you yourselves exulted in his light,</span
      >
      i.e., you rested in John and put your end in him, thinking that he was the
      Messiah. But you did this only
      <span style="font-weight: bold">for a time,</span> because you wavered on
      this; for when you saw that John was leading men to another, and not to
      himself, you turned away from him. Thus we read in Matthew (21:32) that
      the Jews did not believe in John. They belonged to that group referred to
      by Matthew (13:21) as believing “for a while.”
    </p>
    <p>
      814 Then (v 36), he presents the divine testimony. First, he mentions its
      greatness; and then he continues on to describe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      815 He says: I do not need proof from men for my sake, but for your sake,
      for
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >I have testimony that is greater than that of John,</span
      >
      that is, the testimony of God, which is greater than the testimony of
      John: “If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is
      greater” (1 Jn 5:9), It is greater, I say, because of its greater
      authority, greater knowledge, and infallible truth, for God cannot
      deceive: “God is not like man, a liar” (Nm 23:19).
    </p>
    <p>
      816 God bore witness to Christ in three ways: by works, by himself, and by
      the Scriptures. First, he mentions his witness as given by the working of
      miracles; secondly, the way God gave witness by himself (v 37); thirdly,
      the witness given through the Scriptures (v 39).
    </p>
    <p>
      817 He says first:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >I have testimony that is greater than that of John,</span
      >
      that is, my works, i.e., the working of miracles,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the very works which my Father has given me to perform.</span
      >
      We should point out that it is natural for man to learn of the power and
      natures of things from their actions, and therefore our Lord fittingly
      says that the sort of person he is can be learned through the works he
      does. So, since he performed divine works by his own power, we should
      believe that he has divine power within him: “If I had not done among them
      the works which no one else did, they would not have sin,” that is, the
      sin of unbelief (below 15:24). And so he leads them to a knowledge of
      himself by appealing to his works, saying,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the very works which my Father has given me</span
      >
      in the Word, through an eternal generation, by giving me a power equal to
      his own. Or we could say,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the very works which my Father has given me,</span
      >
      in my conception, by making me one person who is both God and man,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">to perform,</span> i.e., to perform them
      by my own power. He says this to distinguish himself from those who do not
      perforrn miracles by their own power but have to obtain it as a favor from
      God; thus Peter says: “In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth: stand up”
      (Acts 3:6). Thus it was God, and not themselves, who accomplished these
      works; but Christ accomplished them by his own power: “Lazarus, come
      forth,” as John reports below (11:43). Accordingly,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >those works that I myself perform—they bear witness to me;</span
      >
      “If you do not believe me, at least believe my works” (below 10:38). We
      see from Mark (16:20) that God bears witness by the working of miracles:
      “The Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that
      followed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      818 Then (v 37), he presents the second way God bore witness to Christ,
      namely, by himself. First, he mentions the way; secondly, he shows that
      they were not able to receive this testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      819 He says: It is not only the works which my Father has given me to
      perform that bear witness to me, but
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >the Father who sent me has himself given testimony on my behalf:</span
      >
      in the Jordan, when Christ was baptized (Mt 3:17); and on the mountain,
      when Christ was transfigured (Mt 17:5). For on both these occasions the
      voice of the Father was heard: “This is my beloved Son.” And so they
      should believe in Christ, as the true and natural Son of God: “This is the
      testimony of God: he has borne witness to his Son” (1 Jn 5:9).
      Consequently, anyone who does not believe that he is the Son of God, does
      not believe in the testimony of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      820 Someone could say that God also gave testimony to others by himself:
      for example, to Moses, on the mountain, with whom God spoke while others
      were present. We, however, never heard his testimony, as the Lord says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">you have neither heard his voice.</span>
      On the other hand, we read in Deuteronomy (4:33): Did it ever happen
      before that the people heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of
      fire, as you heard, and have lived?” Then how can Christ say:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">you have neither heard his voice?</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      I reply, according to Chrysostom, that the Lord wishes to show those
      established in a philosophical frame of mind that God gives testimony to
      someone in two ways, namely, sensibly and intelligibly. Sensibly, as by a
      sensible voice only; and in this way he gave witness to Moses on Mount
      Sinai: “You heard his voice, and saw no form at all” (Dt 4:12). Likewise,
      he gives testimony by a sensible form, as he appeared to Abraham (Gn 26),
      and to Isaiah: “I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne” (Is
      6:1). However, in these visions, neither the audible voice nor the visible
      figure were like anything in the animal kingdom, except efficiently, in
      the sense that these were formed by God. For since God is a spirit, he
      neither emits audible sounds nor can he be portrayed as a figure. But he
      does bear testimony in an intelligible manner by inspiring in the hearts
      of certain persons what they ought to believe and to hold: “I will hear
      what the Lord God will speak within me” (Ps 84:9); “I will lead her into
      the wilderness and there I will speak to her heart,” as we read in Hosea
      (2:14).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you were able to receive the testimony given in the first of these
      ways; and this is not surprising, because they were the words and image of
      God only efficiently, as was said. But they were not able to receive the
      testimony given in that intelligible voice; so he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">you have neither heard his voice,</span>
      i.e., you were not among those who shared in it. “Everyone who has heard
      the Father and has learned, comes to me” (below 6:45). But you do not come
      to me. Therefore,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >you have neither heard his voice nor seen his image,</span
      >
      i.e., you do not have his intelligible testimony. Hence he adds:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >and you do not have his word abiding in your hearts,</span
      >
      i.e., you do not have his word that is inwardly inspired. And the reason
      is,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >for you do not believe in him whom he,</span
      >
      the Father, <span style="font-weight: bold">has sent</span>. For the word
      of God leads to Christ, since Christ himself is the natural Word of God.
      But every word inspired by God is a certain participated likeness of that
      Word. Therefore, since every participated likeness leads to its original,
      it is clear that every word inspired by God leads to Christ. And so,
      because you are not led to me,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">you do not have his word,</span> i.e., the
      inspired word of God,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">abiding in your hearts.</span> “He who
      does not believe in the Son of God does not have life abiding in him,” as
      it says below (sic). He says
      <span style="font-weight: bold">abiding,</span> because although there is
      no one who does not have some truth from God, they alone have the truth
      and the word abiding in them whose knowledge has progressed to the point
      where they have reached a knowledge of the true and natural Word.
    </p>
    <p>
      821 Or we could say that,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">you have neither heard his voice,</span>
      can be taken as showing the three ways in which God reveals things. This
      is done either by a sensible voice, as he bore witness to Christ in the
      Jordan and on the mountain, as in 2 Peter (1:16): “We were eyewitnesses of
      his greatness. For he received honor and glory from God the Father, when a
      voice came from the heavens.” And the Jews did not hear this. Or, God
      reveals things through a vision of his essence, which he reveals to the
      blessed. And they did not see this, because “while we are in the body, we
      are absent from the Lord” (2 Cor 5:6). Thirdly, it is accomplished by an
      interior word through an inspiration; and the Jews did not have this
      either.
    </p>
    <p>
      822 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Search the Scriptures,</span> he gives the
      third way in which God bore witness to Christ, through the Scriptures.
      First, he mentions the testimony of the Scriptures. Secondly, he shows
      that they were not able to gather the fruit of this testimony (v 40).
    </p>
    <p>
      823 He says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Search the Scriptures.</span> As if to
      say: You do not have the word of God in your hearts, but in the
      Scriptures; therefore, you must seek for it elsewhere than in your hearts.
      Hence, <span style="font-weight: bold">Search the Scriptures,</span> that
      is, the Old Testament, for the faith of Christ was contained in the Old
      Testament, but not on the surface, for it lay hidden in its depths, under
      shadowy symbols: “Even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil is over
      their hearts” (2 Cor 3:15). Thus he significantly says, Search, probe into
      the depths: “If you search for her [wisdom] like money, and dig for her
      like a treasure, you will understand the fear of the Lord and will find
      the knowledge of God” (Prv 2:4); “Give me understanding and I will search
      your commandments” (Ps 118:34).
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason why you should search them I take from your own opinion,
      because
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >you think you have eternal life in them,</span
      >
      since we read in Ezekiel (18:19): “He who has kept my commands will live.”
      But you are mistaken; because although the precepts of the old law are
      living, they do not contain life in themselves. They are said to be living
      only to the extent that they lead to me, the Christ. Yet you use them as
      though they contained life in themselves, and in this you are mistaken,
      for they bear witness to me, i.e., they are living to the extent that they
      lead to a knowledge of me. And they lead to a knowledge of me either by
      plain prophecies, as in Isaiah (7:14): “A virgin will conceive.” or in
      Deuteronomy (18:15): “The Lord your God will raise up a prophet for you.”;
      and so Acts (10:43) says: “All the prophets bear witness to him.” The
      Scriptures also lead to a knowledge of Christ through the symbolic actions
      of the prophets; thus we read: “I have used resemblences in the ministry
      of the prophets” (Hos 12:10). Knowledge of Christ is also given in their
      sacraments and figures, as in the immolation of’ the lamb, and other
      symbolic sacraments of the law: “The law has only a shadow of the good
      things to come” (Heb 10:1). And so, because “the Scriptures of the Old
      Testament gave much testimony about Christ, the Apostle says: “He promised
      the Good News before, through his prophets in the holy Scriptures; the
      Good News of his Son, a descendant of David in his human nature” (Rom
      1:2).
    </p>
    <p>
      824 The fruit which you think you have in the Scriptures, that is, eternal
      life, you will not be able to obtain, because in not believing the
      testimonies of the Scriptures about me,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">you are unwilling to come to me,</span>
      i.e., you do not wish to believe in me, in whom the fruit of these
      Scriptures exists,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">in order to possess that life</span> in
      me, the life which I give to those who believe in me: “I give them eternal
      life” (below 10:28); “Wisdom infuses life into her children” (Sir 4:12);
      “He who finds me will find life, and will have salvation from the Lord”
      (Prv 8:35).

      825 After God confirmed the greatness of his power by the testimonies of
      men, of’God, and of’ the Scriptures, he here rebukes the Jews for being
      slow to believe. Now the Jews persecuted Christ on two grounds: for
      breaking the Sabbath, by which he seemed to go against the law, and for
      saying that he is the Son of God, by which he seemed to go against God.
      Thus they persecuted him on account of their reverence for God and their
      zeal for the law. And so our Lord wishes to show that their persecution of
      him was really inspired not by these motives, but by contrary reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      He first shows that the cause of their unbelief was their lack of
      reverence for God. Secondly, that another cause of their unbelief was
      their lack of reverence for Moses (v 45). As to the first he does two
      things. First, he shows their irreverence for God. Secondly, he shows that
      this is the cause of their unbelief (v 44). Concerning the first he does
      two things. First, he mentions their lack of reverence for God. Secondly,
      he makes this obvious by a sign (v 43). With respect to the first he does
      two things. First, he rejects what they might have assumed to be his
      intention, from what he had said before. Secondly, he presents his real
      intention (v 42).
    </p>
    <p>
      826 The Jews might have assumed that Christ was seeking some kind of
      praise from men, since he had reminded them of so many witnesses to
      himself, as John, God, his own works, and the testimony of the Scriptures.
      Against this thought he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Praise from men I do not need,</span>
      i.e., I do not seek praise from men; for I have not come to be an example
      of one seeking human glory: “We did not seek glory from men” (1 Thes 2:6).
      Or, <span style="font-weight: bold">Praise from men I do not need</span>,
      i.e., I do not need human praise, because from eternity I have glory with
      the Father: “Glorify me, Father, with the glory I had before the world was
      made” (below 17:5). For I have not come to be glorified by men, but rather
      to glorify them, since all glory proceeds from me (Wis 7:25) [“Wisdom is a
      pure emanation of the glory of the almighty God.”] It is through this
      wisdom that I have glory. God is said to be praised and glorified by
      men—“Glorify the Lord as much as you are able; he will still surpass even
      that” (Sir 43:30)—not that he might become by this more glorious, but so
      that he might appear glorious among us.
    </p>
    <p>
      827 Thus Christ presented the various testimonies to himself not for the
      reason they thought, but for another one: because
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I know you,</span> i.e., I have made known
      about you, that
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >you do not have the love of God in your hearts,</span
      >
      although you pretend to have it. And so you are not persecuting me because
      of your love for God. You would be persecuting me for the love of God if
      God and the Scriptures did not bear witness to me; but God himself bears.
      witness to me by himself, his works and in the Scriptures, as has been
      said. Consequently, if you truly loved God, then so far from rejecting me,
      you would come to me. You, therefore, do not love God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another interpretation would be this. It is as though he were saying: I
      have not brought in these witnesses because I wanted your praise; but I
      know you do not love God and your waywardness makes me sad, and I want to
      lead you back to the way of truth: “Now they have seen and hated both me
      and my Father” (below 15:24); “The pride of those who hate you
      continuously rises,” as the Psalm (73:23) says.
    </p>
    <p>
      828 Here we should point out that God cannot be hated in himself by
      anyone, nor can he be hated with respect to all his effects, since every
      good in things comes from God, and it is impossible for anyone to hate all
      good, for he will at least love existence and life. But someone may hate
      some effect of God, insofar as this is opposed to what he desires: for
      example, he might hate punishment, and things of that sort. It is from
      this point of view that God is said to be hated.
    </p>
    <p>
      829 Then (v 43), he gives a sign that they do not love God. First, a
      present sign; secondly, a future sign (v 43b).
    </p>
    <p>
      830 The present sign concerns his own coming; so he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I have come in my Father’s name.</span> As
      if to say: What I say is obvious, for if one loves his Lord, it is clear
      that he will honor and receive one who comes from him, and seek to honor
      him. But
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I have come in my Father’s name,</span>
      and I make his name known to the world: “I have made your name known to
      those you have given me” (below 17:6),
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and yet you do not accept me.</span>
      Therefore, you do not love him. The Son is said to make his Father known
      to men because, although the Father, as God, was known—“God is known in
      Judah” (Ps 75:1)—yet he was not known as the natural Father of the Son
      before Christ came. Thus Solomon asked: “What is his name? And what is the
      name of his son?” Prv 30:4).
    </p>
    <p>
      831 The future sign concerns the coming of the Antichrist. For the Jews
      could say: Although you come in his name, we have not accepted you,
      because we will not accept anyone but God the Father. The Lord speaks
      against this, and says that it cannot be, because you will accept another,
      who will come, not in the Father’s name, but in his own name; and what is
      more, he will come, not in the name of the Father, but
      <span style="font-weight: bold">in his own name,</span> precisely because
      he will not seek the glory of the Father but his own. And whatever he
      does, he will attribute it, not to the Father, but to himself: “who
      opposes and is exalted above all that is called God, or is worshipped” (2
      Thes 2:4).
      <span style="font-weight: bold">You would be accepting him;</span> and so
      the Apostle continues in the same letter: “God will send them a misleading
      influence so that they might believe what is false” (2 Thes 2:11). And
      this, because they did not accept the true teaching, that they might be
      saved. So the Gloss says: “Because the Jews were unwilling to accept
      Christ, the penalty for this sin will be, fittingly enough, that they will
      receive the Antichrist; with the result that those who were unwilling to
      believe the truth, will believe a lie.”
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Augustine, however, we can understand this text as applying
      to heretics and false teachers: who spread a teaching that comes from
      their own hearts and not from the mouth of God, and who praise themselves
      and despise the name of God. Of such persons it is written: “You have
      heard that the Antichrist is coming; and now many antichrists have
      appeared” (1 Jn 2:18). So it is clear that your persecution of me does not
      spring from your love for God, but from your hatred and envy of him. And
      this was the reason why they did not believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      832 He concludes:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >How can people like you believe, when you crave praise from each
        other,</span
      >
      i.e., human praise,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >and yet not even ask for that one praise which is from God alone?</span
      >
      which is true glory. The reason they could not believe in Christ was that,
      since their proud minds were craving their own glory and praise, they
      considered themselves superior to others in glory, and regarded it as a
      disgrace to believe in Christ, who seemed common and poor. And this was
      why they could not believe in him. The one who can believe in Christ is
      the person of humble heart, who seeks the glory of God alone, and who
      strives to please him. And so we read: “Many of the leaders believed in
      him; but they did not admit it because of the Pharisees, so that they
      would not be expelled from the synagogue” (below 12:42). We can see from
      this just how dangerous vainglory is. For this reason Cicero says: “Let a
      man beware of that glory that robs him of all freedom; that freedom for
      which a man of great spirit should risk everything.” And the Gloss says:
      “It is a great vice to boast and to strive for human praise: to desire
      that others think you have what you really do not have.”
    </p>
    <p>
      833 Then (v 45), he shows that they do not have zeal for Moses. First, how
      Moses was against them. Secondly, he gives the reason for this opposition
      (v 46). As to the first he does two things First, he rejects their false
      zeal; secondly, he shows them true zeal,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">The one who accuses you is Moses.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      834 As to the first he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Do not think that I will accuse you before my Father.</span
      >
      There are three reasons for his saying this. First, the Son of God did not
      come into the world to condemn the world, but to save it. So he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Do not think</span> that I have come to
      condemn, I have come to free: “God did not send his Son into the world to
      judge the world,” that is, to condemn the world, “but that the world might
      be saved through him” (above 3:17). And so the blood of Christ cries out,
      not to accuse, but to forgive: “We have the blood of Christ, crying out
      better than that of Abel” (Heb 12:24), whose blood cried out to accuse;
      “Who will accuse God’s elect? It is Christ who justifies. Who is it, then,
      who will condemn?” (Rom 8:33). As to his second reason for saying this, he
      says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >Do not think that I will accuse you before my Father,</span
      >
      because I will not be the one to accuse you, but to judge you: “The Father
      has given all judgment to the Son” (above 5:22). The third reason is:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Do not think that I,</span> i.e., I alone,
      <span style="font-weight: bold">will accuse you before my Father</span>
      for what you are doing to me; for even Moses will accuse you for not
      believing him in the things he said of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      835 Consequently he adds:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you place your trust,</span
      >
      because you believe you are saved through his precepts. Moses accuses them
      in two ways. Materially, because they deserved to be accused for
      transgressing his commands: “Those who have sinned under the law, will be
      judged by the law” (Rom 2:12). Again, Moses accuses them because he and
      the other saints will have authority in the judgment: “The two-edged
      swords will be in their hands” (Ps 149:6).
    </p>
    <p>
      836 He presents the reason for this opposition when he says:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >If you believed Moses, you would perhaps believe me as well,</span
      >
      as is clear from “The Lord your God will raise up a prophet for you, from
      your nation and your brothers; he will be like me: you will listen to him”
      (Dt 18:15), and from all the sacrifices, which were a symbol of Christ. He
      says, perhaps, to indicate that their will acts from a free judgment, and
      not to imply that there is any doubt on the part of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      837 Then when he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >But if you do not believe in his written statements, how will you
        believe in my spoken words?</span
      >
      he gives a sign of this opposition. He does this by comparing two things,
      and then denying of the lesser of them what is denied of the greater.
      First, there is a comparison between Moses and Christ: for although
      Christ, absolutely speaking, is greater than Moses, Moses was the greater
      in reputation among the Jews. Thus he says: If you do not believe Moses,
      you will not believe me either. Secondly, he compares the way in which
      they presented their teaching: Moses gave his precepts in a written form;
      and so they can be studied for a long time, and are not easily forgotten.
      Hence they impose a stronger obligation to believe. But Christ presented
      his teachings in spoken words. Thus he says,
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >But if you do not believe in his written statements,</span
      >
      which you have preserved in your
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >books, how will you believe in my spoken words?</span
      >
