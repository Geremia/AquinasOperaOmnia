    <p>
      2068 Above, our Lord had used certain considerations to console his
      disciples over his leaving and against the persecutions and tribulations
      that would come upon them. Here he amplifies these considerations more
      clearly. First, he explains the considerations he gave before; and
      secondly, we see the effect of this explanation on the disciples (v 29).
    </p>
    <p>
      If we pay close attention to what was said in the pervious two chapters,
      we can see that our Lord aimed at consoling his disciples against two
      things: his own leaving them, and the tribulations that would come upon
      them. But he here explains these two things in reverse order. He had
      consoled them first over his leaving because this would take place very
      soon and he had not yet foretold all the tribulations that would come upon
      them. But now, since they seemed to be more troubled by their own
      tribulations than by Christ's leaving, our Lord here consoles them first
      of all against their forthcoming trials, and then against his leaving (v
      5). He does three things concerning the first: first, he gives his
      intention; secondly, he mentions the tribulations they will suffer from
      being persecuted (v 2); thirdly, he tells why they will be persecuted (v
      3).
    </p>
    <p>
      2069 He says: I have said that the Jews hate me and you, because they do
      not know who sent me. I have said that they are inexcusable and that you
      and the Holy Spirit will bear witness against them. Now
      <b>I have said all this to you to keep you from falling away</b>, that is,
      so you don't fall away when the tribulations I have foretold come upon
      you. And it is fitting that our Lord restrains them from falling after
      promising the Holy Spirit, because the Holy Spirit is love ‑ "God's love
      has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been
      given to us" (Rom 5:5) ‑ and the Holy Spirit prevents stumbling: "Great
      peace have those who love your law; nothing can make them stumble" (Ps
      119:165). Now it is characteristic of friends that they disregard any loss
      for the sake of one another, as stated in Proverbs [12:26]. So, for one
      who is a friend of God, to suffer punishment and loss is no reason to fall
      away. Yet because the disciples had not yet received the Holy Spirit
      before the death of Christ, they did fall away during his passion: "You
      will all fall away because of me this night" (Mt 26:31). But after the
      Holy Spirit came there was no falling away.
    </p>
    <p>
      2070 The disciples might say: Don't we have reason to fall away? Many
      troubles will come upon us: first, that of rejection; secondly, we will be
      killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      2071 They will be rejected from the society of the Jews; so he says,
      <b>They will put you out of the synagogues:</b> "The Jews had already
      agreed that if any one should confess him to be Christ, he was to be put
      out of the synagogue" (9:22). This was so successful that for this reason
      some of the [Jewish] authorities who did believe in Christ were afraid to
      profess him publicly, as we read above (12:42). Christ foretold this
      rejection: "Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude you
      and revile you, and cast out your name as evil, on account of the Son of
      man" (Lk 6:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      2072 Was it an evil for the apostles to be cast out of the Jewish
      synagogues, since they were going to leave them in any case? The answer,
      according to Augustine, is that it was a trial for them, because this was
      our Lord's way of telling them that the Jews would not accept Christ.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> For if
      they had received Christ, the synagogue of the Jews and the Church of
      Christ would have been the same; and those who would be converted to the
      Church of Christ would have been converted to the synagogue of the Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      2073 The other trial is that of being killed:
      <b
        >indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is
        offering service to God.</b
      >
      We can take these words as spoken to console the disciples, so that the
      <b>indeed</b> signifies a contrary train of thought and the sense would
      be: <b>indeed</b>, you ought to be consoled by what they will do to you,
      for
      <b
        >the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering
        service to God</b
      >. How is it a consolation for them that whoever kills them thinks he is
      serving God? The answer, according to Augustine, is that in saying,
      <b>they will put you out of the synagogues,</b> we are to understand that
      those converted to Christ would be immediately killed by the Jews.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> And so to
      console his disciples our Lord tells them that they would win so many to
      Christ, who would be expelled from the Jewish synagogues, that they could
      not all be killed, and so the Jews would try to kill the apostles so they
      would not convert all the people to the name of Christ by their preaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, we could say that here Christ is simply telling them beforehand that
      they will be killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      2074 He says,
      <b>whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God,</b> and not
      to the gods, to show that he is speaking only of persecution from the
      Jews: "I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will
      kill and crucify" (Mt 23:34). The martyrs of Christ were killed by the
      gentiles, and they did not consider that they were serving God but only
      their own gods. It was the Jews who, when they killed those who were
      preaching Christ, thought this was a service to God. For they had zeal for
      God, but without knowledge, since they believed that anyone who converted
      to Christ was deserting God. We read of this killing: "For your sake we
      are slain all the day long, and accounted as sheep for the slaughter" (Ps
      44:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      2075 He gives the reason why this will be so (v 3), first stating the
      reason, and then saying why he foretold this persecution (v 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      2076 He says, they will persecute you, but <b>they will do this,</b> not
      out of zeal for the truth, but
      <b>because they have not known the Father</b>, as Father, <b>nor me</b>,
      his Son: "If you did know me, perhaps you would have known my Father also"
      [8:19]; "I formerly blasphemed and persecuted and insulted him; but I
      received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief" (1 Tim 1:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      2077 One could ask: If the Jews are going to persecute you because of
      their ignorance of the faith, why did Christ foretell this to you? So
      Christ first gives the reason why he foretold this; and secondly, why he
      did not tell them before (v 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      2078 He says,
      <b
        >But I have said these things to you, that when their hour comes you may
        remember that I told you of them.</b
      >
      The hour is said to come for people when they are able to accomplish what
      they desire and do what they want: "Let not the flower of time," that is,
      the hour ripe for indulging in pleasures, "pass us by" [Wis 2:7]. So the
      hour of the Jews will come when they are able to begin to persecute you.
      This is the hour of darkness: "But this is your hour, and the power of
      darkness" (Lk 22:53).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>That you may remember that I told you of them.</b> This would help in
      two ways. In the midst of their persecutions, when they recalled that
      Christ had predicted them, they would realize his divinity and become more
      confident of his help. Again, when people foresee that tribulations are
      soon to come, they are less afflicted by them, for forewarned is
      forearmed. Cicero gives the reason for this in his
      <i>Tusculan Questions</i>.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> The
      better temporal goods and evils are known, he says, the less they are
      regarded. Thus, riches are more highly regarded by those who don't have
      them than by the same people after they acquire them. In the same way,
      troubles are more feared and considered more oppressive before they are
      experienced than when they have come and are present. Now when evil is
      meditated upon before it actually comes, this makes it present in a
      certain sense, and because of this presence it is less regarded. So Cicero
      says that one who is wise, by premeditation on evils before they strike,
      can acquire strength against the sadness they will bring. Accordingly,
      Christ foretold the apostles about their tribulations for two reasons: to
      increase their confidence in his help, and to lessen their sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      2079 Here he gives the reason why he did not foretell these things to them
      before, namely, <b>because I was with you.</b> We can relate this to the
      two points just mentioned. First, to the increasing of their hope. While I
      was with you, you had confidence in my help. But now that you will see me
      die, you might doubt my power. Consequently, I must foretell certain
      things that are to come so that you may realize my divinity and power. Or,
      we can refer this to the second point, and then the meaning becomes this:
      <b>I was with you,</b> protecting you, and letting you cast all your
      troubles on me ‑ "Father... while I was with them, I kept them in your
      name" (17:12). But since I am about to leave you, the entire weight of
      your troubles will fall upon yourselves. And so it is necessary that your
      be forewarned.
    </p>
    <p>
      2080 Yet it seems that our Lord did predict similar things before, for the
      other Evangelists tells us that before this the Lord foretold to his
      disciples that they would be handed over to the authorities and rulers and
      that they would be scourged in the Jewish synagogues. This is not at odds
      with what our Lord says here,
      <b>I did not say these things to you from the beginning,</b> because they
      said that our Lord said this to them on the Mount of Olives, when his
      passion was near, that is, three days before the last supper. So the
      phrase, <b>from the beginning,</b> does not refer to the time of the
      passion, but to the time [of his public ministry, before the time of his
      passion] when he was first with his disciples, as Augustine says.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      2081 But this conflicts with Matthew. For he says that our Lord foretold
      that tribulations would come to the disciples not only when his passion
      was fast approaching, but even when he first chose them: "I send you out
      as sheep in the midst of wolves" (Mt 10:16). One must say then that
      <b>from the beginning</b> refers to the Holy Spirit, for he did not tell
      them of the coming of the Holy Spirit from the beginning, as Augustine
      says. <a href="John16.htm#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, it could be said, with Chrysostom, that Christ is referring to their
      tribulations.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a> In this
      case, he did not tell them <b>from the beginning</b> two things which he
      now newly foretells. One is that they would suffer persecutions from the
      Jews, which he had not said previously, but had only mentioned the
      gentiles, as is clear from Matthew (10). The second regards something he
      had previously foretold them, which was that they would be scourged. But
      he now adds an element which was especially troublesome, which was that
      the Jews would regard their death as a service to God.<br />

    <p>
      2082 Above, our Lord dealt with what would console his disciples in their
      coming troubles. Here he deals with what will console them against his
      leaving. Our Lord consoles them against his leaving with three
      considerations: first, they will have access to the Father, as promised
      when he said, "Let not your hearts be troubled... In my Father's house
      there are many rooms" (14:1); secondly, because he was going to send the
      Paraclete, and so he said, "And I will pray the Father, and he will give
      you another Paraclete" [14:16]; thirdly, they will see him again, as he
      said, "I will not leave your orphans; I will come to you" [14:18]. He
      explains these three things here, but not in the above order. First, we
      see the promise of the Spirit; secondly, the fact that they will see him
      again (v 16); thirdly, we see their access to the Father. He does two
      things with the first: first, he mentions that they need some consolation;
      secondly, he gives it (v 7). He does two things with the first: first, he
      foretells his leaving them; secondly, he mentions the effect of this
      prediction (v 6).
    </p>
    <p>
      2083 He is leaving them, going to the Father. He says, I was with you till
      now, <b>but now I am going to him who sent me</b>, that is, to the Father.
      This is a mark of perfection, for a thing reaches its perfection when it
      returns to its source: "I am ascending to him who sent me" (Tob 12:20);
      "The rivers return to the place from which they came" [Sir 1:7]. He went,
      in his human nature, to the one with whom he was from all eternity, in his
      divine nature. This was explained more fully before.
    </p>
    <p>
      2084 He adds, <b>yet none of you asks me, Where are you going?</b> Why
      does he says this? For Peter asked, "Lord, where are you going?" (13:36);
      and Thomas said, "Lord, we do not know where you are going" (14:5). Both
      Chrysostom and Augustine give an answer to this, but not the same one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chrysostom says that when the disciples heard that they would be killed
      and cast out of the synagogues, they became so sad and stunned that they
      practically forgot about Christ's leaving them and losing the thread of
      his thought did not ask him about this.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> So Christ
      says,
      <b
        >but because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your
        hearts.</b
      >
      Thus when our Lord says,
      <b
        >But now I am going to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, Where
        are you going?</b
      >
      he is really reproving them, according to Chrysostom. They did not
      question him about this: "Ask your Father, and he will show you" (Deut
      32:7); "Search out and seek, and she will become known to you" (Sir 6:28).
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustine, on the other hand, thinks that the statement,
      <b>But now I am going to him who sent me</b>, does not refer to this very
      time when he is speaking, but refers to the time when he was to ascend
      into heaven.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a> It
      was like saying: You asked me before where I was going; but I will be
      going now in such a way that you will not have to ask me,
      <b>Where are you going?</b> because "as they were looking on, he was
      lifted up" (Acts 1:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      2085 Now he mentions the sorrow of the disciples. For Chrysostom this
      sorrow is the effect of Christ's prediction [of the future troubles of the
      disciples] ‑ For Augustine, their sorrow is the effect of Christ's
      leaving, for they were glad to be in his presence, and attracted in a
      certain carnal way to him in his human nature, like one friend is pleased
      at the presence of another. So they were sad that he was leaving: "Weeping
      may tarry for the night," that is, the time of the passion, "but joy
      comes" to the apostles "with the morning" of the resurrection (Ps 30:5).
      It is human for sorrow to touch our hearts, but it is bad when it
      completely takes over our heart because it then destroys our reason. So he
      says, somewhat like a rebuke, <b>sorrow has filled your hearts;</b> "Do
      not give yourself over to sorrow" (Sir 30:21); "Let not your hearts be
      troubled" (14:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      2086 Now he mentions one of the things which will console them, the
      promise of the Holy Spirit. First, he promises the Holy Spirit; secondly,
      he foretells the effect of the Spirit (v 8).
    </p>
    <p>
      2087 He does two things about the first. First, he points out the
      necessity of his going; secondly, he shows that his going is beneficial.
    </p>
    <p>
      He says, <b>sorrow has filled your hearts,</b> because I am leaving; but
      you should rather be glad, because
      <b>it is to your advantage that I go away,</b> that is, it is very
      necessary for you,
      <b>for if I do not go away, the Paraclete will not come to you.</b>
      Furthermore, my going is very fruitful and beneficial for you, because
      <b>if I go, I will send him to you.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2088 But, could not Christ have sent the Holy Spirit while he was still
      living in the flesh? He could have, because even at his baptism the Holy
      Spirit descended upon him in the form of a dove and never left him.
      Indeed, from the instant of his conception he received the Spirit without
      measure. But Christ did not choose to give the Spirit to his disciples
      while he was still living among them for four reasons. First, they were
      not prepared, for carnal love is contrary to the Holy Spirit, since the
      Spirit is spiritual love. Now the disciples were affected by a certain
      carnal love for the human nature of Christ, without yet being elevated to
      a spiritual love of his divinity. And so they were not yet ready for the
      Holy Spirit: "From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point
      of view," with carnal affection; "even though we once regarded Christ from
      a human point of view," before his passion, "we regard him thus no longer"
      (2 Cor 5: 16).
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, Christ did not give them the Spirit then because of the
      characteristic of divine help, which is to be especially present in times
      of need: "A stronghold in times of trouble" (Is 9:9); "For my father and
      my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord will take me up" (Ps 27:10). Now
      as long as Christ was with them, he was all the help they needed. But when
      he left they were exposed to many tribulations, and so another consoler
      and helper was very quickly given to them: "He will give you another
      Paraclete" [14:16]; "Whom will he teach knowledge? Those who are weaned
      from the milk, those taken from the breast" (Is 28:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, the Spirit was not given then out of consideration for the
      dignity of Christ. As Augustine says in his book
      <i>On the Trinity,</i> Christ as human does not have the power to give the
      Holy Spirit, but he does as God.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a> When
      he was with his disciples, he seemed to be human, just like them. And so
      that it would not seem that it was a mere human being who was giving the
      Holy Spirit, Christ did not give the Spirit before his ascension: "the
      Spirit has not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified" (7:39)
      "Send her forth from the holy heavens" (Wis 9:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourthly, the Spirit was not given at that time to preserve unity in the
      Church. We saw that "John did no sign" (10:41), and this was so in order
      not to divert the people from Christ, and to make the superiority of
      Christ over John more evident. But the disciples were to be filled with
      the Holy Spirit so that they could do even greater works than Christ had
      done: "And greater works than these will he do" (14:12). If the Holy
      Spirit had been given to them before the passion, the people might have
      become confused as to who really was the Christ, and they would be
      divided: "You have ascended to the heights, and have given gifts to men"
      [Ps 68:18].
    </p>
    <p class="MsoHeader"></p>
    <p>
      2089 Chrysostom thinks that we can use this as an argument against the
      Macedonians.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a> They
      say that the Holy Spirit is a creature and the minister of the Father and
      the Son. But if this were true, the coming of the Holy Spirit would not
      have been a sufficient consolation to the Apostles for Christ's leaving
      them. It would be like the departure of a king, where the substitution for
      him of one of his ministers would not be a sufficient consolation. Thus,
      because the Holy Spirit is equal to the Son, our Lord consoles them by
      promising that the Spirit will come.
    </p>
    <p>
      2090 Yet if the Son and the Holy Spirit are equal, why is it to their
      advantage that the Son leave so that the Holy Spirit can come? The Son
      left as far as concerns his bodily presence, but he came invisibly
      together with the Holy Spirit. If the Son had dwelt here invisibly and
      said, "It is to your advantage that I go because the Holy Spirit will
      come," people would think the Holy Spirit was greater than the Son.<br />

      2091 Above, our Lord consoled his apostles by promising them the Holy
      Spirit. Here he shows the benefit the Holy Spirit will bring to them when
      he comes. He mentions three benefits: one for the world; a second for the
      disciples; and a third for Christ. As for the world, the Holy Spirit will
      convince the world; as for the apostles, the Spirit will teach them (v
      12); as for Christ, the Spirit will glorify him (v 14). First, he mentions
      the benefit of the Spirit's coming for the world; secondly, he explains it
      (v 9).
    </p>
    <p>
      2092 He says: It is to your advantage that I go, because I will send the
      Holy Spirit to you,
      <b
        >and when he comes, he will convince the world of sin and of
        righteousness and of judgment.</b
      >
      This has received two interpretations; one by Augustine, and the other by
      Chrysostom.
    </p>
    <p>
      2093 Augustine explains it this way.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" id="_ftnref14">[14]</a>
      <b>And when he comes</b>, the Holy Spirit, that is,
      <b>he will convince</b>, that is, rebuke or reprove,
      <b>the world.</b> "Reprove a wise man, and he will love you" (Ps 9:8).
    </p>
    <p>
      But did not Christ also rebuke the world? He did, as in "You are of your
      father the devil" (8:44), and in Matthew (c 23) he said many things
      against the Pharisees and Scribes. Why then does he say,
      <b>he will convince,</b> as though he himself did not reprove?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps someone will say that Christ rebuked only the Jews, but that the
      Holy Spirit, in and through the disciples, will rebuke the entire world.
      But this is in opposition to the fact that Christ also speaks in and
      through the apostles, just as the Holy Spirit does: "You desire proof that
      Christ is speaking in me" (2 Cor 13:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      One must therefore say that, <b>he will convince</b>, rebuke,
      <b>the world,</b> as the one who will invisibly enter into their hearts
      and pour his charity into them so that their fear is conquered and they
      have the strength to rebuke. For as was already said, as long as the
      disciples were carnally attracted to Christ, the Holy Spirit was not in
      them as he would be later. Consequently they were not as courageous then
      as they were after the Spirit came. "Their power," the power of the
      apostles, "came from the Spirit of his mouth" [Ps 33:6]; "Then the Spirit
      of God took possession of Zechariah" (2 Chron 24:20). Again,
      <b>he will convince the world</b> because he will fill hearts which were
      before worldly and lead them to rebuke themselves: "I will reprove my ways
      in his sight" [Job 13:15]. The Holy Spirit does this: "Put a new and right
      spirit within me" (Ps 51:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      2094 For what will the Spirit rebuke the world? For three things. He will
      reprove the worldly for the sin they have committed: "Declare to my people
      their transgression" (Is 58:1). And this was done by the apostles: "Their
      voice goes out through all the earth" (Ps 19:4). He will reprove the world
      for the righteousness it has neglected. And the apostles did this: "None
      is righteousness, no not one" (Rom 3:10). And the Spirit will reprove the
      world because of the judgment it has held in contempt: "When wickedness
      comes, contempt comes also" (Prv 18:3); "She [Jerusalem] has despised my
      judgments" [Ez 5:6].
    </p>
    <p>
      2095 Now he explains all this. First, what he says about their sin,
      because they do not believe in me. The Spirit rebukes them only for the
      sin of disbelief because by faith all other sins are remitted. In a
      similar way our Lord charges the damned only with a lack of mercy, because
      all sins are washed away by mercy: "By mercy and faith sins are cleansed
      away" [Prv 15:27]. The same applies here, because as long as they remain
      in disbelief, their other sins remain, but when there is no longer
      disbelief the other sins are remitted. He says, "because they do not
      believe in me," using the form <i>in me,</i> and not the forms
      <i>mihi</i> or <i>me,</i> because even the devils believe that Christ
      exists and they tremble (Jas 2:19). In me, that is, with a faith enlivened
      by hope and love. [On faith "in me" see no. 901 above]
    </p>
    <p>
      2096 Secondly, he explains what he said about righteousness when he says
      <b>because I go to the Father</b>. This can be understood in two ways:
      either as referring to the righteousness of Christ or that of the
      apostles. As referring to the righteousness of the apostles the
      explanation is this: the world will be rebuked because of our
      righteousness, because the world has not imitated it. The righteousness, I
      say, which is not from the law but from faith: "The righteousness of God
      through faith in Jesus Christ" (Rom 3:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith is concerned with what is invisible (Heb 11:1). Now the disciples
      saw one thing, the humanity of Christ, and did not see another, his
      divinity. But Christ promises this to them as a reward: "I will...
      manifest myself to him" (14:21). Thus, the disciples had faith only
      regarding the divinity of Christ; but when Christ's human nature was taken
      from them, they had faith regarding both. And so, according to Augustine
      in his <i>Commentary on John</i>, when Christ says,
      <b>because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more</b>, it is like
      saying: You believe in me, that is, as regards my divinity, and because I
      go to the Father, you will believe in me also as regards my humanity.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="" id="_ftnref15"
        >[15]</a
      >
      This is the righteousness of faith which the world does not imitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He says, <b>and you will see me no more,</b> not because they would never
      see him, but because they would not see him in that mortal flesh. They did
      see him at the resurrection, but then he was immortal; and they will see
      him at the judgment, coming in glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This phrase is expounded as referring to the righteousness of Christ in
      the book, <i>On the Words of the Lord</i>.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a> The
      Jews were unwilling to recognize the righteousness of Christ: "We know
      that this man is a sinner" (9:24). But he will manifest his righteousness
      to them, saying <b>because I go to the Father</b>: for the very fact that
      I go to the Father is a sign of my righteousness. Christ descended because
      of his mercy, but his ascension was due to his righteousness: "Therefore
      God has highly exalted him" (Phil 2:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      2097 Thirdly, the Holy Spirit reproves the world by the judgment. This is
      because <b>the ruler of this world is already judged</b>. It is the devil
      who is the ruler of this world, that is, of worldly people. He is the
      ruler, not by creation, but by his suggestions and their imitation of him:
      "Those on his side imitate him" [Wis 2:25]; "He is king over all the sons
      of pride" (Job 41:34). Therefore, this ruler <b>is already judged</b>,
      that is, cast outside: "Now is the judgment of this world," that is, in
      favor of the world, "now shall the ruler of this world be cast out"
      (12:31). He says this to anticipate the excuse that some will make for
      their sins, saying that the devil tempted them. He is saying in effect:
      They cannot be excused because the devil has been cast out by the grace
      and faith of Christ and by the Holy Spirit, cast out from the hearts of
      the faithful so that he no longer tempts from within as before, but from
      without. And so those who resolve to cling to Christ can resist. This is
      why the devil, who has conquered the strongest males, can be conquered by
      frail women. Thus the world is reproved by this judgment because being
      unwilling to resist, it is overcome by the devil, who although expelled is
      brought back by their consent to sin: "Let not sin therefore reign in your
      mortal bodies" (Rom 6:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      Another explanation is in the book, <i>The Words of the Lord.</i> It says
      here that the phrase, <b>is already judged</b>, refers to the judgment of
      condemnation.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" id="_ftnref17">[17]</a> That
      is, the ruler of this world is already condemned, and consequently all who
      adhere to him: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared
      for the devil and his angels" (Mt 25:41). The world is reproved by this
      judgment because although the world knows that its ruler has been
      condemned, it has not escaped from this judgment but is judged with its
      ruler, because it imitates his pride and evil ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      2098 Chrysostom gives another explanation of this passage, as follows.
      <b>When he comes</b>, the Holy Spirit, <b>he will convince</b>, that is,
      convict, the world of sin.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" id="_ftnref18">[18]</a> It is
      like saying: The Holy Spirit will be a witness against the world: "God
      also bore witness by signs and wonders" (Heb 2:4). He will show that they
      have sinned grievously <b>because they did not believe in me,</b> when
      they see that the Holy Spirit will be given in my name to those who
      believe: "And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit
      whom God has given to those who obey him" (Acts 5:32). The Holy Spirit
      will be a witness to my <b>righteousness</b>, which the world did not
      think I possessed. And he will be this witness
      <b>because I go to the Father</b>, and will send you the Spirit, who will
      show that I am righteous and have led a faultless life: "Whom I shall send
      to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth" (15:26); and in the
      Psalm [68:18] we see that after Christ ascends he gives gifts to men. He
      will be a witness
      <b>of judgment, because the ruler of this world is already judged,</b>
      that is, it is by the Holy Spirit that he is judged, that is, cast out of
      the hearts of those who believe: "I will remove from the land... the
      unclean spirit" (Zech 13:2); "Now we have received not the spirit of the
      world, but the Spirit which is from God" (1 Cor 2:12). He will convict the
      world by his judgment because the world wickedly judged that Christ had a
      devil and cast out devils by Beelzebul. The Holy Spirit, which I will
      send, will condemn the devil and cast him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      2099 Now he mentions the benefit his disciples will receive from the
      coming of the Holy Spirit; this benefit is their instruction. First, he
      states their need for instruction; secondly, he promises this instruction
      (v 13); thirdly, he eliminates a difficulty (v 13b).
    </p>
    <p>
      2100 He says: the coming of the Holy Spirit will benefit the world because
      he will rebuke it. But the Spirit will also benefit you by instructing
      you. You need this instruction because
      <b>I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</b>
      It is like saying: I have instructed you, but you are not completely
      instructed: "Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways; and how small a
      whisper do we hear of him. But the thunder of his power who can
      understand?" (Job 26:14). It would be foolish to ask what those many
      things were which they could not bear, as Augustine remarks.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a> For
      if they could not bear them, much less can we.
    </p>
    <p>
      2101 The statement, <b>you cannot bear them now,</b> has been used by
      certain heretics as a cover for their errors. They tell their adherents
      the basest things in private, things they would not dare to say openly, as
      though these were the things the disciples were not then able to bear, and
      as though the Holy Spirit taught them these things which a man would blush
      to teach and preach openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should not think that some secret teaching is kept from believers who
      are uneducated, and taught to those who are more learned. Indeed, matters
      of faith are presented to all the faithful: "What I tell you in the dark,
      utter in the light" (Mt 10:27). Still, they have to be presented in one
      way to the uneducated and in another way to the learned. For instance,
      certain fine points about the mystery of the Incarnation and the other
      mysteries would not be presented to the uneducated because they would not
      understand them and they would actually be an obstacle. So our Lord
      presented all matters of faith to his disciples, but not in the way he
      later revealed them, and especially not in the way they will be presented
      in eternal life. Accordingly, what they could not bear then was the full
      knowledge of divine things, such as knowledge of the equality of the Son
      with the Father and other things of that sort which they did not then
      know. Paul says, "He heard things that cannot be told, which man may not
      utter" (2 Cor 12:4), these things were the very truths of faith, not
      something else, but known in a more profound way. Again, the disciples did
      not then have a spiritual understanding of all the scriptures, but did
      only when "He opened their minds to understand the scriptures" (Lk 24:45).
      Also, the disciples did not then have a full understanding of the
      sufferings and dangers they were to undergo ‑ they could not bear such
      knowledge then as their spirits were weak: "Put your shoulder under her
      and carry her" (Sir 6:25). For these reasons the disciples were in need of
      further instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      2102 Then he promises that they will be instructed by the coming of the
      Holy Spirit, who will teach them all truth. For since the Holy Spirit is
      from the Truth, it is appropriate that the Spirit teach the truth, and
      make those he teaches like the one who sent him. He says,
      <b>all the truth,</b> that is, the truth of the faith. He will teach them
      to have a better understanding of this truth in this life, and a fullness
      of understanding in eternal life, where we will know as we are known (see
      1 Cor 13:12); "His anointing teaches you about everything, and is true,
      and is no lie" (1 Jn 2:27). Or, <b>all the truth,</b> that is, of the
      figures of the law, which understanding the apostles received from the
      Holy Spirit. We read in Daniel (1:17) that the Lord gave to his children
      wisdom and understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      2103 Now he excludes a difficulty which could have arisen. If the Holy
      Spirit will teach them, it seems that he is greater than Christ. This is
      not true, because the Spirit will teach them by the power of the Father
      and the Son, <b>for he will not speak from himself,</b> but from me,
      because he will be from me. Just as the Son does not act from himself but
      from the Father, so the Holy Spirit, because he is from another, that is,
      from the Father and the Son,
      <b>will not speak from himself, but whatever he will hear</b> by receiving
      knowledge as well as his essence from eternity, <b>he will speak</b>, not
      in a bodily way but by enlightening your minds from within: "I will bring
      her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her" (Hos 2:14); "Let me
      hear what God the Lord will speak" (Ps 85:8).
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="" id="_ftnref20"
        >[20]</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      2104 Since the Holy Spirit hears from eternity, why does he say he will
      hear? We should say to this that eternity includes all time. Consequently,
      the Holy Spirit, who hears from all eternity, is said to hear in the
      present, in the past, and in the future. Yet at times he is said to hear
      in the future because the knowledge in question concerns things that are
      still in the future. <b>He will speak,</b> therefore, whatever he will
      hear, for he will not only teach about things that are eternal, but future
      things. Thus he adds,
      <b>he will declare to you the things that are to come,</b> which is a
      characteristic of God: "She has foreknowledge of signs and wonders" (Wis
      8:8); "Tell us what is to come hereafter, that we may know that you are
      gods" (Is 41:23). This is characteristic of the Holy Spirit: "I will pour
      out my spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy"
      (Joel 2:28). So they would have no doubts about how they would know of the
      coming tribulations, which Christ predicted for them, he adds,
      <b>and he will declare to you the things that are to come</b>, that is,
      upon you.<br />

    <p>
      2105 Above, we saw two fruits of the coming of the Holy Spirit, which were
      the rebuking of the world and the instruction of the disciples. Now the
      third fruit is mentioned, the glorification of Christ. First, he mentions
      this fruit, the glorification; secondly, the reason for it (v 14b);
      thirdly, he expands on this (v 15).
    </p>
    <p>
      2106 He says: "He will teach all truth," because
      <b>he will glorify me,</b> in whom is all truth: "I am the way, and the
      truth, and the life" (14:6); "In whom," that is, in Christ, "are hid all
      the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (Col 2:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>He will glorify me,</b> that is, give a clear knowledge of me. He will
      do this, first of all, by enlightening the disciples: for they were still
      carnal and attached to Christ in a carnal way, that is, in the weakness of
      his flesh, not realizing the grandeur of his divinity. Later, they were
      able to grasp this through the Holy Spirit: "God has revealed to us
      through the Spirit" (1 Cor 2:10). Secondly, the Spirit will give them the
      confidence to preach clearly, openly. Before this the disciples were so
      timid that they did not dare to profess Christ publicly, but when they
      were filled with the Holy Spirit fear was cast out, and they proclaimed
      Christ to the people, being somehow impelled by that same Spirit: "He will
      come like a rushing stream, which the wind [or Spirit] of the Lord drives"
      (Is 59:19). This is why the Apostle says: "The love of Christ impels us"
      [2 Cor 5:14]. Thirdly, the Spirit will glorify Christ by accomplishing
      marvelous works in and through the apostles: "All things are inspired by
      one and the same Spirit" (1 Cor 12:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      2107 Now we see the reason why the Holy Spirit will glorify Christ: it is
      because the Son is the principle of the Holy Spirit. For everything which
      is from another manifests that from which it is. Thus the Son manifests
      the Father because he is from the Father. And so because the Holy Spirit
      is from the Son, it is appropriate that the Spirit glorify the Son. He
      says, <b>he will glorify me, for he will receive from me.</b> However, the
      Holy Spirit does not receive in the same way creatures do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When creatures receive, three things are found, and two of these are not
      found in the divinity. In creatures, that which receives is one thing, and
      what is received is something else. This is not so in the divinity, since
      the divine persons are simple, and not composed of several elements.
      Indeed, the Holy Spirit receives his entire substance from whomever this
      Spirit receives, and so does the Son. Another difference is that among
      creatures the one who receives did not have at one time what he receives,
      as when matter receives a form, or a subject receives an accident: for at
      some time the matter was without such a form, and the subject without that
      accident. This is not so in the divinity, because what the Son receives
      from the Father the Son has from eternity, and what the Holy Spirit
      receives from the Father and the Son, the Spirit has from eternity.
      Accordingly, the Holy Spirit receives from the Son like the Son receives
      from the Father: "What my Father has given to me is greater than all"
      (10:29). Thus, when the expression "to receive" is used of the divinity,
      it indicates an order in origin.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" id="_ftnref22">[22]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      2108 Note that when he says, <b>he will receive from me,</b> the word
      <b>from</b> (<i>de</i>, "from" or "of") does not indicate participation,
      but consubstantiality, because the Spirit receives all that the Son has.
      For just as the Son is from (<i>de</i>) the substance of the Father,
      because he receives the entire substance of the Father, so also the Holy
      Spirit is from (<i>de</i>) the substance of the Son because the Spirit
      receives the whole substance of the Son. Thus, because
      <b>he will receive from me,</b> and I am the Word of God, therefore he
      will <b>declare it to you</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      2109 Now this reason is further explained when Christ shows that the Holy
      Spirit received from him because of the unity and consubstantiality of the
      Father and the Son. First, we see the consubstantiality of the Father and
      Son; secondly, the conclusion is drawn,
      <b>therefore I said that he will receive from me.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2110 He says: he will receive from me because
      <b>all that the Father has is mine.</b> This is like saying: Although the
      Spirit of truth proceeds from the Father, yet because
      <b>all that the Father has is mine,</b> (and the Spirit is the Spirit of
      the Father), the Spirit receives from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that one "has" something in two ways: in one way as a possession, and
      in the other way as something existing in oneself, as a form or a part.
      The Father has as a possession and as something subject to himself the
      totality of created things: "The earth is the Lord's and the fullness
      thereof" (Ps 24:1). The Father also has something which is in him, indeed,
      which is himself, because the Father is whatever is in Christ, since the
      Father is his own essence, own goodness, own truth and own eternity. The
      word "has" is being used in this sense here. And so whatever the Father
      has is the Son's, because the Son has the same wisdom and the same
      goodness that the Father also has: "For as the Father has life in himself,
      so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself" (5:26); "All
      things have been delivered to me by my Father" (Mt 11:27).
    </p>
    <p>
      2111 As Didymus says, some might make this objection: If all that the
      Father has the Son also has, then since the Father has the characteristic
      of fatherhood, it follows that the Son also has this.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" id="_ftnref23">[23]</a> I
      answer that this argument would appear to be valid if our Lord had said,
      "All that God has is mine." But he says,
      <b>all that the Father has is mine,</b> and this keeps a distinction
      between the Father and the Son, and leads us to understand that all that
      the Father has is the Son's, except that by which the Father is
      distinguished from the Son. For by using the word Father, Christ declares
      that he is the Son, and has not usurped the attribute of fatherhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      2112 We have conceded that whatever the Father has the Son has, but not
      that the Son has it in the same order as the Father. For the Son has as
      receiving from another; while the Father has as giving to another. Thus,
      the distinction is not in what is had, but in the order of having. Now
      relations of this kind, that is, of fatherhood and sonship, signify a
      distinction of order: for fatherhood signifies a giving to another and
      sonship a receiving from another.
    </p>
    <p>
      2113 One might ask whether a relation is something real in the divinity.
      It seems that it is: for if not, then since the divine persons are
      distinguished by relations, the distinction of the persons would not be
      real. The answer to this is that in the divinity a relation is considered
      in two ways. In one way, a relation is considered in comparison to the
      essence or person of the Father. And in this way the relation of Father is
      not other than the essence or person of the Father. In the other way, a
      relation can be considered in comparison to the opposite relation, for
      example, to sonship. In this way fatherhood is a real relation, because it
      signifies an order of the nature which the Father gives the Son by an
      eternal generation. And this order is really in God. Therefore, if
      fatherhood is compared to the essence of the Father, all that the Father
      has the Son has, because fatherhood is not other than the essence of the
      Father, but the Son does not have it in the same order, as was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      2114 Now he draws his conclusion, that the Holy Spirit receives from the
      Son. If all things which the Father has are the Son's, and the Son is
      consubstantial to the Father, it is necessary that the Holy Spirit proceed
      from the Son as he proceeds from the Father, as Hilary and Didymus argue.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand this we should note that among created things in every
      procession or origination that by which the agent acts or gives what it
      has is the same as what the recipient receives. For instance, fire which
      has been generated receives the form of fire which the generating fire
      gives it by its own form. There is something similar to this in the origin
      of the divine persons, because that by which the Father gives his nature
      to the Son (not by will, but by nature), is the same as that which he
      gives. Still there is an unlikeness in this way: in creatures, that which
      is communicated and that by which it is communicated is only the same in
      species, not the same individual; but in the divinity, what the Father
      gives to the Son and that by which he gives or communicates it is the same
      individual nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      2115 Note that we say that the Son receives from (<i>de</i>) the substance
      of the Father, that is, he receives the substance of the Father; and we
      say that the Holy Spirit receives from the substance of the Father and the
      Son; and that the Father, by virtue of his nature, gives his substance to
      the Son, and the Father and the Son give to the Holy Spirit. But we do not
      say that the Father is from (<i>de</i>) the substance of the Son, or that
      the Father and the Son are from the substance of the Holy Spirit, because
      the "from" <i>(de)</i> signifies consubstantiality with an order of
      origin. Thus, what is communicated to the Holy Spirit is what is common to
      the Father and the Son. Now in the divinity the principle of communication
      must be the same as what is communicated. And so if what is communicated
      to the Holy Spirit is as essence, that which communicates must be this
      essence. This essence, however, is common to the Father and the Son. So,
      if the Father gives his essence to the Holy Spirit, the Son must also do
      so. For this reason he says, <b>all that the Father has is mine.</b> And
      if the Holy Spirit receives from the Father, he will also receive from the
      Son. And for this reason he says,
      <b
        >therefore I said that he will receive from me and declare it to you,</b
      >
      for according as he receives from me, so he will show you.<br />

          'A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while,
          and you will see me', and, 'because I go to the Father'?" 18 They
          said, "What does he mean by 'a little while'? We do not know what he
          means." 19 Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him; so he said to them,
          "Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, 'A
          little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and

          sorrow, because her hour has come; but when she is delivered of the
          child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a child [man]
          is born into the world. 22 So you have sorrow now, but I will see you

    <p>
      2116 Above, our Lord explained one reason for their consolation, that was
      his promise of the Holy Spirit. Here he gives the second, which is that
      they will see him again. First, the promise that they will see him again
      is made; secondly, we see the perplexity of the disciples (v 17); and
      thirdly, their perplexity is answered (v 19).
    </p>
    <p>
      2117 When our Lord foretold that he would leave his disciples, he also
      promised that they would see him again. He insists on this several times
      so that by considering the fact that he would come again they might better
      endure his absence. He actually mentions three things to console them: his
      absence will be brief; he will be with them again; and he will leave with
      honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      2118 His absence is brief because
      <b>a little while and you will see me no more,</b> so that the
      <b>little while</b> refers to the time when
      <b>you will see me no more.</b> It is like saying: I will be taken from
      you by death <b>and you will see me no more</b>; but do not be sad,
      because the time during which you will not see me will be a
      <b>little while,</b> for I will rise at dawn, that is, on the third day:
      "Hide yourselves for a little while until the wrath is past" (Is 26:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      2119 Yet I will be with you again because <b>again a little while</b>,
      that is, during a brief time after the resurrection, for forty days,
      "appearing to them during forty days" (Acts 1:3),
      <b>you will see me:</b> "Then the disciples were glad when they saw the
      Lord" (20:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      2120 And this is because I am leaving with honor, because I go to the
      Father: "As they were looking on, he was lifted up" (Acts 1:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      Another interpretation would be that the <b>little while</b> refers to the
      time before Christ's death, so that the meaning is: It will just be a
      <b>little while</b> until I am taken from you, that is, on the morrow:
      "Yet a little while I am with you" (13:33).
      <b>And you will see me no more</b>, that is, in mortal form, because "yet
      a little while, and the world will see me no more," as mortal (14:19); yet
      it will see him at the judgment and coming in majesty. But the disciples
      will see Christ when immortal, after the resurrection, because as we read
      in Acts (10:40): "God... made him manifest, not to all the people but to
      us who were chosen by God as witnesses." And so he adds,
      <b>a little while, and you will see me,</b> for I will remain in death
      only for a little while: "In a moment of indignation I hid my face from
      you for a little while" [Is 54:8].
    </p>
    <p>
      Or this <b>little while</b> and we will see him can refer to the time of
      our entire life until the judgment; and then we will see Christ at the
      judgment and in glory. It is called a "little while" in relation to
      eternity: "For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it
      is past" (Ps 90:4). <b>Because I go to the Father,</b> by my resurrection
      and ascension: "Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this
      world to the Father" (13:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      2121 Now we see the perplexity of the disciples: first, they talk it over
      among themselves; secondly, we see the reason for their perplexity; and
      thirdly, we see their point of view and attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      2122 The disciples questioned one another about the Lord's statement,
      saying, <b>What does he mean by a little while?</b> They show an admirable
      respect for Christ for it was so great that they did not presume to
      question him. The angels do the same: "Who is this that comes from Edom,
      in crimsoned garments from Bozrah" (Is 63:1). And he answers: "It is I who
      am speaking of righteousness and a defender who saves you" [Is 63:1]. We
      see from the words of the disciples that they did not yet have a complete
      understanding of what Christ said, either because they were still sunk in
      sorrow or because the words themselves were obscure: "Are you also still
      without understanding?" (Mt 15:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      2123 The reason for their perplexity was that Christ's statements seemed
      to be incompatible. They understood well enough when he said,
      <b>you will not see me</b>, and <b>because I go to the Father</b>. But
      they were perplexed as to how they could see the same person a little
      while after he had died, for they did not yet know of the resurrection,
      and we read "What man can live and never see death? Who can deliver his
      soul from the power of Sheol?" (Ps 89:48); "No one has been known to
      return from Hades" (Wis 2:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      2124 This is why the disciples say,
      <b>What does he mean by a little while and we will see him?</b>
      <b>We do not know what he means</b>, they reply in an unassuming way. As
      Augustine remarks, when some do not understand the words of Scripture they
      belittle it, preferring their own theories to the authority of Scripture.
      Yet others, when they do not understand, unpretentiously admit their own
      lack of knowledge: "I am... a man who is weak and short-lived, with little
      understanding of judgment and laws" (Wis 9:5).
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" id="_ftnref26">[26]</a> This
      is what the apostles are doing here, for they do not say that Christ was
      wrong or that he said nothing. They ascribe their lack of understanding to
      their own ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      2125 Now their perplexity is revealed. First, it is acknowledged [by
      Christ]; secondly, it is cleared up (v 20); and thirdly Christ presents a
      similar situation (v 21).
    </p>
    <p>
      2126 He does two things about the first. First, he shows how the
      perplexity of the disciples was recognized by Christ, when he says,
      <b>Jesus knew</b>, by reason of his divinity,
      <b>that they wanted to ask him,</b> about this difficulty: "He himself
      knew what was in man" (2:25); "Man looks on the outward appearance, but
      the Lord looks on the heart" (1 Sam 16:7). Then he shows how this
      recognition was expressed in words, when Christ said to them,
      <b>Is this what you are asking yourselves... ?</b> "I made them known;
      then suddenly I did them and they came to pass" (Is 48:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      2127 Now he explains his words and removes the perplexity of the
      disciples, not just repeating what he had said, but setting their minds at
      ease. First, he states that there will be a division of those who are sad
      and those who are joyful; secondly, he mentions their own interior sorrow;
      and thirdly, the joy that will follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      2128 About the first, he says, <b>Truly, truly I say to you</b> that
      during that little while in which you will not see me
      <b>you will weep</b>, groaning aloud in sad tones, and lament, shedding
      tears: "She weeps bitterly in the night," referring to the first, "tears
      on her cheeks" referring to the second (Lam 1:2); "Keep your voice from
      weeping" (Jer 31:16).
    </p>
    <p>
      2129 But their interior sadness will be in contrast to the joy of the
      world. Thus he says, <b>but the world will rejoice.</b> This can be
      understood in a particular way as referring to the time of Christ's
      passion, and then <b>the world,</b> that is, the Scribes and Pharisees,
      <b>will rejoice</b> that Christ is killed: "Ah, this is the day we longed
      for; now we have it; we see it!" (Lam 2:16). Or <b>the world,</b> that is
      the evil members of the Church, will rejoice that the saints are
      persecuted: "The inhabitants of the earth will rejoice" [Rev 17:8]. Or in
      a general sense, <b>the world,</b> those living carnally,
      <b>will rejoice</b> in worldly things: "And behold, joy and gladness,
      slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine" (Is
      22:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      The sorrow of the disciples follows, and so he says,
      <b>you will be sorrowful,</b> because of the sufferings you will have in
      this world, or rather at my being killed. This is the way the saints are
      saddened: by the sufferings they endure at the hands of the world and by
      sin: "For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation" (2
      Cor 7:10).
    </p>
    <p>
      2130 Yet joy will follow this sadness, because your sorrow, which you will
      experience over my passion, will turn into joy, at my resurrection: "The
      disciples were glad when they saw the Lord" (20:20). And in general, the
      sorrow of all the saints will be turned into the joy of the future life:
      "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted" (Mt 5:4); "He
      that goes forth weeping, bearing the seed for sowing, shall come home with
      shouts of joy" (Ps 126:6). For the saints weep as they sow during this
      time of merit, but they will rejoice at the reaping, during the time of
      reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      2131 Now our Lord mentions a similar case and then draws the parallels.
      The similar instance he gives is that of a woman about to give birth.
      First, he mentions the sorrow she has while in labor; and secondly, her
      joy once her child is born (v 21).
    </p>
    <p>
      2132 In regard to the first he says,
      <b>When a woman is in travail she has sorrow</b>, very great sensible
      sorrow, <b>because her hour of pain has come</b>: "Anguish as of a woman
      in travail" (Ps 48:6). We can understand this pain as the pain of the
      passion of Christ, which was the greatest: "Look and see if there is any
      pain like my pain" [Lam 1:12]. We can also see in it the pain of the
      saints when repentant over their sins: "Like a woman with child, who
      writhes and cries out in her pangs, when she is near her time, so were we
      because of you, O Lord" (Is 26:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      2133 Now he mentions the joy when it is over. After a birth there is a
      double joy: one, because the pain is past; the other, and greater, is over
      the birth of the child. This joy is greater if the child is of the male
      sex, since the male is complete, while the female is incomplete and
      fortuitous. "Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, 'A son
      is born to you!"' (Jer 20:15). And in Genesis, when Sara conceived she
      said, "God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with
      me" [Gen 21:6]. So he says,
      <b
        >but when she is delivered of the child, she no longer remembers the
        anguish,</b
      >
      rejoicing that the pain is over, but even more
      <b>for joy that a man is born into the world.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This image is appropriate to Christ because by his suffering he delivered
      us from the anguish of death and gave birth to a new man, that is, he
      conferred on human nature a newness of life and glory which were not yet
      known to us. Thus he does not say, "a child is born," but rather
      <b>a man is born</b>, because Christ, in his human nature, rose from the
      dead, renewed, with the newness of a child at birth. This image also fits
      the Church militant, which walks in a newness of life; and the Church
      triumphant, which walks in a newness of glory. He does not say, "There
      will be no anguish," but
      <b>she no longer remembers the anguish,</b> because even though the saints
      in glory will remember the afflictions they endured, they will not
      experience them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2134 Here he draws the parallels. As regards the present sorrow the
      apostles were experiencing he says, <b>So you have sorrow now</b>, now
      being from the time of my passion, and the sorrow is over my death: "What
      is this conversation which you are holding with each other as you walk and
      look sad?" [Lk 24:17]. Or now, during your entire life, you have sorrow:
      "You will weep and lament" (16:20).
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards their future joy he says, <b>but I will see you again</b>. This
      is the same as if he said "you will see me," because we can see him only
      if he shows himself. Yet he does not say, "You will see me," but
      <b>I will see you</b>, because this showing of himself to us springs from
      his compassion, which the very sight of him indicates. He says,
      <b>I will see you again</b>, at my resurrection and in future glory: "Your
      eyes will see the king in his beauty" (Is 33:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, he promises them a joyful heart and gladness, saying,
      <b>and your hearts will rejoice,</b> when you see me at my resurrection.
      Thus the Church sings: "This is the day the Lord has made: let us rejoice
      and be glad." <b>And your hearts will rejoice</b> at the vision of my
      glory: "Your face will fill me with joy" [Ps 16:11]; "Then you shall see
      and be radiant, your heart shall thrill and rejoice" (Is 60:5). For it is
      natural for each one to rejoice at the sight of what is loved. Now no one
      can see the divine essence unless he loves it: "He shows it to his friend,
      as it is his possession" [Job 36:33]. And so it is necessary that joy
      follow upon this vision: "You shall see," knowing with your mind, "and
      your heart shall rejoice" (Is 66:14). This joy will even spill over on to
      the body when it is glorified, and so Isaiah continues: "Your bones shall
      flourish like the grass"; "Enter into the joy of your master" (Mt 25:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, he promises that this joy will last forever, saying,
      <b>and no one will take your joy from you,</b> that is, the joy you will
      have over my resurrection will not be taken from you, like the Jews took
      your joy during my passion. And this is because "Christ rising from the
      dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him" [Rom
      6:9] Or, your joy in the fullness of your glory
      <b>no one will take from you</b> since it cannot be lost and is
      continuous: "Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads" (Is 35:10). For we
      will not lose this joy for ourselves by sin since our wills shall be fixed
      in the good; and no one can take this joy from us because then there will
      be no violence and no injuries will be inflicted on us, etc.<br />

      2135 Above, our Lord enlarged on two things which would comfort his
      apostles, the promise of the Paraclete and his own return. Here he
      mentions a third reason by which he comforts them, promising them access
      to the Father. First, he promises them an intimate relationship with the
      Father; secondly, he gives a reason for this intimacy (v 25). He does two
      things about the first: he gives them that security that comes from
      confidence; secondly, he encourages them to act on their confidence (v
      24). He does two things with the first: first, he rejects a need for an
      intercessor; secondly, he promises them an opportunity to ask (v 23).
    </p>
    <p>
      2136 He says, <b>In that day you will ask nothing of me</b>. According to
      Augustine, where we have <i>ask</i>, the Greeks have a word which means
      two things: to ask for something, and to ask or pose a question.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" id="_ftnref28">[28]</a>
      Consequently, <b>In that day you will ask nothing of me</b> can mean two
      things: you will not ask me for anything, or you will not question me
      about anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>In that day</b>. What that day is can be seen from what he said before,
      "I will see you again" (v 22). This can be understood to be the day of his
      resurrection, or the day when we have the vision of his glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      2137 Chrysostom understands this passage the first way.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" id="_ftnref29">[29]</a> Thus,
      <b>In that day</b>, when I arise from the dead,
      <b>you will ask nothing of me,</b> that is, you will not say such things
      as "Show us the Father." Augustine objects to this interpretation because
      after the resurrection the disciples did say: "Lord, will you at this time
      restore the kingdom to Israel?" (Acts (1:6); and Peter poses the question:
      "Lord, what about this man?" (20:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet one can uphold Chrysostom's explanation by saying that our Lord calls
      <b>that day</b> not only the day of his resurrection, but also that day
      the disciples were to be taught by the Holy Spirit: "When the Spirit of
      truth comes, he will teach you all truth" [16:13]. And so by speaking in a
      vague manner of that time, our Lord also includes the coming of the Holy
      Spirit. It is like saying: <b>In that day</b>, once the Holy Spirit has
      been given, <b>you will ask nothing of me</b>, because you will know all
      things by the Holy Spirit: "His anointing teaches you about everything" (1
      Jn 2:27). Again, according to Chrysostom, <b>In that day</b>, when the
      Holy Spirits comes, <b>you will ask nothing of me</b>, that is, you will
      have no need to ask me.
    </p>
    <p>
      2138 But after the resurrection did not the apostles pray to Christ for
      things? It seems so, for the Apostle says: "Three times I besought the
      Lord," that is, Christ (2 Cor 12:8). I answer that there are two natures
      in Christ: his human nature, by which he is the mediator between God and
      us (1 Tim 2:5), and his divine nature, by which he is one God with the
      Father. Christ, considered as having a human nature, was not a mediator
      who never united us to God, like some mediators who never unite extremes.
      So, Christ joins us to the Father. Now to join God the Farther and to join
      Christ as God are the same. Thus he says: It is not necessary for you to
      use my mediation as man. Thus,
      <b>In that day you will ask nothing of me</b> as mediator, because you
      will have access to God by yourselves ‑ but you will ask me as God.
      Although Christ intercedes for us, as the Apostle says (Rom 8:34), still
      the Church does not ask him as an intercessor. Thus we do not say,
      "Christ, pray for us"; but we do ask him as God, adhering to him as God by
      faith and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      2139 Augustine explains this passage as referring to the day of the vision
      of glory in this way: <b>In that day</b>, when I see you in glory,
      <b>you will ask nothing of me</b>, that is, you will not ask me for
      anything because there will be nothing left to desire, since all goods
      will be ours in superabundance in our homeland: "You will fill me with joy
      by your face" [Ps 16:11]; and again, "I will be satisfied when your glory
      appears" [Ps 17:15].
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" id="_ftnref30">[30]</a> Also,
      you will ask no questions because you will be filled with the knowledge of
      God: "In your light do we see light" (Ps 36:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      2140 An objection can be raised against both of these points. The saints
      do pray in our homeland: "Call now, if there is any who will answer you;
      and turn to some of the saints" [Job 5:1]; and in 2 Maccabees (15:12) we
      see that a saint prayed for the entire Jewish people. Nor can one say that
      the saints pray just for others and not for themselves, for we read: "O
      Sovereign Lord... how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on
      those who dwell upon the earth?" (Rev 6:10). Further, the saints ask
      questions: for they will be equal to the angels (Mt 22:30), and the angels
      question: "Who is the King of glory?" (Ps 24:8), and "Who is this that
      comes from Edom?" (Is 63:1). Therefore, the saints do question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two points can be made in answer to this. The time of glory can be
      considered in two ways: the time of the beginning of glory, and the time
      of its full completion. The time of the beginning of glory lasts until the
      day of judgment: for the saints receive glory in their soul, but something
      still remains to be received, that is, the glory of the body for each one,
      and the completion of the number of the elect. Consequently, till the day
      of judgment the saints can both ask for things and question, but not about
      what pertains to the very essence of beatitude. The time of fully complete
      glory is after the day of judgment, and after this nothing is left to be
      asked for, and nothing left to be known. It is about this that he says,
      <b>In that day,</b> of consummated glory,
      <b>you will ask nothing of me.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The observation about the angels asking questions is true in his way: they
      do ask about the mysteries of the humanity of Christ and the incarnation,
      but they do not question about the divinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      2141 Now he promises them an opportunity to ask. This is related to the
      above in two ways. According to Chrysostom, this refers to the time of the
      resurrection and the coming of the Holy Spirit.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" id="_ftnref31">[31]</a> It is
      like saying: It is true that in that day of the resurrection and of the
      Holy Spirit that you will not ask me; yet you will have my help, because
      you will ask the Father, to whom you have access through me,
      <b>in my name</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augustine explains it the other way. "In that day," of my glory," you will
      ask nothing of me"; but in the meantime, during your sorrowful pilgrimage,
      <b>if you ask anything of the Father, he will give it to you.</b> So
      according to this explanation,
      <b>if you ask anything of the Father,</b> does not refer to "in that day,"
      but to what precedes that day.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" id="_ftnref32">[32]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      2142 Our Lord lays down seven conditions for good prayer. The first is
      that spiritual goods should be sought, when he says, "
      <b>If you ask anything</b>." For what is entirely earthly, even though it
      is something in itself, is nothing when compared to spiritual goods: "I
      accounted wealth as nothing in comparison with her" (Wis 7:8); "I looked
      on the earth, and lo, it was waste and void" (Jer 4:23). But an objection:
      In Matthew (6:11), our Lord teaches us to ask for temporal goods: "Give us
      this day our daily bread." I answer that a temporal good asked for in
      relation to a spiritual good is then something. The second is that it be
      made with perseverance; as to this he says, <b>If you ask,</b> with
      perseverance: "They ought always to pray and not lose heart" (Lk 18:1);
      "Pray constantly" (1 Thess 5: 17).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, we should pray in harmony with others; he says, <b>if you</b>, in
      the plural, <b>ask</b>: "If two of you agree on earth about anything they
      ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven" (Mt 18:19). Thus the
      Gloss says, about Romans (c 16), that it is impossible for the prayers of
      many not to be heard.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" id="_ftnref33">[33]</a>
      Fourthly, it should arise from an affection like that of a child for its
      parents, as he says, <b>the Father.</b> One who asks out of fear does not
      ask a father, but a master or an enemy: "If you then, who are evil, know
      how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father
      who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!" (Mt 7:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      The fifth condition is that it be made with piety, that is, with humility:
      ‑ "He will regard the prayer of the humble and will not despise their
      petitions" [Ps 102:17] ‑ with confidence that it will be granted ‑ "Let
      him ask in faith, with no doubting" (Jas 1:6) ‑ and it should be made
      correctly ‑ "You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly" (Jas
      4:3). In regard to this he says, <b>in my name</b>, which is the name of
      the Savior, in which name one asks when asking for things pertaining to
      salvation, and when asking in that way by which one can attain salvation:
      "There is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be
      saved" (Acts 4:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      The sixth condition is that prayer be made for an appropriate time, so he
      says, <b>he will give</b>. One should not stop praying if one does not
      immediately receive; it will be given to us even if it is postponed till a
      better time, so as to increase our desire: "You give them their food in
      due season" (Ps 145:15). Seventhly, one should ask for himself. Thus he
      says, <b>to you</b>, because sometimes prayers for others are not heard
      because the demerits of those we ask for stand in the way: "Do not pray
      for this people" (Jer 7:16); "Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet
      my heart would not turn toward this people" (Jer 15:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      2143 Now he encourages them to act with the confidence he has given them:
      first, he reminds them of what they lacked in the past; secondly, he
      encourages them to advance in the future, <b>ask</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      2144 What they lacked in the past was not asking; thus he says,
      <b>Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name</b>. But this seems to
      conflict with Luke (9:1) where it says that Christ gave the twelve "power
      and authority over all demons and to cure diseases"; and the same in
      Matthew (10:1). Now they did these things by praying. Therefore, they did
      ask something in the name of Christ, especially because the disciples
      said: "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name" (Lk 10:17).
    </p>
    <p>
      We must say, then, that this can be explained in two ways. First,
      <b>Hitherto you have asked nothing,</b> that is nothing great,
      <b>in my name</b>. For to ask for cures for the body is a small matter
      compared to the great things they would accomplish by their prayers; nor
      had they yet received the Spirit of adoption to make them aspire to
      spiritual and heavenly things. And if you object that they did ask for
      something great when they asked before, "Lord, show us the Father" (14:8),
      I answer that they were not asking the Father (which is what Christ is
      talking about here), but only Christ as man, trusting that as a mediator
      he would show them the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another explanation:
      <b>if you ask anything of the Father in my name.</b> Up to now they had
      not asked in his name because they did not have a complete knowledge of
      the name of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      2145 When he says, <b>ask, and you will receive</b>, he is urging them to
      make progress, that is, they are now to ask: "Ask, and it will be given
      you" (Mt 7:7). <b>Ask</b>, I say, <b>and you will receive</b>, that is,
      what you are asking for, that your joy may be full: "The seventy returned
      with joy, saying, 'Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name'"
      (Lk 10:17). The phrase <b>that your joy may be full</b> can be taken to
      indicate the reason why their prayers are heard. Or, it can point to what
      they are praying for, so the meaning is: <b>ask, and you will receive</b>,
      and what you should ask for is <b>that your joy may be full.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2146 Note that the object of joy is a good that is desired. Since desire
      is a kind of movement toward a good, and joy is rest in that good, a
      person has joy when he rests in a good, now possessed, to which his desire
      was moved. And one's joy is proportionate to the good possessed. There
      cannot be full joy in a created good because it does not give complete
      rest to man's desires and yearnings. Our joy will be full when we possess
      that good in which all the goods we can desire are found superabundantly.
      This good is solely God "who satisfies our desire with good things" [Ps
      103:5]. Therefore he says, <b>ask</b> this,
      <b>that your joy may be full,</b> that is, ask to enjoy God and the
      Trinity, as Augustine says, and no joy is greater: "You will fill me with
      joy with your face" [Ps 16:11].
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" id="_ftnref34">[34]</a> And
      why is this? Because "all good things came to me along with her," that is,
      with the contemplation of divine wisdom (Wis 7:11).<br />

      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      2147 Above, our Lord promised his disciples an access and intimacy with
      the Father. Now he gives the reason for this intimacy. There are two
      things that make a person intimate with another and foster confidence when
      asking for something: knowledge and love. Thus our Lord gives these two
      reasons here. The first is taken from their clear knowledge of the Father;
      the second, from his special love for them (v 26).
    </p>
    <p>
      2148 He does two things about the first: first, he reminds them of their
      previous imperfect knowledge of the Father; secondly, he promises them
      complete knowledge,
      <b>the hour is coming when I shall no longer speak to you in proverbs.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, their knowledge was imperfect; so he says,
      <b>I have said this to you in proverbs.</b> A proverb, strictly speaking,
      is a maxim, a common expression, as "Train up a child in the way he should
      go, and when he is old he will not depart from it" (Prv 22:6). Now because
      proverbs are sometimes not clear and are metaphorical, the word "proverb"
      is sometimes used to indicate a parable, which states one thing while
      actually meaning something else. This is the case here, and "proverb"
      should be taken to mean parable.
    </p>
    <p>
      2149 The statement, <b>I have said this to you in proverbs,</b> can be
      taken in four ways. The first is literal, and refers to what he had said
      immediately before this. Then the sense is: I said to you that hitherto
      you have asked nothing in my name, and that you will ask in my name, and
      <b>I have said this to you in proverbs,</b> and obscurely. But
      <b>the hour is coming</b> when what I said obscurely I will say plainly.
      Thus he adds: "the Father himself loves you," and "I came from the Father
      and have come into the world." This seems to be the way the apostles
      understood it because when they heard him say these things they said, "Ah,
      now you are speaking plainly, and not in proverbs" (16:29).
    </p>
    <p>
      2150 In the second way, <b>I have said this to you in proverbs,</b> refers
      to everything which is read in this Gospel about the teaching of Christ.
      Then the next statement,
      <b>the hour is coming when I shall no longer speak to you in proverbs,</b>
      would refer to the time of glory. For now we see in a mirror, in an
      obscure manner, since what we are told about God is presented to us in
      proverbs. But in our homeland we will see "face to face," as we read in 1
      Corinthians (13:12). Therefore, we will then be plainly told of the
      Father, and not in proverbs. He says, <b>of the Father</b>, because no one
      can see the Father in that glory unless the Son reveals him: "No one knows
      the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal
      him" (Mt 11:27). For the Son is the true light, and gives us the light by
      which we can see the Father: "I am the light of the world" (8:12).
    </p>
    <p>
      2151 But the next statement,
      <b>in that day you will ask in my name,</b> does not fit this [second]
      explanation. For if that hour is the time of glory, we will not ask for
      anything because our desires will be satisfied with good. Accordingly,
      there are two other meanings. According to Chrysostom the sense is this:
      <b>I have said this to you,</b> that is, what I have just said,
      <b>in proverbs</b>, that is, in veiled language, not entirely expressing
      all that you should know about me and the Father, because "I have yet many
      things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now" (16:12). But
      <b>the hour is coming,</b> that is, when I have arisen from the dead,
      <b>when I shall no longer speak to you in proverbs,</b> that is, obscurely
      and in figures, <b>but tell you plainly of the Father.</b>
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" id="_ftnref35">[35]</a>
      Indeed, during those forty days during which he appeared to them, he
      taught them many mysteries and told many things about himself and the
      Father. Further, they had been raised to higher things by their faith in
      the resurrection, firmly believing that Christ was the true God. So we
      read that Christ was "speaking of the kingdom of God" to them (Acts 1:3),
      and that "He opened their minds to understand the scriptures" (Lk 24:45).
    </p>
    <p>
      2152 The other reading is given by Augustine, and is this.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" id="_ftnref36">[36]</a> When
      Christ said <b>I have said this to you in proverbs</b>, our Lord is
      promising to make them spiritual. There is a difference between one who is
      spiritual and one who is sensual: a sensual person understands spiritual
      words as proverbs, not because they were spoken as proverbs, but because
      the mind of such a person cannot rise above material things, and spiritual
      things are hidden (1 Cor 2:14). But one who is spiritual understands
      spiritual words as spiritual. At the beginning, the disciples themselves
      were sensual, and what was told them they found obscure, and took as
      proverbs. But after they were made spiritual by Christ and had been taught
      by the Holy Spirit, they clearly understood spiritual words as spiritual.
      And so Christ says, <b>I have said this to you in proverbs,</b> that is,
      you understood what I said as proverbs. But
      <b>the hour is coming when I shall no longer speak to you in proverbs:</b>
      "And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are
      being changed into his likeness" (2 Cor 3:18).
    </p>
    <p>
      2153 Now we see the second reason why they should have confidence, and it
      is based on the Father's love for the disciples: first, he shows the
      Father's love for them; secondly, the intimacy of the Father with the Son,
      I came from the Father. He does two things with the first: first, he
      repeats a promise he made to them; secondly, he gives the reason for what
      was promised, <b>for the Father himself loves you.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2154 He does two things with the first: he repeats one of his promises;
      secondly, he promises that they will have confidence when they pray.
    </p>
    <p>
      He says, <b>In that day</b>, when I tell you plainly of the Father,
      <b>you will ask in my name;</b> for when you plainly know the Father you
      will know that I am equal to him and of the same essence, and that it is
      through me that you can approach or have access to him. To have this hope
      of approaching or having access to the Father through Christ is what is
      meant by asking in the name of Christ: "Some trust in chariots, and some
      in horses. But we will call upon the name of the Lord our God" [Ps 20:7].
      But Christ is silent about asking the Father for them; he says,
      <b>I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2155 But doesn't Christ pray for us? Certainly: "We have an advocate with
      the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" (1 Jn 2:1); "He is able for all
      time to save those who draw near to God through him" (Heb 7:25). According
      to Augustine, Christ says this so the disciples will not think that
      Christ, since he is a man, is limited to interceding for them.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" id="_ftnref37">[37]</a> So in
      that day when I tell you plainly, you will not only ask in my name, but
      you will know that I am one with the Father, and not just an intercessor,
      but in addition to interceding, I, as God, will hear your prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Chrysostom, however, Christ probably says this so the
      disciples will not believe that they are to ask through the Son as if they
      could not approach the Father directly.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" id="_ftnref38">[38]</a> He is
      saying in effect: At present you come to me to intercede for you. But in
      that day you will have such confidence in the Father that you will be able
      to ask the Father in my name, without needing another to intercede for
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      2156 But the apostles did need Christ, as man, to intercede, didn't they?
      If not, then since he does intercede, his intercession is superfluous. We
      should say that Christ intercedes for them not as though they were
      strangers and had no access to the Father, but he makes their prayers more
      effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      2157 Here he gives the reason for the promise, which is the Father's love
      for them: and first, he mentions the Father's love; secondly, the proof of
      this love, <b>because you have loved me.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2158 He says:
      <b>I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you,</b> for then
      it might seem that the Father did not love them. Assuredly,
      <b>the Father himself,</b> who loves all things by willing them the goods
      of nature ‑ "For you love all things that exist, and have loathing for
      none of the things which you have made" (Wis 11:26) ‑ loves you, apostles
      and saints, with an exceptional love, by willing you the highest good,
      that is, himself. "He loved his people: all those consecrated to him were
      in his hand" (Deut 33:3), because he loved them that much. "The souls of
      the righteous are in the hand of God" (Wis 3:1).
    </p>
    <p>
      2159 He proves this from two facts, from the love of the disciples for
      Christ, and from their faith. With regard to the first he says,
      <b>because you have loved me</b>. This proof does not give the cause [why
      the Father loves them], for we read, "Not as though we had loved God, but
      because he has first loved us" [1 Jn 4:10]. Rather, it gives a sign [of
      God's love for them], for the fact that we love God is a sign that he
      loves us, for our being able to love God is a gift from God: "God's love
      has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been
      given to us" (Rom 5:5); "He who loves me will be loved by my Father"
      (14:21).
    </p>
    <p>
      Referring to the second he says,
      <b>and have believed that I came from the Father:</b> "Without faith it is
      impossible to please God" [Heb 11:6]. Our faith is due to God's love for
      us, for "it is the gift of God" (Eph 2:8). Now a gift is not given except
      through the love of the giver. To believe in and to love Christ insofar as
      he comes forth from God is a clear sign of one's love for God, since that
      in virtue of which something is such is itself even more so. Therefore,
      when one loves Christ, who came forth from God, this love is particularly
      traced back to God the Father; but this is not so when one loves Christ
      precisely as human.
    </p>
    <p>
      2160 Because he had mentioned his coming forth from the Father, he now
      comments more fully on it, saying, <b>I came</b> <i>(exivi,</i> came
      forth) <b>from the Father and have come</b> <i>(veni)</i>
      <b>into the world.</b> This shows his intimacy with the Father. He first
      mentions his coming forth from the Father; and secondly, his return to the
      Father (v 28).
    </p>
    <p>
      2161 The Son proceeds or comes from the Father in two ways: one is
      eternal, the other temporal. He refers to the eternal procession when he
      says, <b>I came</b> (came forth, <i>exivi)</i> <b>from the Father</b>,
      eternally begotten from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything which comes forth from another was first in it. There are three
      ways one thing can be in something else. First, as what is contained is in
      its container; second, as a part in some whole; thirdly, as an accident in
      its subject and as an effect in its cause. What comes forth is in that
      from which it comes forth in one of these ways. In the first two ways,
      what comes forth remains the same individual it was. For example, what
      comes from the keg is the very same wine that was in the keg; and the very
      same part that was in the whole comes from the whole. In the other two
      ways [the third member] what comes forth is not the same individual. Now
      none of these ways apply to God: for since God is entirely simple, and is
      in some place only metaphorically speaking, we cannot say that the Son is
      in God like some part, or that the Son is contained in a container.
      Rather, the Son is in the Father by a oneness of essence: "I and the
      Father are one" (10:30). For the entire essence of the Father is the
      entire essence of the Son, and vice versa. Consequently, the Son does not
      come forth from the Father in the previously mentioned ways. For when a
      part comes from the whole, it is distinct from the whole in essence: for
      when a part comes from the whole it becomes a being in act, while in the
      whole it was only a being in potency. Likewise, what comes from being
      contained in some container now occupies a different place than it did.
      But the Son does not come forth from the Father to occupy a different
      place because he fills all things, "Do I not fill heaven and earth?" (Jer
      23:24). Nor is the Son split off from the Father because the Father cannot
      be divided. Rather, the Son comes forth by reason of a distinction in
      person. Thus, insofar as the coming forth of the Son presupposes some kind
      of existing in another, this indicates a unity of essence; while insofar
      as there is a certain coming forth, a distinction in person is indicated.
      "His coming forth is from the highest heaven," that is, from God the
      Father [Ps 19:6]; "You are my son, born before the day‑star rises" [Ps
      110:3].
    </p>
    <p>
      In material things, what comes forth from another is no longer in it,
      since it comes from it by a separation from it in place or in essence.
      This is not the kind of coming forth we have here, for the Son came forth
      from the Father from all eternity in such a way that the Son is still in
      the Father from all eternity. And so when the Son is in the Father, he
      comes forth, and when the Son comes forth he is in the Father: so the Son
      is always in the Father and always coming forth from the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      2162 He mentions his temporal coming when he says,
      <b>I have come into the world.</b> Just as the Son's coming forth from the
      Father from eternity does not involve a change of place, neither does his
      coming into the world imply a change of place. Since the Father is in the
      Son and the Son is in the Father, then just as the Father fills all
      things, so does the Son; nor is there any place to go. Thus the Son is
      said to have come into the world because he assumed a human nature, which
      had its origin from the world as far as its body was concerned. But the
      Son did not move to a new place. "He came to his own home, and his own
      people received him not" (1:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      2163 Then when he says,
      <b>again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father,</b> he speaks of
      his return to the Father. First he mentions his leaving the world,
      <b>again, I am leaving the world</b>, but not ceasing to govern us by his
      providence, because he is always governing the world together with the
      Father, and he is always with the faithful by the help of his grace: "I am
      with you always, to the close of the age" (Mt 28:20). Rather, he left the
      world by withdrawing from the physical sight of the worldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, he mentions his return to the Father when he says,
      <b>and going to the Father,</b> whom he had never left. He goes insofar as
      he offered himself to the Father in his passion: "Christ... gave himself
      up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God" (Eph 5:2). Again, he
      goes to the Father insofar as by his resurrection his human nature became
      like the Father in its immortality: "the life he lives he lives to God"
      (Rom 6:10). Further, he goes to the Father by ascending into the heavens
      where he shines in a special way with divine glory: "So then the Lord
      Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down
      at the right hand of God" (Mt 16:19); "But now I am going to him who sent
      me; yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'"<br />

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <b
          >29 His disciples said, "Ah, now you are speaking plainly, not in any
          figure [proverb]! 30 Now we know that you know all things, and need
          none to question you; by this we believe that you came from God." 31
          Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe? 32 The hour is coming,
          indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, every man to his home,
          and will leave me alone; yet I am not alone, for the Father is with
          me. 33 I have said this to you, that in me you may have peace. In the
          world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the
          world."</b
        >
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      2164 After these consoling words spoken to the apostles, we now see their
      effect on them: first, their reaction is given; secondly, we see their
      condition; and thirdly, we see the intention of Christ,
      <b>I have said this to you, that</b>... The reaction of the disciples is a
      profession of faith, <b>Ah, now you are speaking plainly</b>... They
      profess three things about Christ: the clarity of his teaching, the
      certitude of his knowledge, and his divine origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      2165 They profess the clarity of his teaching when they say,
      <b>Now you are speaking plainly, not in any proverb!</b> If we consider
      this with attention we see that there is scarcely any other place in
      sacred scripture where the origin of Christ is so openly expressed as
      here, when he says, "I shall tell you plainly of the Father," and "I came
      forth from the Father and have come into the world." And so believing that
      his promise to tell them plainly of the Father had now been kept so that
      they did not need any further teaching, they say,
      <b>Ah, now you are speaking plainly</b>. As Augustine remarks, the
      disciples were still so lacking in understanding that they did not realize
      they were lacking in understanding.
      <a href="John16.htm#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" id="_ftnref39">[39]</a> For
      Christ had not promised to speak to them without proverbs at that time,
      but at the time of the resurrection or of glory. Yet as far as the
      disciples were concerned, he was now speaking more clearly, although they
      were later to understand his words still more clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      2166 They profess the certainty of his knowledge when they say,
      <b>Now we know that you know all things</b>. At first glance, the meaning
      seems to be that when one clearly explains the things he says, this is a
      proof of his certain and full knowledge of them: for the sign of one who
      knows is the ability to fully teach what he knows ‑ "Knowledge is easy for
      a man of understanding" (Prv 14:6) ‑ and what is beyond one's
      understanding cannot be plainly told in words. Yet the apostles said this
      for another reason, which is because the Lord knew all the secrets of
      their hearts, and could satisfy their perplexities. He consoled them by
      promising them the joy of the Holy Spirit, that they would see him again,
      and that the Father loves them. Thus they say,
      <b>Now we know that you know all things</b>, that is, the secrets of
      hearts: "Lord, you know everything" (21:17); "The Lord God knows all
      things before they are done" [Wis 8:8].
    </p>
    <p>
      2167 Then they add, <b>and need none to question you</b>. This seems to
      contradict what they had just said, namely, that he knows all things; for
      one who is wise is questioned (rather than questioning others). Why then
      is it not necessary to question him? The answer is that they said this to
      indicate that he even knew the secrets of hearts, because even before he
      was questioned he satisfied their perplexity when they were saying to each
      other, "What does he mean by 'a little while'?" (16:18). Nevertheless,
      Christ does ask and is asked, not because he needs it, but because we do.
    </p>
    <p>
      2168 They profess Christ's divine origin when they say,
      <b>by this we believe that you came</b> (came forth, <i>exist</i>)
      <b>from God</b>. This statement is appropriate for it is a distinguishing
      characteristic of the divinity to know all things and even the secrets of
      hearts: "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt;
      who can understand it? 'I the Lord search the mind and try the heart'
      "(Jer 17:9). Thus they say, <b>you came from God</b>, consubstantial with
      the Father, and true God.
    </p>
    <p>
      2169 Now we see the condition of the disciples, which is one of weakness:
      first, Christ reproaches their slowness to believe; secondly, he foretells
      their approaching troubles; thirdly, he shows that he cannot be injured by
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      2170 As to the first he says, <b>Do you now believe?</b> If this is
      understood as a question, it is a rebuke for being so slow to believe. It
      is like saying: Have you waited till now to believe? If we understand this
      remissibly, Christ is reproving the instability of their faith. Then it is
      like saying: It is true that you believe now, but as soon as I am
      betrayed, you will leave me: "They believe for a while and in time of
      temptation fall away" (Lk 8:13).
    </p>
    <p>
      2171
      <b
        >The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered,
        every man to his home, and will leave me alone</b
      >. Here we see their approaching troubles and falling away. Notice that by
      their falling away they lost what they had acquired through Christ. They
      had acquired the companionship of Christ, freedom from the burdens of
      ownership, and a life together. Peter mentions these three things in
      Matthew (19:27): "We," all of us, referring to their life together, "have
      left everything," referring to the freedom from the burdens of ownership,
      "and followed you," referring to their companionship with Christ. They
      lost these things and our Lord foretold this to them when he said:
      <b>The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered</b>
      (referring to their life together), because you will be dominated by such
      fear that you will not be able to run away together, as a group: "Strike
      the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered" (Zech 13:7);
      <b>every man to his home</b> (referring to their lost freedom from
      things), that is, returning to his desire to possess his own things. And
      we do see Peter and the others return to their boat and their own
      property: "They went out and got into the boat" (21:3).
      <b>And will leave me alone,</b> (referring to the loss of Christ's
      companionship): "My kinsfolk and my close friends have failed me; the
      guests in my house have forgotten me" (Job 19:14); "I have trodden the
      wine press alone" (Is 63:3).
    </p>
    <p>
      2172 Yet Christ did not suffer any loss by the falling away of his
      disciples; thus he says,
      <b>yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me</b>. This is like saying:
      Although I am one with the Father by a unity of essence, I am not alone
      because distinct in person. Thus I have not come forth from the Father in
      such a way as to leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      2173 Here our Lord states the purpose of his teaching: first he mentions
      the benefit it brings; secondly, why we need this benefit,
      <b>in the world you have tribulation.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      2174 The benefit his teaching gives is peace. He says to them: I am
      telling you that you will be reduced to leaving me alone; and so I am
      teaching you so you do not continue in this abandonment. Indeed,
      everything I have said to you in this talk and everything I have spoken in
      the entire Gospel is aimed at having you return to me,
      <b>that in me you may have peace</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly, the purpose of the Gospel is peace in Christ: "Those who love your
      name have great peace" [Ps 119:165]. The reason for this is that peace of
      heart is opposed to its disturbance, which comes from the evils that
      afflict it and grow worse. But if one has affliction only now and then, or
      a joy greater than one's evils, his disturbance does not last. This is why
      the worldly, who are not united to God by love, have troubles without
      peace; while the saints, who have God in their hearts by love, have peace
      in Christ even if they have troubles from the world: "He makes peace in
      your borders" [Ps 147:14]. And our purpose here should be to have peace in
      God: "My soul refused to be comforted," with things of the world, "but I
      remembered God and was delighted" [Ps 77:3].
    </p>
    <p>
      2175 We need this peace because of the troubles imposed by the world; so
      Christ says, <b>In the world you have tribulation.</b> First, he foretells
      their future distress; secondly, he gives them confidence to meet it. In
      regard to the first he says,
      <b>In the world you have tribulation,</b> that is, from the worldly: "Do
      not wonder, brethren, that the world hates you" (1 Jn 3:13); "I chose you
      out of the world, therefore the world hates you" (15:19). Referring to the
      second, Christ says,
      <b>but be of good cheer [have confidence], I have overcome the world.</b>
      For Christ does free us: "You delivered me... from choking fire on every
      side" (Si 51:4). He is saying in effect: Return to me and you will have
      peace, for <b>I have overcome the world</b> which is oppressing you.
    </p>
    <p>
      2176 Christ overcame the world, first of all, by taking away the weapons
      it uses to attack us: these are its allurements: "For all that is in the
      world [is] the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of
      life" (1 Jn 2:16). He conquered the allurement of riches by his poverty:
      "I am poor and needy" (Ps 86:1); "The Son of man has nowhere to lay his
      head" (Lk 9:58). Christ overcame the allurement of honors by his humility:
      "Learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart" (Mt 11:29). He
      overcame the lusts of the world by his sufferings and labors: "He...
      became obedient unto death, even death on a cross" (Phil 2:8); "Jesus,
      wearied as he was with his journey, sat down beside the well" (4:6); "I
      have labored from my youth" [Ps 88:16]. Anyone who conquers these,
      conquers the world. And this is what faith does - "This is the victory
      that overcomes the world, our faith" (1 Jn 5:4) ‑ because since faith is
      [the present possession of] the substance, the basic reality, of what we
      hope for, which is spiritual and eternal good, it causes us to disdain
      sensual and passing goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, Christ overcame the world by casting out the ruler of the world:
      "Now shall the ruler of this world be cast out" (12:31); "He disarmed the
      principalities and powers (Col 2:15). This shows us that the devil is also
      to be overcome by us: "Will you play with him as with a bird, or will you
      put him on a leash for your maidens?" (Job 41:5), which understood
      literally means that after the passion of Christ the little boys and young
      handmaids of Christ will make him their plaything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, Christ overcame the world by converting the people of this world
      to himself. The world rebelled by stirring up dissensions through worldly
      people. But Christ drew these to himself: "I, when I am lifted up from the
      earth, will draw all things to myself" [12:32]. Thus it was said: "The
      world has gone after him" (12:19). So, we should not fear its oppression
      because it has been overcome: "Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory
      through our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Cor 15:57).
