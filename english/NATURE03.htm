    <br />
    <p>
      After the determination of the principles of
      <strong>natural things</strong>, namely subject, form and privation,
      Aristotle turns to the determination of the principles of
      <strong>natural science</strong>. What are they? In any science it is
      necessary to know its <strong>subject</strong> and the
      <strong>middle term</strong> through which it demonstrates. Consequently,
      the first thing to be treated in this respect is the
      <strong>subject</strong> of natural science.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3.1 The definition of nature</strong></p>
    <p>
      Since the subject-matter of natural science is mobile being, which is
      equivalent to the world of nature, it is necessary to begin by defining
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the things around us, we say that some are "natural", while others
      are "artificial", or else they are designated in some other way, such as
      they are the result of "chance".
    </p>
    <p>
      We call animals "natural", also plants and elements. What is the common
      note in all these, that is implied in our calling them "natural"? It is
      that they have <strong>within</strong> themselves some
      <strong>principle of motion and rest</strong>, whether this motion is
      growth, or local motion, or qualitative change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artificial things do not have as such a principle of motion within
      themselves, but only that of the natural substances which compose them.
      Thus a car does not move of itself, but by reason of distinct, independent
      parts which compose it, reacting to the combustion of fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      This principle of motion <strong>in</strong> natural things may be either
      <strong>active</strong> or <strong>passive</strong>. Thus fire burns
      actively, while a body attracted by a magnet is moved passively. It is an
      intrinsic ability to act or to be acted upon. Gravitational motion also is
      passive, but comes from active principles:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      For gravity in earth is not a principle ordained to its moving actively,
      but rather that it be moved, since just as other accidents follow upon
      substantial form, so also does place, and consequently being moved to a
      place, not however in such a way as for the natural form to be the mover,
      but the mover is the generator which gives such a form, upon which such a
      motion follows.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Since natural things differ from the non-natural by virtue of having their
      principle of motion <strong>within</strong> themselves, it is possible to
      arrive at the following definition:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Nature</strong> is
      <strong
        >the principle of motion and rest in that in which it is primarily and
        per se and not according to accident.</strong
      >
    </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span>
      "Principle": This principle whence motion originates either actively or
      passively is found in living things when one thing gives birth to or
      generates another. Hence the word "nature" is from the Latin
      <em>nasci, natum</em>, "to be born"; Greek comes from - "to sprout".
      Nature, as form, is sometimes a cause in the active sense of acting on
      another, sometimes in the passive sense of initiating self-motion, as in
      the case of gravity. Matter it is a cause in the passive sense of
      receiving motion, either from the form [natural motion] or from without
      [violent or para/supra-natural motion].
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span> "Of
      motion and rest": Just as nature designates the principle which causes
      something to move to a certain place, as in the case of gravity, so also
      nature is the principle of remaining at rest in its proper place when it
      reaches it.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span> "In that
      in which it is": In distinction from artificial things, like machines,
      which do not have a nature of their own and only have the nature of their
      natural components, nature is <strong>in</strong> natural things.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span>
      "Primarily": Thus in composite things, even though natural, one must
      distinguish between what is generic or remote and what is proper to the
      nature in question. For example, when an animal falls, it is not because
      of its nature as <strong>animal</strong>, but because of the generic
      nature of the <strong>matter</strong> out of which it is composed.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      <span style="font-family: Symbol; text-indent: -0.25in">�</span> "Per se
      and not according to accident": Thus when a doctor cures himself, the
      active principle of his cure is within himself, but only accidentally: The
      patient as patient has within himself only the ability
      <strong>to be cured</strong>, not the active ability to
      <strong>cure</strong>, as a doctor has. In all
      <strong>artificial</strong> things, the active principle is from without,
      as in the case of a house or a table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The existence of nature is not demonstrated, but is self-evident. It is
      plain to the senses that there are many things which have the principle of
      their motion within themselves, i.e. are from nature. To try to prove the
      existence of nature is to try to prove the self-evident by something
      something that is less evident: the more known by the less known. However,
      <strong>what</strong> the nature of each thing is, or
      <strong>what</strong> is the principle of its motion, is not immediately
      clear and evident. Thus we can know that there is a principle of motion
      within something without knowing what it is.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3.2 The different senses of nature</strong></p>
    <p><strong>3.2.1 Matter as nature</strong></p>
    <p>
      For the first natural philosophers, who had not yet arrived at the concept
      of prime matter, the basic matter of all things was some sensible body
      such as fire or air or water. Consequently, since all forms came to matter
      already in existence, they were in the order of accident, as with the
      forms of artificial things. The basic substantial elements might be either
      one or more than one. Empedocles, for example, proposed what became the
      traditional four: air, earth, fire and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only were these material elements the substance of things, but also
      they were perpetual and incorruptible, while the succeeding accidental
      forms they received came and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      This opinion was true in that it considered matter as the subject and a
      constitutive part of natural things, but it was false in considering
      matter the whole substance. For them, there was no natural unit beyond the
      elements.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3.2.2 Form as nature</strong></p>
    <p>
      Actually a thing does not come into being until it receives a certain
      form. It is the form which gives it identity and actuality. We do not call
      something which is only potential by the name of that which is actual; we
      do not call a piece of lumber chair when it is potentially a chair, but
      only when it is actually a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matter is nature, and form is nature, yet the
      <strong>composite</strong> is not properly called nature, since it is the
      product of nature. That is because nature is a principle, and the
      composite is an effect or product of the principles. [Elsewhere in a
      secondary or loose sense, Thomas sometimes uses the word "nature" as
      equivalent to "essence", which is the composite of matter and form.
      Another equivalent word is "substance", which is the composite as the
      subject of accidents.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the idenity of a thing comes more from its act than from its
      potency, the word nature applies more to the <strong>form</strong> than to
      the <strong>matter</strong>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3.3 How natural science differs from mathematics</strong></p>
    <p>
      We have seen in Chapter 1 that while natural science abstracts from matter
      in its individuality, mathematics abstracts from the aspects of matter
      that are proper to the different senses, such as sound, colour, smell and
      hardness.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      It is plain that posterior things are not comprised in the understanding
      of prior things, but conversely: whence the prior may be understood
      without the posterior, and not conversely. Thus it is evident that
      "animal" is prior to "man", and "man" is prior to "this man" {for man is
      in addition to animal, and this man is in addition to man. And because of
      this, "man" is not comprised in the understanding of "animal", nor
      "Socrates" in the understanding of "man"} whence animal may be understood
      without man, and man without Socrates and other individuals. And this is
      to abstract the universal from the particular.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      Likewise among all the accidents which come to substance, first there
      comes to it <strong>quantity</strong>, and then the sensible
      <strong>qualities</strong> and actions and passions and the motions
      following upon sensible qualities. Thus quantity does not comprise in its
      understanding sensible qualities or passions or motions; nevertheless it
      does comprise in its understanding <strong>substance</strong>. Therefore
      quantity may be understood without matter subject to motion and sensible
      qualities, nevertheless not without substance. And therefore such
      quantities and whatever occurs to them are according to understanding
      abstracted from motion and sensible matter, but not from intelligible
      matter, as is stated in <em>Metaphysics</em> VII.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      Since, then, they are so abstracted from motion according to understanding
      that they do not comprise in their understanding sensible matter subject
      to motion, the mathematician is therefore able to abstract them from
      sensible matter. And it makes no difference as to the truth of the
      consideration whether they be considered in this way or that. For although
      they are not abstracted as to their being, nevertheless the
      mathematicians, who abstract them according to understanding, do not lie,
      since they do not assert them to exist outside of sensible matter, for
      this would be a lie. But rather they consider them without considering
      sensible matter, which may be done without untruth --just as one may
      consider "whiteness" without "music", and truly so, even though they
      should co-exist in the same subject. But it would not be a true
      consideration if one should assert that "white" is not "musical".
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      By virtue of the failure to recognize that things which may be
      <strong>understood</strong> apart, i.e. abstracted, do not necessarily
      <strong>exist</strong> apart, the Platonic school conceived of both types
      of abstraction as actual categories of being. According to Plato, in
      addition to individual men, there exists a universal man, called an
      "idea"; likewise, in addition to sensible bodies, there exist mathematical
      bodies devoid of any sensible qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the concept of material body does not involve singular material
      characteristics, it does nevertheless involve universal material
      characteristics, and as such stands for the individual material body --but
      there is no individual body corresponding to a universal body conceived as
      devoid of sensible characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mathematician, whose subject matter is the odd and even, straight and
      curved, number, line and figure etc., defines without motion and matter.
      Not so with the natural scientist: his definitions, such as those of
      flesh, bone, man etc., comprise sensible matter.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3.4 The mixed sciences</strong></p>
    <p>
      The mixed, or intermediate, sciences are those which take their
      <strong>principles</strong> from purely mathematical sciences, and apply
      them to sensible <strong>matter</strong>. For example, perspective (in
      painting or architecture) applies to visual lines what geometry
      demonstrates concerning abstract lines; music applies to sounds what
      arithmetic considers concerning numerical proportions; astronomy applies
      both arithmetic and geometry to the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      These sciences, even though their principles are derived from mathematics,
      nevertheless are considered more natural than mathematical. Why? The
      reason is because things have their determination from their term, and the
      term of these mixed sciences is natural things.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this respect they are the converse of the purely mathematical sciences,
      for these begin from sensible matter and terminate in the abstract. The
      mixed sciences begin from the abstract and terminate in sensible matter.
      Because of this application on the part of the mixed sciences, it is plain
      that the purely mathematical sciences must abstract from sensible matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since, however the mixed sciences are not purely natural, they will
      demonstrate their conclusions by another middle term than the natural
      sciences. Thus, whereas the natural scientist will demonstrate the
      sphericity of the earth from the properties of the matter composing it,
      i.e. by virtue of all its parts tending to the centre, the astronomer will
      do so, for example, from the shape of a lunar eclipse, or from the fact
      that the same stars are not seen from every part of the earth. [Most
      modern physics is "mixed science"].
    </p>
    <p><strong>3.5 Natural science considers both matter and form</strong></p>
    <p>
      Since both matter and form are nature, as principles of motion and rest,
      natural science treats of both. This is in contrast to the first natural
      philosophers who thought of nature primarily in terms of
      <strong>matter</strong>, [and to the tendency of some modern scientists to
      restrict their consideration to the quantifiable or measurable aspect of
      things.]
    </p>
    <p>
      That it is necessary to consider form equally with matter may be seen from
      all the <strong>arts</strong>, where both are considered: the builder
      considers his materials in view of the form of the building; the doctor
      considers medicine in view of the health he wishes to attain. Since the
      arts imitate nature, the same importance of form must be true of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason why natural science considers both form and matter is the
      fact that form is the <strong>end</strong> of matter. In effect, the final
      form intended dictates what will be done to the matter. Thus in the arts,
      the one who designs the form of a ship specifies what the matter shall be.
      The form of the ship induced into the matter is the
      <strong>end</strong> of the construction of the ship; ultimately the
      <strong>use</strong> of the ship determines the form, and the form
      determines the matter.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3.6 The limit of natural science</strong></p>
    <p>
      Natural science considers "nature", "form", "cause" etc. only in so far as
      these exist in matter. To consider them absolutely, i.e. indifferently
      whether they exist in matter or are immaterial, belongs to metaphysics or
      "first philosophy". Aristotle uses the comparison of a doctor and sinews:
      the doctor does not consider the sinew as such {since this belongs to the
      natural scientist} but only in so far as it pertains to health; so the
      natural scientist considers the forms of things only as they are in
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The limit of the consideration of natural science is, therefore, those
      forms which in a certain way are separated from matter, but still have
      their being in matter, namely, rational souls. These are separated in that
      the intellective power is not the act of any corporeal organ, but are in
      matter in that they give natural being to the body they inform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consideration of forms totally separated from matter, however, and
      even of the rational soul in the state of separation from the body,
      pertains to first philosophy.<br />

    <p>
      I desire, before passing on to any other subject, to call your attention
      to the fact that these forces, resistances, moments, figures etc. may be
      considered either in the abstract, dissociated from matter, or in the
      concrete, associated with matter. Hence the properties which belong to
      figures that are merely geometrical and non-material must be modified when
      we fill these figures with matter and therefore give them weight.

      Although there is but one road to science, that to wit, in which we
      proceed from things more known to things less known, from matters more
      manifest to matters more obscure: and universals are principally known to
      us, science springing by reasonings from universals to particulars: still
      the comprehension of universals by the understanding is based upon the
      perception of individual things by the senses.

    <p>
      Let us then examine the kind of knowledge which is handled by exact
      science. If we search the examination papers in physics and natural
      philosophy for the more intelligible questions, we may come across one
      beginning something like this: "An elephant slides down a grassy
      hill-side." The experienced candidate knows that he need not pay much
      attention to this; it is only put in to give an impression of realism. He
      reads on: "The mass of the elephant is two tons." Now we are getting down
      to business; the elephant fades out of the problem and a mass of two tons
      takes its place. What exactly is this two tons, the real subject-matter of
      the problem? It refers to some property or condition which we vaguely
      describe as "ponderosidy" occurring in a particular region of the external
      world. But we shall not get much farther that way; the nature of the
      external world is inscrutable, and we shall only plunge into a quagmire of
      indescribables. Never mind what two tons <strong>refers</strong> to; what
      is it? How has it actually entered in so definite a way into our
      experience? Two tons is the reading of the pointer when the elephant is
      placed on the weighing machine. Let us pass on. "The slope of the hill is
      60 <sup>o</sup>." Now the hill-side fades out of the problem and an angle
      of 60 <sup>o</sup> takes its place. What is 60 <sup>o</sup> ? There is no
      need to struggle with mystical conceptions of direction; 60
      <sup>o</sup> is the reading of a plumb-line against the divisions of a
      protractor. Similarly for other data of the problem. The softly yielding
      turf on which the elephant slid is replaced by a coefficient of friction,
      which, though perhaps not directly a pointer reading, is of a kindred
      nature. No doubt there are more round-about ways used in practice for
      determining the weights of elephants and the slopes of hills, but these
      are justified because it is known that they give the same results as
      direct pointer readings.

    <p>
      Minerals, like all matter, are made up of elements. At present, more than
      100 elements are known, a dozen of which have been produced only in the
      laboratory. Some minerals like gold are made entirely of one element, but
      most are a combination of two or more elements joined chemically to form a
      compound.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to better understand how elements combine into compounds, we will
      first consider the smallest part of matter that still retains the
      characteristics of an element {the atom} because it is this extremely
      small particle that does the combining. Each atom has a central region,
      called the nucleus, which contains very dense positively charged protons
      and neutral particles called neutrons. The number of protons determines
      the atomic number and name of the element. For example, all atoms with six
      protons are carbon atoms, all those with eight protons are oxygen atoms,
      and so forth. Orbiting the nucleus are negatively charged particles called
      electrons, which are equal in number to the protons. As a result, the
      opposite charges of an atom balance each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an atom combines chemically, it either gains, loses, or shares
      electrons with another atom....
    </p>
    <p>
      In ordinary atoms the electrons circle the nucleus at distances
      proportinal to the orbits of the planets around the sun. Thus, like our
      solar system, atoms are made up mostly of empty space.
