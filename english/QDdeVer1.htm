  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It seems that the true is exactly the same as being, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Augustine says: “The true is ”that which is.” But that which is, is
    simply being. The true, therefore, means exactly the same as being.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. It was said in reply that the true and being are the same materially but
    differ formally.—On the contrary the nature of a thing is signified by its
    definition; and the definition of the true, according to Augustine, is that
    which is.” He rejects all other definitions. Now, since the true and being
    are materially the same, it seems that they are also formally the same.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Things which differ conceptually are so related to each other that one of
    them can be understood without the other. For this reason, Boethius says
    that the existence of God can be understood if for a moment we mentally
    separate His goodness from His existence. Being, however can in no way be
    understood apart from the true, for being is known only in so far as it is
    true. Therefore, the true and being do not differ conceptually.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. If the true is not the same as being, it must be a state of being. But it
    cannot be a state of being. It is not a state that entirely
    corrupts—otherwise, this would follow: “It is true. Therefore, it is
    non-being”—as it follows when we say: “This man is dead. Therefore, this is
    not a man.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Similarly, the true is not a state that limits. If it were, one could not
    say: “It is true. Therefore it is.” For one cannot say that a thing is white
    simply because it has white teeth. Finally, the true is not a state which
    contracts or specifies being, for it is convertible with being. It follows,
    therefore, that the true and being are entirely the same.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Things in the same state are the same. But the true and being are in the
    same state. Therefore, they are the same. For Aristotle writes: “The state
    of a thing in its act of existence is the same as its state in truth.”
    Therefore, the true and being are entirely the same.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. Thing not the same differ in some respect. But the true and being differ
    in no respect. They do not differ essentially, for every being is true by
    its very essence. And they do not differ in any other ways, for they must
    belong to some common genus. Therefore, they are entirely the same.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. If they were not entirely the same, the true would add something to
    being. But the true adds nothing to being, even though it has greater
    extension than being. This is borne out by the statement of the Philosopher
    that we define the true as: “That which affirms the existence of what is,
    and denies the existence of what is not.” Consequently, the true includes
    both being and non-being; since it does not add anything to being, it seems
    to be entirely the same as being.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Useless repetition of the same thing is meaningless; so, if the true were
    the same as being, it would be meaningless to say: “Being is true.” This,
    however, is hardly correct. Therefore, they are not the same.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Being and the good are convertible. The true and the good, however, are
    not interchangeable, for some things, such as fornication, are true but not
    good. The true, therefore, and being are not interchangeable. And so they
    are not the same.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. In all creatures, as Boethius has pointed out, “to be is other than that
    which is.” Now, the true signifies the existence of things. Consequently, in
    creatures it is different from that which is. But that which is, is the same
    as being. Therefore, in creatures the true is different from being.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Things related as before and after must differ. But the true and being
    are related in the aforesaid manner; for, as is said in <i>The Causes</i>:
    “The first of all created things is the act of existence.” In a study of
    this work, a commentator writes as follows: “Everything else is predicated
    as a specification of being.” Consequently, everything else comes after
    being. Therefore, the true and being are not the same.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. What are predicated of a cause and of the effects of the cause are more
    united in the cause than in its effects—and more so in God than in
    creatures. But in God four predicates—being, the one, the true, and the
    good—are appropriated as follows: being, to the essence; the one, to the
    Father; the true, to the Son; and the good, to the Holy Spirit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Since the divine Persons are really and not merely conceptually distinct,
    these notions cannot be predicated of each other; if really distinct when
    verified of the divine Persons, the four notions in question are much more
    so when verified of creatures.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    When investigating the nature of anything, one should make the same kind of
    analysis as he makes when he reduces a proposition to certain self-evident
    principles. Otherwise, both types of knowledge will become involved in an
    infinite regress, and science and our knowledge of things will perish.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Now, as Avicenna says, that which the intellect first conceives as, in a
    way, the most evident, and to which it reduces all its concepts, is being.
    Consequently, all the other conceptions of the intellect are had by
    additions to being. But nothing can be added to being as though it were
    something not included in being—in the way that a difference is added to a
    genus or an accident to a subject—for every reality is essentially a being.
    The Philosopher has shown this by proving that being cannot be a genus. Yet,
    in this sense, some predicates may be said to add to being inasmuch as they
    express a mode of being not expressed by the term <i>being.</i> This happens
    in two ways.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    First, the mode expressed is a certain special manner of being; for there
    are different grades of being according to which we speak when we speak of
    different levels of existence, and according to these grades different
    things are classified. Consequently, <i>substance</i> does not add a
    difference to being by signifying some reality added to it, but
    <i>substance</i> simply expresses a special manner of existing, namely, as a
    being in itself. The same is true of the other classes of existents.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Second. some are said to add to being because the mode they express is one
    that is common, and consequent upon every being. This mode can be taken in
    two ways: first, in so far as it follows upon every being considered
    absolutely; second, in so far as it follows upon every being considered in
    relation to another. In the first, the term is used in two ways, because it
    expresses something in the being either affirmatively or negatively. We can,
    however, find nothing that can be predicated of every being affirmatively
    and, at the same time, absolutely, with the exception of its essence by
    which the being is said to be. To express this, the term <i>thing</i> is
    used; for, according to Avicenna, ”thing differs from being because being
    gets its name from to-be, but thing expresses the quiddity or essence of the
    being.” There is, however, a negation consequent upon every being considered
    absolutely: its undividedness, and this is expressed by <i>one.</i> For the
    <i>one</i> is simply undivided being.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    If the mode of being is taken in the second way—according to the relation of
    one being to another—we find a twofold use. The first is based on the
    distinction of one being from another, and this distinctness is expressed by
    the word <i>something,</i> which implies, as it were,
    <i>some other thing.</i> For, just as a being is said to be <i>one</i> in so
    far as it is without division in itself, so it is said to be
    <i>something</i> in so far as it is divided from others. The second division
    is based on the correspondence one being has with another. This is possible
    only if there is something which is such that it agrees with every being.
    Such a being is the soul, which, as is said in <i>The Soul,</i> “in some way
    is all things.” The soul, however, has both knowing and appetitive powers.
    <i>Good</i> expresses the correspondence of being to the appetitive power,
    for, and so we note in the <i>Ethics,</i> the good is “that which all
    desire.” <i>True</i> expresses the correspondence of being to the knowing
    power, for all knowing is produced by an assimilation of the knower to the
    thing known, so that assimilation is said to be the cause of knowledge.
    Similarly, the sense of sight knows a color by being informed with a species
    of the color.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The first reference of being to the intellect, therefore, consists in its
    agreement with the intellect. This agreement is called “the conformity of
    thing and intellect.” In this conformity is fulfilled the formal constituent
    of the true, and this is what <i>the true</i> adds to being, namely, the
    conformity or equation of thing and intellect. As we said, the knowledge of
    a thing is a consequence of this conformity; therefore, it is an effect of
    truth, even though the fact that the thing is a being is prior to its truth.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Consequently, truth or the true has been defined in three ways. First of
    all, it is defined according to that which precedes truth and is the basis
    of truth. This is why Augustine writes: “The true is that which is”; and
    Avicenna: “The truth of each thing is a property of the act of being which
    has been established for it.” Still others say: “The true is the
    undividedness of the act of existence from that which is.” Truth is also
    defined in another way—according to that in which its intelligible
    determination is formally completed. Thus, Isaac writes: “Truth is the
    conformity of thing and intellect”; and Anselm: “Truth is a rectitude
    perceptible only by the mind.” This rectitude, of course, is said to be
    based on some conformity. The Philosopher says that in defining truth we say
    that truth is had when one affirms that “to be which is, and that not to be
    which is not.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The third way of defining truth is according to the effect following upon
    it. Thus, Hilary says that the true is that which manifests and proclaims
    existence. And Augustine says: “Truth is that by which that which is, is
    shown”; and also: “Truth is that according to which we, judge about inferior
    things.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. That definition of Augustine is given for the true as it has its
    foundation in reality and not as its formal nature is given complete
    expression by conformity of thing and intellect. An alternative answer would
    be that in the statement, “The true is that which is,” the word <i>is</i> is
    not here understood as referring to the act of existing, but rather as the
    mark of the intellectual act of judging, signifying, that is, the
    affirmation of a proposition. The meaning would then be this: “The true is
    that which is—it is had when the existence of what is, is affirmed.” If this
    is its meaning, then Augustine’s definition agrees with that of the
    Philosopher mentioned above.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. The answer is clear from what has been said.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. “Something can be understood without another” can be taken in two ways.
    It can mean that something can be known while another remains unknown. Taken
    in this way, it is true that things which differ conceptually are such that
    one can be understood without the other. But there is another way that a
    thing can be understood without another: when it is known even though the
    other does not exist. Taken in this sense, being cannot be known without the
    true, for it cannot be known unless it agrees with or conforms to intellect,
    It is not necessary, however, that everyone who understands the formal
    notion of being should also understand the formal notion of the true—just as
    not everyone who understands being understands the agent intellect, even
    though nothing can be known without the agent intellect.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. The true is a state of being even though it does not add any reality to
    being or express any special mode of existence. It is rather something that
    is generally found in every being, although it is not expressed by the word
    <i>being.</i> Consequently, it is not a state that corrupts, limits, or
    contracts.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. In this objection, <i>condition</i> should not be understood as belonging
    to the genus of quality. It implies, rather, a certain order; for those
    which are the cause of the existence of other things are themselves beings
    most completely, and those which are the cause of the truth of other things
    are themselves true most completely. It is for this reason that the
    Philosopher concludes that the rank of a thing in its existence corresponds
    to its rank in truth, so that when one finds that which is most fully being,
    he finds there also that which is most fully true. But this does not mean
    that being and the true are the same in concept. It means simply that in the
    degree in which a thing has being, in that degree it is capable of being
    proportioned to intellect. Consequently, the true is dependent upon the
    formal character of being.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. There is a conceptual difference between the true and being since there
    is something in the notion of the true that is not in the concept of the
    existing—not in such a way, however, that there is something in the concept
    of being which is not in the concept of the true. They do not differ
    essentially nor are they distinguished from one another by opposing
    differences.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. The true does not have a wider extension than being. Being is, in some
    way, predicated of non-being in so far as non-being is apprehended by the
    intellect. For, as the Philosopher says, the negation or the privation of
    being may, in a sense, be called being. Avicenna supports this by pointing
    out that one can form propositions only of beings, for that about which a
    proposition is formed must be apprehended by the intellect. Consequently, it
    is clear that everything true is being in some way.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Contrary Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. The reason why it is not tautological to call a being true is that
    something is expressed by the word <i>true</i> that is not expressed by the
    word <i>being,</i> and not that the two differ in reality.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Although fornication is evil, it possesses some being and can conform to
    intellect. Accordingly, the formal character of the true is found here. So
    it is clear that <i>true</i> is coextensive with <i>being.</i>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. In the statement, “To be is other than that which is,” the act of being
    is distinguished from that to which that act belongs. But the name of being
    is taken from the act of existence, not from that whose act it is. Hence,
    the argument does not follow.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. The true comes after being in this respect, that the notion of the true
    differs from that of being in the manner we have described. This argument
    has three flaws. First, although the Persons are really distinct, the things
    appropriated to each Person are only conceptually, and not really, distinct.
    Secondly, although the Persons are really distinct from each other, they are
    not really distinct from the essence; so, truth appropriated to the Person
    of the Son is not distinct from the act of existence He possesses through
    the divine essence. Thirdly, although being, the true, the one, and the good
    are more united in God than they are in created things, it does not follow
    from the fact that they are conceptually distinct in God that they are
    really distinct in created beings. This line of argument is valid only when
    it is applied to things which are not by their very nature one in reality,
    as wisdom and power, which, although one in God, are distinct in creatures.
    But being, the true, the one, and the good are such that by their very
    nature they are one in reality. Therefore, no matter where they are found,
    they are really one. Their unity in God, however, is more perfect than their
    unity in creatures.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It seems that it is found principally in things, for:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. It was pointed out that the true is convertible with being. But being
        is found more principally in things than in the soul. The true,
        therefore, is principally outside the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Things are not in the soul through their essences but, as pointed out
        by the Philosopher, through species. If, therefore, truth is found
        principally in the soul, truth will not be the essence of a thing but
        merely its likeness or species; and the true will be the species of a
        being existing outside the soul. But the species of a thing existing in
        the soul is not predicated of a thing outside the soul and is not
        convertible with it; for, if this were so, the true could not be
        converted with being—which is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That which is in something is based upon that in which it is. If
        truth, then, is principally in the soul, judgments about truth will have
        as their criterion the soul’s estimation. This would revive that error
        of the ancient philosophers who said that any opinion a person has in
        his intellect is true and that two contradictories can be true at the
        same time. This, of course, is absurd.

        4. If truth is principally in the intellect, anything which pertains to
        the intellect should be included in the definition of truth. Augustine,
        however, sharply criticizes such definitions, as, for example, “The true
        is that which is as it is seen.” For, according to this definition,
        something would not be true if it were not seen. This is clearly false
        of rocks hidden deep in the earth. Augustine similarly criticizes the
        following definition: “The true is that which is as it appears to the
        knower, provided he is willing and able to know.” For, according to this
        definition, something would not be true unless the knower wished and
        were able to know. The same criticism can be leveled against other
        definitions that include any reference to intellect. Truth, therefore,
        is not principally in the intellect.

        When a predicate is used primarily and secondarily of many things, it is
        not necessary that that which is the cause of the others receive the
        primary predication of the common term, but rather that in which the
        meaning of the common term is first fully verified. For example,
        <i>healthy</i> is primarily predicated of an animal, for it is in an
        animal that the nature of health is first found in its fullest sense.
        But inasmuch as medicine causes health, it is also said to be healthy.
        Therefore, since truth is predicated of many things in a primary and a
        secondary sense, it ought to be primarily predicated of that in which
        its full meaning is primarily found.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, the fulfillment of any motion is found in the term of the, motion;
        and, since the term of the motion of a cognitive power is, the soul, the
        known must be in the knower after the manner of the knower. But the
        motion of an appetitive power terminates in things. For this reason the
        Philosopher speaks of a sort of circle formed by the acts of the soul:
        for a thing outside the soul moves the intellect, and the thing known
        moves the appetite, which tends to reach the things from which the
        motion originally started. Since good, as mentioned previously,
        expresses a relation to appetite, and true, a relation to the intellect,
        the Philosopher says that good and evil are in things, but true and
        false are in the mind. A thing is not called true, however, unless it
        conforms to an intellect. The true, therefore, is found secondarily in
        things and primarily in intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Note, however, that a thing is referred differently to the practical
        intellect than it is to the speculative intellect. Sine the practical
        intellect causes things, it is a measure of what it causes. But, since
        the speculative intellect is receptive in regard to things, it is, in a
        certain sense, moved by things and consequently measured by them. It is
        clear, therefore, that, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, natural
        things from which our intellect gets its scientific knowledge measure
        our intellect. Yet these things are themselves measured by the divine
        intellect, in which are all created things—just as all works of art find
        their origin in the intellect of an artist. The divine intellect,
        therefore, measures and is not measured; a natural thing both measures
        and is measured; but our intellect is measured, and measures only
        artifacts, not natural things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A natural thing, therefore, being placed between two intellects is
        called <i>true</i> in so far as it conforms to either. It is said to be
        true with respect to its conformity with the divine intellect in so far
        as it fulfills the end to which it was ordained by the divine intellect.
        This is clear from the writings of Anselm and Augustine, as well as from
        the definition of Avicenna, previously cited: “The truth of anything is
        a property of the act of being which has been established for it.” With
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        respect to its conformity with a human intellect, a thing is said to be
        true in so far as it is such as to cause a true estimate about itself;
        and a thing is said to be false if, as Aristotle says, “by nature it is
        such that it seems to be what it is not, or seems to possess qualities
        which it does not possess.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In a natural thing, truth is found especially in the first, rather than
        in the second, sense; for its reference to the divine intellect comes
        before its reference to a human intellect. Even if there were no human
        intellects, things could be said to be true because of their relation to
        the divine intellect. But if, by an impossible supposition, intellect
        did not exist and things did continue to exist, then the essentials of
        truth would in no way remain.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As is clear from the discussion, true is predicated primarily of a
        true intellect and secondarily of a thing conformed with intellect. True
        taken in either sense, however, is interchangeable with being, but in
        different ways. Used of things, it can be interchanged with being
        through a judgment asserting merely material identity, for every being
        is conformed with the divine intellect and can be conformed with a human
        intellect. The converse of this is also true.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But if <i>true</i> is understood as used of the intellect, then it can
        be converted with being outside the soul—not as denominating the same
        subject, but as expressing conformity. For every true act of
        understanding is referred to a being, and every being corresponds to a
        true act of understanding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

        first.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. What is in another does not depend on that other unless it is caused
        by the principles of that other. For example, even though light is in
        the air, it is caused by something extrinsic, the sun; and it is based
        on the motion of the sun rather than on air. In the same way, truth
        which is in the soul but caused by things does not depend on what one
        thinks but on the existence of things. For from the fact that a thing is
        or is not, a statement or an intellect is said to be true or false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Augustine is speaking of a thing’s being seen by the human intellect.
        Truth, of course, does not depend on this, for many things exist that
        are not known by our intellects. There is nothing, however, that the
        divine intellect does not actually know, and nothing that the human
        intellect does not know potentially, for the agent intellect is said to
        be that “by which we make all things knowable,” and the possible
        intellect, as that “by which we become all things.” For this reason, one
        can place in the definition of a true thing its actually being seen by
        the divine intellect, but not its being seen by a human intellect,
        except potentially, as is clear from our earlier discussion.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

        Just as the true is found primarily in the intellect rather than in
        things, so also is it found primarily in an act of the intellect joining
        and separating, rather than in an act by which it forms the quiddities
        of things. For the nature of the true consists in a conformity of thing
        and intellect. Nothing becomes conformed with itself, but conformity
        requires distinct terms. Consequently, the nature of truth is first
        found in the intellect when the intellect begins to possess something
        proper to itself, not possessed by the thing outside the soul, yet
        corresponding to it, so that between the two—intellect and thing—a
        conformity may be found. In forming the quiddities of things, the
        intellect merely has a likeness of a thing existing outside the soul, as
        a sense has a likeness when it receives the species of a sensible thing.
        But when the intellect begins to judge about the thing it has
        apprehended, then its judgment is something proper to itself—not
        something found outside in the thing. And the judgment is said to be
        true when it conforms to the external reality. Moreover, the intellect
        judges about the thing it has apprehended at the moment when it says
        that something is or is not. This is the role of “the intellect
        composing and dividing.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For these reasons, the Philosopher says that composition and division
        are in the intellect, and not in things. Moreover, this is why truth is
        found primarily in the joining and separating by the intellect, and only
        secondarily in its formation of the quiddities of things or definitions,
        for a definition is called true or false because of a true or false
        combination. For it may happen that a definition will be applied to
        something to which it does not belong, as when the definition of a
        circle is assigned to a triangle. Sometimes, too, the parts of a
        definition cannot be reconciled, as happens when one defines a thing as
        “an animal entirely without the power of sensing.” The judgment implied
        in such a definition—“some animal is incapable of sensing”—is false.
        Consequently, a definition is said to be true or false only because of
        its relation to a judgment, as a thing is said to be true because of its
        relation to intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From our discussion, then, it is clear that the true is predicated,
        first of all, of joining and separating by the intellect; second, of the
        definitions of things in so far as they imply a true or a false
        judgment. Third, the true may be predicated of things in so far as they
        are conformed with the divine intellect or in so far as, by their very
        nature, they can be conformed with human intellects. Fourth, true or
        false may be predicated of man in so far as he chooses to express truth,
        or in so far as he gives a true or false impression of himself or of
        others by his words and actions; for truth can be predicated of words in
        the same way as it can be predicated of the ideas which they convey.

        1. Although the formation of a quiddity is the first operation of the
        intellect, by it the intellect does not yet possess anything that,
        properly speaking, is its own and can be conformed to the thing. Truth,

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Anselm says that the relation of truth to all true things is like
        that of time to all temporal things. But there is only one time to which
        all temporal things are related. Therefore there will be only one truth
        to which all true things are related.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. But it was said that truth is used in two ways. In one, it means the
        entity of a thing, as when Augustine says: “The true is that which is.”
        If truth be understood in this sense, then there should be as many
        truths as there are essences of things. In the second way in which truth
        is used, it signifies truth as it is expressed in the intellect.
        Consequently, Hilary writes: “The true affirms existence.” But since
        nothing can manifest anything to the intellect except in virtue of the
        first divine truth, all truths are, in some sense, one, inasmuch as they
        all move the intellect—just as colors are one in moving the sense of
        sight, since they all move it because of one thing: light.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        On the contrary, however, time, the measure of all temporal things, is
        numerically one; and if truth is related to true things as time is
        related to temporal things, the truth of all true things must also be
        numerically one. It will not be sufficient for all truths to be one in
        their action of moving the intellect or to be one in their exemplary
        cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Anselm argues as follows: If there are as many truths as there are
        true things, then truths should change as true things change. But truths
        do not change with the changes of true things, for, even when true and
        correct things are destroyed, the truth and correctness by which they
        are true or correct remain. There is, therefore, only one truth. He
        proves the minor from this: When a sign is destroyed, the correctness of
        the signification remains, for it remains correct that the sign should
        signify that which it did signify. For the same reason, rectitude or
        truth remains even when a true or correct thing has been destroyed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. With regard to created things, nothing is identical with that whose
        truth it is. The truth of a man is not the man; the truth of flesh is
        not the flesh. But every created thing is true. No created thing,
        therefore, is truth. Consequently, every truth is uncreated, and so
        there is only one truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. As Augustine says, only God is greater than the human mind. But, as
        he proves elsewhere, truth is greater than the human mind, for truth
        certainly cannot be said to be less than the human mind. If this were
        so, it would be within the competence of the mind to pass judgment on
        truth. This, of course, is false, for the mind does not judge truth but
        judges according to the truth, like a magistrate who does not pass
        judgment upon the law but, as Augustine himself says, judges according
        to the law. Similarly, the mind of man cannot be said to be equal to
        truth, for it judges everything according to truth. It does not judge
        everything according to itself. Truth, therefore, must be God Alone, and
        so there is only one truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Augustine has proved that truth is not perceived by any bodily sense.
        His proof is that nothing is perceived by sense unless it is changeable.
        But truth is unchangeable. Truth, therefore, is not perceived by sense.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        One could similarly argue that everything created is changeable. But
        truth is not changeable. Therefore, it is not a creature but is
        something uncreated. Consequently, there is only one truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Augustine offers another proof in the same place: “There is no
        sensible thing that does not have some similarity to what is false, and,
        as a result, the two cannot be distinguished. To mention only one
        example: all that we sense through the body. Even when these objects are
        not present to the senses, we experience their images as though they
        were present, as when we are asleep or become delirious.” Truth,
        however, has no resemblance to what is false. Therefore, truth is not
        perceived by a sense.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        One could similarly argue that every created thing has some similarity
        to what is false in so far as it has some defect. Nothing created,
        therefore, is truth, and so there is only one truth.

        1. Augustine writes: “As likeness is the form of like things, so truth
        is the form of true things.” But for many like things there are many
        likenesses. Therefore, for many true things there are many truths.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Just as every created truth is derived from the uncreated truth as
        its model, and has its truth from it, so all intelligible light is
        derived from the first uncreated light as from its exemplary cause, and
        from it possesses its power of making things known. But we say that
        there are many intelligible lights, as is clear from the writings of
        Dionysius. Therefore, following this analogy, it seems we must likewise
        simply concede that there are many truths.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although all colors are able to affect the sense of sight in virtue
        of light, nevertheless, in themselves colors are distinct and different,
        and cannot be said to be one, except from a particular point of view.
        Consequently, even though all created truths manifest themselves in the
        intellect by virtue of the first truth, we cannot for this reason say
        that there is one truth, unless considered under this one aspect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Just as a created truth can manifest itself to the intellect only by
        virtue of the uncreated truth, so no power in a creature can act except
        by virtue of the uncreated power. Yet we do not say that somehow or
        other there is one power for all powers; so, in the same manner, we
        should not say that in some way there is one truth for all truths.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. God as a cause is related to things in three ways: as an efficient,
        an exemplary, and as a final cause. Consequently, by a kind of
        appropriation, the entity of things is referred to God as efficient
        cause, their truth to Him as an exemplary cause, their goodness to Him
        as a final cause—even though, properly speaking, each single one could
        be referred to each single cause. But in no manner of speaking do we say
        that there is one goodness for all good things, or one entity for all
        beings. Therefore, we should not say that there is one truth for all
        true things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Although there is one uncreated truth from which all created truths
        take their model, these truths are not modeled on it in the same way.
        For while it is true that the uncreated truth has the same relation to
        all, all do not have the same relation to it—as pointed out in
        <i>The Causes.</i> Necessary and contingent truths are modeled on the
        uncreated truth in quite different ways. But different ways of imitating
        the divine model cause diversity among created things. Consequently,
        there are many created truths.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Truth is “the conformity of thing and intellect.” But since things
        differ specifically, there cannot be a single conformity to the
        intellect. So, since true things are specifically different, there
        cannot be one truth for all true things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Augustine writes as follows: “One must believe that the nature of the
        human mind is so connected with intelligible things that it gazes upon
        all it knows by means of a unique light.” Now, the light by whose means
        the soul knows all things is truth. Truth, therefore, belongs to the
        same genus as the soul and must be a created thing. Consequently, in
        different creatures there are different truths.

        From our previous discussion it is clear that truth is properly found in
        the human or divine intellect, as health is found in an animal. In
        things, however, truth is found because of some relation to
        intellect—just as health is said to be in things other than animals in
        so far as they bring about or preserve animal health. Truth, therefore,
        is properly and primarily in the divine intellect. In the human
        intellect, it exists properly but secondarily, for it exists there only
        because of a relation to either one of the two truths just mentioned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In his gloss on these words of Psalm 11 (v. 2), “Truths are decayed from
        among the children of men,” Augustine writes” that the truth of the
        divine intellect is one, and from it are drawn the many truths that are
        in the human intellect—“just as from one man’s face many likenesses are
        reflected in a mirror.” Now, there are many truths in things, just as
        there are many entities of things. But truth predicated of things
        because of their relation to the human intellect is, as it were,
        accidental to those things; for, supposing that the human intellect did
        not or could not exist, things would still remain essentially the same.
        But truth predicated of things because of their relation to the divine
        intellect is inseparably attendant on them, for they cannot exist except
        by reason of the divine intellect which keeps bringing them into being.
        Again, truth is primarily in a thing because of its relation to the
        divine intellect, not to the human intellect, because it is related to
        the divine intellect as to its cause, but to the human intellect as to
        its effect in the sense that the latter receives its knowledge from
        things. For this reason, a thing is said to be true principally because
        of its order to the truth of the divine intellect rather than because of
        its relation to the truth of a human intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        So, if truth in its proper sense be taken as that by which all things
        are primarily true, then all things are true by means of one truth, the
        truth of the divine intellect. This is the truth which Anselm writes
        about. But if truth in its proper sense be taken as that by which things
        are said to be true secondarily, then there are many truths about many
        true things, and even many truths in different minds about one true
        thing. Finally, if truth in its improper sense be taken as that by which
        all things are said to be true, then there are many truths for many true
        things, but only one truth for one true thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Things are called true from the truth in the divine or human intellect,
        just as food is called healthy, not because of any inherent form, but
        because of the health which is in an animal. If, however, a thing is
        called true because of the truth in the thing, which is simply its
        entity conformed with intellect, then it is so called because of
        something inhering in it after the manner of a form, as food is said to
        be healthy because of a quality of its own—which is the reason for its
        being said to be healthy.

        1. Time is related to temporal things as a measure is related to the
        measured. It is clear, therefore, that Anselm is referring to that truth
        which is only the measure of all true things. There is only one such
        truth numerically, just as there is only one time—as the second argument
        concludes. However, the truth in the human intellect or in things
        themselves is not related to things as an extrinsic or common measure is
        related to those it measures. It is related as a measured thing is
        related to a measure, for such is the relation of truth in a human
        intellect to things, and it must, as a consequence, vary as things vary.
        Or, it is related as an intrinsic measure to the thing itself, as is the
        case with the truth that is in things themselves. Intrinsic measures
        must be multiplied as the number of things measured is multiplied—just
        as dimensions must be multiplied with the multiplicity of bodies.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

        3. The truth which remains after things are destroyed is the truth of
        the divine intellect, and this is numerically one. However, the truth

        diversity of things.

        4. The proposition “Nothing is its own truth” is understood of things
        having a complete act of existence in reality. It is likewise said that
        “Nothing is its own act of existence,” yet the act of existence of a
        thing is, in a sense, something created. In the same way, the truth of a
        thing is something created.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The truth by which the soul passes judgment on all things is the
        first truth; for, just as from the truth of the divine intellect there
        flow into the angelic intellects those intelligible species by which
        angels know all things, so does the truth of the first principles by
        which we judge everything proceed from the truth of the divine intellect
        as from its exemplary cause. Since we can judge by means of the truth of
        these first principles only in so far as this truth is a likeness of the
        first truth, we are said to judge everything according to the first
        truth.

        however, does not depend on a creature in so far as it is deficient, but
        in so far as it rises above its deficiency by being conformed to the
        first truth.

        1. Properly speaking, when two things are similar, likeness is found in
        both. Truth, however, being a certain agreement of intellect and thing,
        is not, properly speaking, found in both, but only in intellect; and
        since all things are true and said to be true in so far as they are in
        conformity with one intellect, the divine intellect, everything must be
        true according to one truth, even though in many Eke things there are
        many different likenesses.

        2. Although intelligible light has the divine light for its exemplary

        intelligible lights. Truth, however, is not predicated in the proper
        sense of things having the divine intellect as their exemplary cause.
        Consequently, we do not say that there is one light in the same way that
        we say that there is one truth.

        the term by a single truth—not by many truths. For that which is
        received in different ways in the things modeled upon the exemplar is
        not properly called truth with the same propriety as truth is said to be
        in the exemplar itself.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        z7. Although things differing specifically are not on their own part
        conformed with the divine intellect by one conformity, the divine
        intellect to which all things are conformed is one, and on its part
        there is one conformity with all things—even though all things are not
        conformed to it in the same way. The truth of all things, therefore, is
        one in the manner described.

        8. Augustine is speaking of truth in our mind as it is modeled upon the
        divine mind as the likeness of a face is reflected in a mirror; and, as
        we said, there are many reflections of the first truth in our souls. Or
        one can say that the first truth belongs to the genus of the soul if
        <i>genus</i> be taken in a broad sense, namely, in so far as everything
        intelligible or incorporeal is said to belong to one genus.
        <i>Genus</i> is used in this way in the Acts of the Apostles (17:2 8)
        where we read: “For we are also his offspring [ <i>genus</i> ].”

        It seems that there is some such truth, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. When treating the truth of propositions, Anselm says: “Whether truth
        be said to have, or whether it is understood not to have, a beginning or
        end, it cannot be circumscribed by a beginning or end.”’ But every truth
        is understood either to have or not to have a beginning or end.
        Therefore, no truth is circumscribed by a beginning or end, and, since
        anything like this is eternal, every truth is eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Anything whose existence is a consequence of the destruction of its
        existence is eternal; for, whether it is taken as existing or not
        existing, it follows that it is. Moreover, at any given time each and
        every thing must be held as either existing or not existing. Now, a
        consequence of the destruction of truth is that truth is; for, if truth
        is not, the fact that truth is not is true, and nothing can be true
        except by truth. Therefore, truth is eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. If the truth of propositions is not eternal, then a time must be
        assigned when their truth was not. But at that time it was true to say:
        “There is no truth of propositions.” Therefore, truth of propositions
        exists—which contradicts the supposition. Therefore, one cannot say that
        the truth of propositions is not eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The Philosopher’s proof that matter is eternal (which is false) rests
        on the fact that matter remains after its corruption and exists prior to
        its generation, since, if it corrupts, it corrupts into something, and
        if it is generated, it is generated out of something. But that from
        which something is generated and that into which it corrupts is matter.
        The same would be true of truth if it were said to undergo corruption or
        generation: it would exist before its generation and after its
        corruption. If it were generated, it would be changed from non-being to
        being, and if it corrupted, it would change from being to non-being.
        However, when truth did not exist, it would have been true that it did
        not exist—which could not be unless there was truth. Therefore, truth is
        eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Whatever cannot be conceived as not existing is eternal, for whatever
        is able not to exist can be conceived as not existing. The truth of
        propositions, however, cannot be conceived as not existing, because the
        intellect cannot understand anything unless it understands it to be
        true. Therefore, the truth of propositions is eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Anselm argues as follows: “Let him who is able think of when this
        truth began or when it did not exist.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. That which is future always was future, and that which is past will
        always be past. Consequently, a proposition about the future is true
        since something is future, and a proposition about the past is true
        since something is past. Therefore, the truth of a future proposition
        always was, as the truth of a proposition concerning the past always
        will be. Hence, not only the first truth is eternal, but also many other
        truths are eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. St. Augustine says that nothing is more eternal than the nature of a
        circle and that two and three are five. Since these are created truths,
        some truth besides the first truth is eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. For a proposition to be true, it is not necessary that something be
        actually stated. It is sufficient that something exist about which a
        proposition can be formed. But, even before the world existed, there was
        something, even apart from God, about which a proposition could be
        formed. Hence, before the world existed, the truth of propositions
        existed, and, since what existed before the world is eternal, the truth
        of propositions is eternal. The minor is proved thus: The world is made
        from nothing, that is, after nothing. Hence, before the world was, there
        was its non-existence. But a true proposition is formed not only about
        that which is, but also about that which is not; for, just as what is,
        is truly stated to be, so that which is not is truly stated not to be—as
        is clearly shown in <i>Interpretation.</i> Hence, before the world
        existed, there was that from which a true proposition could be formed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Whatever is known is true while it is known. But from all eternity
        God knew all possible propositions. Therefore, from all eternity the
        truth of all propositions has existed, and so there are many eternal
        truths.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. It was said, however, that from this it follows that those
        propositions are true in the divine intellect—not in themselves.—On the
        contrary, things must be true in the way in which they are known. But
        from eternity all things are known by God not only in so far as they are
        in His mind, but also as they exist in their proper nature; for Sirach
        (23:29) says: “All things were known to the Lord God before they were
        created: so also after they were perfected, he beholdeth all things.” He
        accordingly knows things in no other way after they are perfected than
        He did from eternity. Therefore, from eternity there were many truths
        existing not only in the divine intellect but in themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. A thing is said to exist simply in so far as it is in that which
        gives it its formal perfection. But the character of truth finds its
        formal perfection in the intellect. Hence, if from eternity there were
        many things simply true in the divine intellect, it must be granted that
        there are many eternal truths.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. Wisdom (1:15) states: “For justice is perpetual and immortal.” As
        Cicero says, however, truth is a part of justice. Hence, truth is
        perpetual and immortal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. Universals are perpetual and immortal. But the true is most

        perpetual and immortal.

        15. It was said, however, that, although a universal does not cease of
        itself, it may cease accidentally.—On the contrary, a thing ought to be
        denominated by that which belongs to it essentially rather than by that
        which belongs to it accidentally. Therefore, if truth taken essentially
        is perpetual and incorruptible, and does not cease or begin to be except
        accidentally, truth taken universally must be eternal.

        16. Since from eternity God was prior to the world, this relation of
        priority in God was eternal. But when one member of a relation is
        posited, the other must also be posited. Therefore, from eternity the
        posteriority of the world with respect to God existed; consequently,
        there was from all eternity something outside of God to which truth
        belonged in some way. Hence, our original position stands.

        17. It must be said that that relation of before and after is not
        something in nature but merely a rational relation.—On the contrary, as
        Boethius says, God is by nature prior to the world, even if the world
        had always existed. Therefore, that relation of priority is a relation
        of nature and not of reason alone.

        19. From eternity it was true that the Father generates the Son, and
        that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both. Since these are a number of
        truths, a number of truths exist from eternity.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        20. It was said, however, that these are true by one truth; hence, it
        does not follow that several truths existed from eternity.—On the
        contrary, that by which the Father is Father and generates the Son is
        not that by which the Son is Son and breathes the Holy Spirit. But by
        that by which the Father is Father it is true that the Father generates
        the Son, or that the Father is the Father; and by that by which the Son
        is the Son it is true that the Son is generated by the Father. Hence,
        propositions of this kind are not true by one truth.

        interchangeable, the same truth is not found in each of the two
        following propositions: “Man is man” and “Man is capable of laughter”;
        for the property which the word <i>man</i> predicates is not the same as
        that predicated by <i>capable</i> of <i>laughter.</i> Similarly, the
        property implied in the word <i>Father</i> is not that implied in the
        word <i>Son</i>. Therefore, the truth is not the same in the

        proposition, there can be a proposition. But from eternity the divine
        intellect existed, understanding the Father to be the Father, and the
        Son to be the Son, and thus forming propositions or speaking—since,
        according to Anselm, “for the most high Spirit to speak is the same as
        to understand.” Therefore, the propositions previously mentioned existed

        As mentioned previously, truth means a proportion and commensuration.
        Hence, something is said to be true just as something is said to be
        commensurate. A body, however, is measured both by an intrinsic measure,
        such as a line, surface, or depth, and by an extrinsic measure, such as
        happens when a located body is measured by place, or when motion is
        measured by time, or a piece of cloth by an elbow length. Similarly, a
        thing can receive the name true in two ways: by its inherent truth or by
        an extrinsic truth. In this latter way, all things receive the name true
        from the first truth; and since truth in the intellect is measured by
        things themselves, it follows that not only the truth of things, but
        also the truth of the intellect or of a proposition signifying what is
        understood, gets its name from the first truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In this commensuration or conformity of intellect and thing it is not
        necessary that each of the two actually exist. Our intellect can be in
        conformity with things that, although not existing now, will exist in
        the future. Otherwise, it would not be true to say that “the Anti-Christ
        will be born.” Hence, a proposition is said to be true because of the
        truth that is in the intellect alone even when the thing stated does not
        exist. Similarly, the divine intellect can be in conformity with things
        that did not exist eternally but were created in time; thus, those in
        time can be said to be true from eternity because of the eternal truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If we take truth, therefore, as meaning the inherent truth of true
        created things—the truth we find in things and in a created
        intellect—then truth is not eternal whether it be that of things or that
        of propositions; for neither the things themselves nor the intellect in
        which these truths inhere exists from all eternity. On the other hand,
        if we take it to mean the truth of true created things, by which all are
        said to be true—their extrinsic measure, as it were, which is the first
        truth then the truth of everything—of things, propositions, and
        intellects—is eternal. Both Augustine and Anselm search for an eternal
        truth of this sort; the latter writes: “You can understand how I have
        proved in my <i>Monologion</i> that the highest truth does not have a
        beginning or end from the truth that is in speech.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This first truth must be one for all things. For in our intellect truth
        is multiplied in only two ways: first, by the multiplicity of the things
        known, for this results in a multiplicity of conceptions upon which
        there follows a multiplicity of truths in our soul; second, by the
        multiplicity of our ways of knowing, for even though Socrates’ running
        is one thing, the soul understands time along with it by joining and
        separating—as it is said in <i>The Soul</i>. Consequently, the soul
        knows his running as present, as past, and as future—each in a different
        way. Accordingly, it forms separate conceptions in which separate truths
        are found. In divine knowledge, however, neither of these two kinds of
        diversity can be found. For God does not have separate acts of knowing
        for separate things, but by one act He knows all, since He knows all by
        a single principle, that is, by His essence, as Dionysius points out,
        and He does not direct His act of knowing toward things one by one.
        Similarly, too, His own act of knowing does not involve time, since it
        is measured by eternity, which abstracts from all time inasmuch as it
        embraces all. It remains, therefore, that there are not many truths from
        eternity, but one alone.

        1. As Anselm explains his meaning in another place, he said that the
        truth of statements is not circumscribed by a beginning or end, “not
        because the statement itself has no beginning but because no time can be
        conceived at which the statement could exist. and truth be absent from
        it.” The statement referred to here is one discussed previously, namely,
        one by which it is truly signified that something will take place in the
        future. Hence, it is quite clear that Anselm did not want to imply that
        either the truth inherent in a created thing or a proposition itself is
        without a beginning and end. Be held simply that the first truth by
        which a proposition is said to be true by a sort of extrinsic measure is
        without beginning or end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Outside the mind we find two things: the thing itself, and its
        privations and negations. These two are not related to truth in the same
        way, for they do not have the same relation to intellect. Because of the
        species it possesses, the thing itself is proportioned to the divine
        intellect as a product of art is to art. Because of the same species,
        moreover, the thing is able to conform our intellect to it, in so far as
        its likeness, being received into the soul, causes the thing itself to
        be known. But non-being, considered outside the soul, has nothing by
        which it can be proportioned to the divine intellect or cause itself to
        be known in our intellects. Hence, if non-being is in conformity with
        any intellect, it is not because of itself but because of the intellect
        which forms within itself the notion of non-being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Anything existing positively outside the soul has something in itself by
        which it can be called true; but this is not the case with the
        nonexistence of a thing: whatever truth is attributed to it comes from
        the intellect. When it is said, therefore, “It is true that truth does
        not exist,” the truth here signified has no reality except in the
        intellect, since it is about a non-being. Hence, from the fact that the
        truth in a thing is destroyed nothing follows except that there is a
        truth which is in the intellect. And so it is clear that from this
        argument we can conclude only that the truth which is in the intellect
        is eternal. This truth must, of course, be in an eternal intellect, and
        it is the first truth. Consequently, from the argument given only the
        first truth is shown to be eternal.

        5. Truth, taken without any qualification, cannot be understood as not
        existing; but all created truth can be conceived as not existing, just
        as it can be conceived that no creature exists. For the intellect can
        conceive itself as not existing and not understanding, even though it
        can never conceive without existing or understanding. It is not
        necessary, however, that, in its act of understanding, the intellect
        understand everything that it has in its act of understanding, because
        it does not always reflect upon itself. Hence, there is no contradiction
        if it understands created truth as not existing, even though, without
        it, it cannot understand.

        7. Since the future as such is not, and the past as such is not, the
        same reasoning holds for the truth of the past and future as for the
        truth of non-being. From this, as has been said, the eternity of no
        truth other than the first can be concluded.

        8. The words of Augustine must be understood in the sense that the
        truths mentioned are eternal in so far as they are in the divine mind.
        Or Augustine takes <i>eternal</i> in the sense of <i>perpetual.</i>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Although a true proposition can be made about being and nonbeing,
        being and non-being are not similarly related to truth, as is clear from
        what was said above. From it, also, the solution to this difficulty is
        clear.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Although God knew many propositions from eternity, He knew them by
        one act of knowing. Hence, from eternity there was only one truth by
        which the divine cognition was true of many things that would come about
        in time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. As is clear from our previous discussion, intellect is in conformity
        not only with things actually existing but also with those not actually
        existing—especially the divine intellect to which the past and the
        future are the same. Hence, although things did not exist from eternity
        in their own proper nature, the divine intellect was conformed with
        things in their proper nature even though they would come into being in
        time. In this way, from eternity, God had true knowledge of things, even
        in their proper natures, although the truths of things did not exist
        from eternity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Truth finds its formal perfection in the intellect, but a thing does
        not. Hence, although we must concede without qualification that the
        truth of all things was from eternity, since it was in the divine
        intellect, we cannot concede without qualification that there were true
        things from eternity merely because they existed in the divine
        intellect.

        13. The definition refers to divine justice; or, if it refers to human
        justice, then it is said to be perpetual in the way in which natural
        things are said to be perpetual. For example, we say that fire always
        moves upwards, unless impeded, because of its natural inclination. Now,
        because a virtue is, as Cicero says, “a habit resembling a nature and in
        harmony with reason,” in so far as the nature of the virtue goes, it has
        an unfailing inclination to its act, even though this is sometimes
        impeded. Hence, in the Digest one reads that justice is: “the constant
        and perpetual will to give each one his due.” However, the truth which
        is a part of justice is found in the testimony of legal trials. But we
        are not now discussing that kind of truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. The statement that a universal is perpetual and incorruptible is
        explained by Avicenna in two ways. First, a universal is said to be
        incorruptible and perpetual because, according to those who hold the
        eternity of the world, particulars had no beginning and will have no
        end. For, according to the philosophers, generation is for the purpose
        of conserving the perpetual existence of the species—since it cannot be
        preserved by the individual. Second, a universal is said to be perpetual
        in so far as it does not cease of itself but accidentally—because of the
        corruption of the individual.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. A thing is predicated of another essentially in two ways. First, it
        is done positively, as when we say of fire that it is carried upwards. A
        thing gets its name from this kind of essential predicate rather than
        from an accidental predicate; for we say rather that fire is carried
        upwards and belongs to the class of things carried upwards than that it
        belongs to the class of those that are carried downwards, even though it
        may happen, accidentally, that fire is carried downwards—as would
        evidently be the case of red-hot iron.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The second type of essential predication is by “removal”—when there is
        removed from a thing those things which bring on a contrary disposition.
        If one of those things should happen to be present, the contrary
        disposition will be predicated absolutely. For example, unity is
        predicated essentially of first matter, not by positing some unifying
        form, but by removing diversifying forms. Hence, when forms occur which
        differentiate matter, we say, without qualification, that there are
        several matters rather than that there is only one. Such is the case in
        the difficulty; for a universal is said to be incorruptible, not because
        it possesses some form giving it incorruptibility, but because those
        material qualities which cause corruption in individuals do not belong
        to it as a universal. Hence, a universal existing in particular things
        is said, without qualification, to be corrupted in this or that
        individual.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. All genera as such, with the exception of relation, posit something
        in reality. For example, quantity by its very nature posits something.
        But relation, alone, because of what it is, does not posit anything in
        reality, for what it predicates is not <i>something</i> but
        <i>to something.</i> Hence, there are certain relations which posit
        nothing in reality, but only in reason. This occurs in four ways, as can
        be seen in the writings of the Philosopher and Avicenna.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        First, there occurs a relation merely in reason when a thing is referred
        to itself; for example, when we say that a thing is identical with
        itself. If this relation posited something in reality in addition to the
        thing which is declared to be identical with itself, we should have an
        infinite process in relations; for the very relation by which something
        is said to be identical with itself would also be identical with itself
        through an added relation, and so on to infinity. Second, a relation
        existing only in reason occurs when the relation itself is referred to
        something. For example, one cannot say that paternity is referred to its
        subject by some intermediate relation; for that mediate relation would
        need another intermediate relation, and so on to infinity. Consequently,
        the relation signified when paternity is compared to its subject is not
        real but only rational. Third, a relation existing in reason alone
        occurs when one of the related things depends on the other and not
        conversely. For example, knowledge depends on the thing known but not
        the other way about. Hence, the relation of knowledge to a thing known
        is something real, but the relation of the thing known to knowledge is
        merely rational. Fourth, a rational relation occurs when a being is
        compared with a non-being. For example, we say that we are prior to
        those who are to come after us. If this were a real relation, it would
        follow (if future generations were infinite) that there could be an
        infinite number of relations in the same thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From the last two types it is clear that that relation of priority
        posits nothing in reality but only in the intellect, because God does
        not depend on creatures and because such a priority is a relation of
        being to non-being. From this argument, therefore, it does not follow
        that there is an eternal truth except in the divine intellect, which
        alone is eternal. This is the first truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        17. Although God is prior by nature to created beings, it does not
        follow that this relation is real. Since it arises merely from a
        consideration of what is naturally prior and what is naturally
        posterior—in the way in which a thing known is said to be naturally
        prior to knowledge—the relation of the thing known to knowledge is not a
        real relation. The statement that, even when signification does not
        exist, it is nevertheless correct that something is signified, is taken
        with respect to the order of things existing in the divine intellect.
        For example, even when a trunk does not exist, it is correct to say that
        a trunk has a lid according to the plan conceived by the craftsman.
        Consequently, this argument also does not prove that there is an eternal
        truth other than the first.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        18. The intelligible character of the true is based upon being. Although
        several persons and properties are posited in God, only one act of being
        is posited in Him, for the act of being is predicated essentially of
        Him; so, all those propositions, such as that the Father is or
        generates, and that the Son is or is generated, and so on,—in so far as
        they are related to the divine essence—all have one truth, the first and
        eternal truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        20. Although that by which the Father is Father, and that by which the
        Son is Son, are different, since one is paternity, the other, filiation,
        that by which the Father is, and that by which the Son is, is the same.
        For each is because of the divine essence, which is one. Moreover, the
        intelligible character of truth is not based upon the character of
        paternity and sonship as such, but upon the character of being. Here,
        moreover, paternity and sonship are the one essence. Therefore, there is
        one truth for both.

        21. The property predicated by <i>man</i> and

        one act of existence, as is the case of paternity and sonship. Hence,
        there is no analogy.

        22. The divine intellect knows things, no matter how diverse they be, by
        one act of knowing, even if they have different truths considered in
        themselves. Hence, He knows with only one act of knowing all the various
        propositions about the persons even to a greater degree. Consequently,
        there is only one truth for these, also.

        1. Anselm says: “By this argument, I see that truth persists
        immutable.”’ The argument he refers to is that taken from the truth of
        Signification, which we discussed earlier. Hence, the truth of
        propositions is immutable; for the same reason, so is the truth of the
        thing which it signifies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. If the truth of a proposition changes; it changes especially when a
        thing changes. But when a thing has been changed, the truth of the
        proposition remains. Therefore, the truth of a proposition is immutable.
        Proof of the minor: Truth according to Anselm is “a certain
        correctness—inasmuch as the thing fulfills that which it receives in the
        divine mind. But the fact that the proposition, “Socrates is sitting,”
        signifies the sitting of Socrates comes from the divine mind, and this
        proposition will signify his sitting even when Socrates does not sit.
        Therefore, even when Socrates does not sit, truth remains in that
        proposition. Consequently, the truth of the proposition is not changed,
        even if the thing be changed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. If truth is changed, this can be only because the subjects in which
        truth inheres have previously been changed—just as certain forms cannot
        be said to be changed unless their subjects have changed. But truth is
        not changed with the change of true things; for, as both Augustine and
        Anselm prove, when true things have been destroyed, truth still remains.
        Therefore, truth is entirely immutable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The truth of a thing is the cause of the truth of a proposition, for
        a statement is said to be true or false in so far as a thing exists or
        does not exist. But the truth of a thing is immutable. Therefore, the
        truth of a proposition is also immutable. Proof of the minor: Anselm
        proves that the truth of a proposition remains fixed to the extent that
        it fulfills that which it has received in the divine mind. But each
        thing likewise fulfills that which it has been ordained in the divine
        mind to have. Therefore, the truth of each and every thing is immutable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. That which always remains when every change has been made is never
        changed. For example, when colors are changed, we do not say that the
        surface is changed, for it remains no matter what change of colors is
        made. Now, truth remains in a thing, no matter what change a thing
        undergoes, for being and the true are interchangeable. Therefore, truth
        is immutable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Where there is the same cause, there is the same effect. But the same
        thing is the cause of the truth of these three propositions: “Socrates
        sits,” “Socrates will sit,” and “Socrates sat”—namely, the sitting of
        Socrates. Therefore, the truth of each is the same. Now, if one of these
        three propositions is true, one of the other two must always be true;
        for, if at some time it is true that Socrates sits, it always was true
        and will be true that Socrates sat or will sit. Therefore, one truth
        remains constant for the three propositions, and, consequently, is
        immutable. For the same reason, any other truth is immutable.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Effects are changed when their causes are changed. But things, which
        cause the truth of a proposition, undergo changes. Therefore, the truth
        of propositions changes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A thing is said to be changed in two ways. First, because it is the
        subject of a change, as when we say that a body is changeable. In this
        meaning, no form is said to be changeable. Consequently, a form is said
        to be something steadfast in an unchanging essence; since truth consists
        in a form, the present question is not whether truth is mutable in this
        sense. Second, a thing is said to be changed because something else
        changes according to it, as when we say that whiteness is changed
        because a body is changed in its whiteness. It is in this sense that we
        ask whether or not truth is changeable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To clarify this point, we should note that the thing according to which
        there is a change is sometimes said to be changed and sometimes not.
        For, when it is inhering in a thing which is affected in its respect,
        then it is said to be changed itself—as whiteness or quantity is said to
        be changed when something is changed in their respect because they
        succeed each other in a subject. When, however, that according to which
        the change occurs is extrinsic, the thing itself is not changed but
        remains unaffected throughout the whole change. For example, a place is
        not said to be moved when a thing moves with respect to it. For this
        reason, it is said in the Physics that place is “the unchangeable
        boundary of the container,” because local motion does not mean a
        succession of loci in regard to one located body, but a succession of
        many located bodies in one place.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, there are two ways in which inhering forms are said to be changed
        with respect to a change of their subject; for general forms are said to
        be changed in one way and special forms in another. After a change, a
        special form does not remain the same either according to its act of
        existing or according to its intelligible character. For example, when a
        qualitative change has been made, whiteness does not remain at all. But,
        after a change has been made, a general form retains the same
        intelligible character, though not the same act of existing. For
        example, after a change from white to black has taken place, color,
        according to the general character of color, remains unchanged; but the
        same species of color does not remain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It was noted previously,” however, that a thing is said to be true by
        the first truth as by an extrinsic measure; but it is said to be true by
        an inherent truth as by an intrinsic measure. Consequently, created
        things change in their participation of the first truth, yet the first
        truth itself, according to which they are said to be true, does not
        change in any way. This is what Augustine says: “Our minds sometimes see
        more, sometimes less, of truth itself; but truth itself remains, and
        neither increases nor decreases.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If we take truth as inherent in things, however, then truth is said to
        be changed inasmuch as some things are said to be changed with respect
        to truth. For, as pointed out previously, truth in creatures is found in
        two different subjects: in things themselves and in intellect. The truth
        of an action is included in the truth of a thing, and the truth of a
        proposition is included in the truth of the understanding which it
        signifies. A thing, however, is said to be true by its relation to
        intellect, divine and human.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consequently, if the truth of a thing is considered according to its
        reference to the divine intellect, then, indeed, the truth of a
        changeable thing is changed into another truth, but not into falsity.
        For truth is a most general form because the true and being are
        interchangeable. Hence, just as, even after any change has been made, a
        thing nevertheless remains a being, although it is other as a result of
        the other form by which it has existence; so, also, a thing always
        remains true—but by another truth; for, no matter what form or what
        privation it acquires through the change, it is conformed in that
        respect to the divine intellect, which knows it as it is, whatever may
        be its state.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If, however, the truth of a thing is considered in its reference to a
        human intellect, or conversely, then sometimes there is a change from
        truth into falsity, sometimes from one truth to another. For truth is
        “an equation of thing and intellect”; and, if equal amounts are taken
        from things that are equal, these things remain equal, although the
        equality is not the same. Hence, when intellect and thing are similarly
        changed, truth remains; but it is another truth. For example, when
        Socrates sits, what is understood is that Socrates is sitting.
        Afterwards, when he does not sit, what is understood is that he is not
        sitting. But, if something is taken from one of two equal things, and
        nothing from the other, or if unequal amounts are taken from each, then
        inequality must result; and this corresponds to falsity, just as
        equality corresponds to truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consequently, if an intellect is true, and it is not changed when a
        thing is changed, or vice versa, or if each is changed but not
        similarly, falsity results, and there will be a change from truth to
        falsity. For example, if, when Socrates is white, he is understood to be
        white, the intellect is true. If, however, the intellect later
        understands him to be black, although Socrates still is white; or if,
        conversely, he is still understood to be white, although he has turned
        black; or if, when he has turned pale, he is understood to be
        reddish—then there will be falsity in the intellect. Accordingly, it is
        clear how truth changes and how it does not.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Anselm is speaking here of the first truth according to which all
        things are said to be true as by an extrinsic measure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2.Since the intellect reflects upon itself and knows itself as it knows
        other things (as said in <i>The Soul</i>), the things belonging to the
        intellect as regards the intelligible character of truth can be
        considered in two ways. First, in so far as they are things; in this
        way, truth is predicated of them in the same way in which it is
        predicated of other things. Consequently, as a thing is said to be true
        because it fulfills what was assigned to it in the divine mind by
        retaining its own nature, so a proposition is also said to be true by
        retaining its own nature, which was also allotted to it in the divine
        mind; and this cannot be taken from it as long as the proposition itself
        remains. Second, these may be considered in their reference to things
        that are known. In this way, a proposition is said to be true when it is
        proportioned to a thing. This kind of truth is changed, as has been
        said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Truth which remains after true things have been destroyed is the
        first truth, which does not change even when things change.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. As long as a thing remains, no change can take place in it concerning
        its essentials. For example, it is essential to a proposition that it
        signify that which it has been made to signify. Consequently, it does
        not follow that the truth of a thing is in no way changeable, but only
        that it is unchangeable with respect to the essentials of the thing
        while the thing remains. Nevertheless, in those cases in which a change
        occurs through corruption of a thing, but only with respect to its
        accidentals, this accidental change can take place even though the thing
        remains. In this way, a change can take place in the truth of a thing in
        regard to its accidentals.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. When every change has been made, truth remains, but not the same
        truth—as is clear from what has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The identity of the truth depends not only on the identity of the
        thing but also on the identity of the intellect—the same way that
        identity of an effect depends on the identity of the agent and that of
        the patient. Moreover, even though the same thing is signified by those
        three propositions, the understanding of each is not the same; for time
        enters into the intellect’s conjunctive operation, and the
        understandings of things differ with the differences of time.

        1. In regard to God, whatever implies the relation of origin is
        predicated personally. But truth belongs to this class, as is clear from
        Augustine;’ for he says that the divine truth is “the greatest possible
        likeness of its source, without any unlikeness” from which falseness
        arises. Therefore, truth is predicated personally of God.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In regard to God, truth can be taken in two ways: properly and, as it
        were, metaphorically. If truth is taken properly, then it will imply an
        equality of the divine intellect and of a thing. Since the first thing
        the divine intellect knows is its own essence, through which it knows
        all other things, truth in God principally implies an equality between
        the divine intellect and a thing which is its essence; and, in a
        secondary sense, truth likewise implies an equality of the divine
        intellect with created things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The divine intellect and the divine essence are not, however, made equal
        to each other in the way in which a measure is related to what is
        measured, since one is not the source of the other, but both are
        entirely identical. Consequently, the truth resulting from such equality
        does not involve its having the character of a source, whether it be
        considered from the standpoint of the essence or from that of the
        intellect, since both in this case are one and the same. For, just as in
        God the knower and the thing known are the same, so also in Him the
        truth of the thing and that of intellect are the same, without any
        connotation of origin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But if the truth of the divine intellect be considered in its conformity
        to created things, the same truth will still remain; for God knows
        Himself and other things through the same means. However, there is added
        to the concept of truth the note of origin with respect to creatures, to
        which the divine intellect is compared as a measure and cause. Moreover,
        in theological matters every name which does not imply the notion of
        origin or of being from a principle is predicated essentially. And even
        if the name implies the notion of origin of creatures, it still is also
        predicated essentially. Consequently, if truth is taken properly in
        whatever pertains to God, it is predicated essentially; yet it is
        appropriated to the person of the Son, as are also art and all else
        pertaining to intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Truth is taken metaphorically or figuratively in divine matters when we
        take it according to that formal character by which truth is found in
        created things. For in these, truth is said to exist inasmuch as a
        created thing imitates its source, the divine intellect. Similarly, when
        truth is applied to God and is said to be the highest possible imitation
        of its principle, this is attributed to the Son. Taken in this way,
        truth properly belongs to the Son and is predicated personally; and
        this, too, is what Augustine says.

        2. When equality is referred to divine things it sometimes implies a
        relation that indicates a distinction of Persons—as when we say that the
        Father and the Son are equal. In this respect a real distinction is
        understood in the word <i>equality.</i> Sometimes, however, a real
        distinction is not understood in the word <i>equality,</i> but merely a
        rational distinction, as when we say that the divine wisdom and the
        divine goodness are equal. Hence, equality does not necessarily imply a
        distinction of persons. Such also is the distinction implied in the word
        <i>truth,</i> since truth is an equality of intellect and essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although truth is conceived by the intellect, the notion of a concept

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Fornication is a true thing; yet it is not from the first truth.
        Therefore, not every truth is from the first truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The answer was given that fornication is said to be true by reason of
        the truth of the sign or concept, and this is from God. Its truth as a
        thing, however, is not from God.—On the contrary, besides the first
        truth, there is not only the truth of the sign or of the concept, but
        also the truth of the thing. Therefore, if its truth as a thing is not
        from God, then there is a truth of a thing not from God, and our
        proposition that not every truth other than the first is from God will
        have to be granted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. From “He fornicates,” it follows that “fornication is true.”
        Therefore, a transition can be made from the truth of a proposition to
        the truth of what is said, which in turn expresses the truth of the
        thing. Consequently, the truth mentioned consists in this: that that act
        is joined to that subject. But the truth of what is said would not arise
        from the conjunction of such an act with a subject unless the
        conjunction of the act, which has the deformity, were understood.
        Therefore, the truth of the thing regards not only the very essence of
        an act but also its deformity. But an act considered as having a
        deformity is by no means from God. Not all truth of things, therefore,
        is from God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Anselm says that a thing is called true if it is as it ought to be.
        Among the ways in which a thing can be said to be what it ought to be he
        mentions one, namely, that it happens with God’s permission. Now, God’s
        permission extends even to the deformity in an act. Therefore, the truth
        of the thing reaches as far as that deformity. But dcformity is in no
        way from God. Therefore, not every truth is from God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. It was said, however, that just as a deformity or privation cannot be
        called a being without qualification, but only a being in a certain
        respect, so also a deformity or privation cannot be said to have truth
        without qualification, but only in a certain respect. Such a restricted
        truth is not from God.—On the contrary, to being, the true adds a
        reference to intellect. Now, although privation or deformity in itself
        is not being absolutely, it is apprehended absolutely by the intellect.
        Therefore, even though it does not have entity absolutely, it does have
        truth absolutely.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Everything qualified is reduced to something unqualified. For
        example, “An Ethiopian is white with respect to teeth” is reduced to
        this: “The teeth of an Ethiopian are white without qualification.”
        Consequently, if some limited truth is not from God, then not every
        qualified truth will be from God—which is absurd.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. What is not the cause of the cause is not the cause of the effect.
        For example, God is not the cause of the deformity of sin, for He is not
        the cause of the defect in a free choice from which the deformity of sin
        arises. Now, just as the act of existing is the cause of the truth of
        affirmative propositions, so non-existing is the cause of negative
        propositions. Now, as Augustine says, since God is not the cause of this
        non-existing, it follows that He is not the cause of negative
        propositions. Hence, not every truth is from God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Augustine says: “The true is that which is as it appears.”3 Now, an
        evil thing is as it appears. Therefore, something evil is true. But no
        evil is from God. Therefore, not every true thing is from God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. But it was said that evil is not seen through the species of evil but
        through the species of a good.—On the contrary, the species of a good
        never makes anything appear but that good. Consequently, if evil is seen
        only through the species of a good, evil will appear only as a good. But
        this is false.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Commenting on the text, “And no man can say the Lord Jesus...” (1
        Cor. 12:3), Ambrose says: “Every true thing, no matter who says it, is
        from the Holy Spirit.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. All created goodness is from the first uncreated goodness, God. For
        the same reason, all other truth is from the first truth, God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The formal character of truth finds its completion in the intellect.
        But every intellect is from God. Hence, every truth is from God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Augustine says: “The true is that which is.” But every act of
        existing is from God. Therefore, every truth is from Him.

        5. just as the one is interchangeable with being, so is the true, and
        conversely. But all unity is from the first unity, as Augustine says.
        Therefore, every truth also is from the first truth.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As is clear from what has been said among created things truth is found
        both in things and in intellect. In the intellect it is found according
        to the conformity which the intellect has with the things whose notions
        it has. In things it is found according as they imitate the divine
        intellect, which is their measure—as art is the measure of all products
        of art—and also in another way, according as they can by their very
        nature bring about a true apprehension of themselves in the human
        intellect, which, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, is measured by
        things. By its form a thing existing outside the soul imitates the art
        of the divine intellect; and, by the same form, it is such that it can
        bring about a true apprehension in the human intellect. Through this
        form, moreover, each and every thing has its act of existing.
        Consequently, the truth of existing things includes their entity in its
        intelligible character, adding to this a relation of conformity to the
        human or divine intellect. But negations or privations existing outside
        the soul do not have any form by which they can imitate the model of
        divine art or introduce a knowledge of themselves into the human
        intellect. The fact that they are conformed to intellect is due to the
        intellect, which apprehends their intelligible notes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is clear, therefore, that when a stone and blindness are said to be
        true, truth is not related to both in the same way; for truth predicated
        of the stone includes in its notion the entity of the stone, adding a
        reference to intellect, which is also caused by the thing itself since
        it has something by which it can be referred to intellect. As predicated
        of blindness, however, truth does not include in itself that privation
        which is blindness, but only the relation of blindness to intellect.
        This relation, moreover, is not supported by anything in the blindness
        itself, since blindness is not conformed to intellect by virtue of
        anything which it has in itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, it is clear that the truth found in created things can include
        nothing more than the entity of a thing and conformity of the thing to
        intellect or conformity of intellect to things or to the privations of
        things. All this is entirely from God, because both the very form of a
        thing, through which it is conformed, is from God, and the truth itself
        in so far as it is the good of the intellect, as is said in the
        <i>Ethics</i>; for the good of any thing whatsoever consists in its
        perfect operation. But since the perfect operation of the intellect
        consists in its knowing the true, that is its good in the sense just
        mentioned. Hence, since every good and every form is from God, one must
        say, without any qualification, that every truth is from God.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The argument—“Every true thing is from God. But to fornicate is true.
        Therefore.”—falls into the fallacy of accident. For, as is evident from
        our discussion above,* when we say that fornicating is true, we do not
        imply that the defect involved in the act of fornication is included in
        the notion of truth. True predicates merely the conformity of that act
        to an intellect. Hence, one cannot conclude that fornicating is from
        God, but merely that its truth is from God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. As is clear from our reply just above, deformities and other defects
        do not possess truth in the same say that other things do. Consequently,
        even though the truth of defects is from God, it does not follow that
        the deformity is from God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. According to the Philosopher, truth does not consist in the
        composition found in things but in that made by the soul. Hence, truth
        does not consist in this, that the act with its deformity inheres in a
        subject (for this is proper, rather, to the character of good and evil).
        It consists in the conformity of the act, inherent in its subject, to
        the soul’s apprehension.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The good, the due, the right, and all other things of this sort are
        related in one way to the divine permission, and in another, to other
        manifestations of the divine will. In the latter, there is a reference
        to the object of the will act, as well as to the will act itself. For
        example, when God commands that parents be honored, both the honor to be
        given parents and the act of commanding are goods. But in a divine
        permission there is a reference only to the subjective act of
        permitting, and not to the object of the permission. Hence, it is right
        that God should permit deformities, but it does not follow from this
        that the deformity itself has some rectitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. [The solution to the fifth difficulty is not given.]
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The qualified truth which belongs to negations and defects is
        reducible to that unqualified truth which is in the intellect and from
        God. Consequently, the truth of defects is from God, although the
        defects themselves are not from Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Non-existing is not the cause of the truth of negative propositions
        in the sense that it causes them to exist in the intellect. The soul
        itself does this by conforming itself to a non-being outside the soul.
        Hence, this non-existing outside the soul is not the efficient cause of
        truth in the soul, but, as it were, its exemplary cause. The difficulty
        is based upon the efficient cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Although evil is not from God, that evil is seen to be what it is, is
        from God. Hence, the truth by which it is true that there is evil is
        from God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Although evil does not act on the soul except through the species of
        good, nevertheless, since evil is a deficient good, the soul grasps t e
        intelligible character of the defect, and so conceives the character of
        evil. Accordingly, evil is seen as evil.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Truth is both in intellect and in sense, but not in the same way. It is
        in intellect as a consequence of the act of the intellect and as known
        by the intellect. Truth follows the operation of the intellect inasmuch
        as it belongs to the intellect to judge about a thing as it is. And
        truth is known by the intellect in view of the fact that the intellect
        reflects upon its own act—not merely as knowing its own act, but as
        knowing the proportion of its act to the thing. Now, this proportion
        cannot be known without knowing the nature of the act; and the nature of
        the act cannot be known without knowing the nature of the active
        principle, that is, the intellect itself, to whose nature it belongs to
        be conformed to things. Consequently, it is because the intellect
        reflects upon itself that it knows truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Truth is in sense also as a consequence of its act, for sense judges of
        things as they are. Truth is not in sense, however, as something known
        by sense; for, although sense judges truly about things, it does not
        know the truth by which it truly judges. Although sense knows that it
        senses, it does not know its own nature; consequently, it knows neither
        the nature of its act nor the proportion of this act to things. As a
        result, it does not know its truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The reason for this is that the most perfect beings, such as, for
        example, intellectual substances, return to their essence with a
        complete return: knowing something external to themselves, in a certain
        sense they go outside of themselves; but by knowing that they know, they
        are already beginning to return to themselves, because the act of
        cognition mediates between the knower and the thing known. That return
        is completed inasmuch as they know their own essences. Hence, it is said
        in <i>The Causes</i>: “A being which is such as to know its own essence
        returns to it by a complete return.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Since sense is closer to an intellectual substance than other things
        are, it begins to return to its essence; it not only knows the sensible,
        but it also knows that it senses. Its return, however, is not complete,
        since it does not know its own essence. Avicenna” has given the reason
        for this by pointing out that the sense knows nothing except through a
        bodily organ, and a bodily organ cannot be a medium between a sensing
        power and itself. But powers without any ability to sense cannot return
        to themselves in any way, for they do not know that they are acting. For
        example, fire does not know that it is heating.

        1. According to Augustine: “The true is that which is.”’ Hence, the
        false is that which is not. Now, what is not is not a thing. Therefore,
        no thing is false.
      </p>

        2. It was said that the true is a differentia of being; consequently,
        the false, like the true, is that which is.—On the contrary, no dividing
        differentia is interchangeable with that whose differentia it is. Now,
        as was said, the true is interchangeable with being. Consequently, the
        true is not a dividing differentia of being, for this would make it
        possible to call some thing false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Truth is a conformity of thing and intellect. Now, an things are
        conformed to the divine intellect, since in itself nothing can be other
        than it is known to be by the divine intellect. Hence, all things are
        true, and nothing is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. All things possess truth from their forms. For example, one is said
        to be a true man if he has the true form of a man. But there is nothing
        which does not have some form, for every act of existing comes from
        form. Hence, everything is true, and there is no thing which is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Good and evil are related as true and false are related. Now, since
        evil is found in things, it has concrete reality only in something good,
        as Dionysius and Augustine say. Therefore, if falseness is found in
        things, it can have reality only in what is true. But this does not seem
        possible, for then the same thing would be both true and false; but this
        is impossible. This would mean, for example, that man and white are the
        same because whiteness is made real in a man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Augustine proposes the following difficulty. If a thing is called
        false, it is either because it is similar or because it is dissimilar.
        “If because it is dissimilar, there is nothing that cannot be called
        false, for there is nothing that is not unlike something else. If
        because it is similar, all things loudly protest, for they are true
        because they are similar.” Therefore, falsity cannot be found in things
        in any way.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Augustine defines the false as follows: “The false is that which
        approaches the likeness of something else without being that whose
        likeness it bears. But every creature bears the likeness of God.
        Therefore, since no creature is identical with God Himself, it seems
        that every creature is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Augustine says that “Every body is a true body and a false unity.
        Now, a body is said to be false because it imitates unity, yet is not a
        unity. Therefore, since every creature, in so far as it is perfect,
        imitates the divine perfection, and, nevertheless, in any perfection
        which it has, remains infinitely distant from it, it seems that every
        creature is false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The good, like the true, is interchangeable with being. But the
        interchangeability of the good and being does not stand in the way of a
        thing’s being evil. Therefore, the fact that the true is interchangeable
        with being does not stand in the way of a thing’s being false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Anselm says that there are two kinds of truth in propositions. “The
        first type occurs when the proposition has the meaning which was given
        to it.” For example, this proposition, “Socrates sits,” means that
        Socrates is sitting, whether he is actually sitting or not. “The second
        type of truth occurs when the proposition signifies that for which it
        was formed”—and it has been formed to signify that something is when it
        is. In this respect, a proposition is properly said to be true. In the
        same way, a thing may be called true when it fulfills its purpose, and
        false when it does not do so. But everything which falls short of its
        end does not fulfill its purpose; and, since there are many things of
        this sort, it seems that many things are false.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Just as truth consists in an equation of thing and intellect, so falsity
        consists in an inequality between them. Now, as was said, a thing is
        related to divine and human intellects. In regard to everything that is
        positively predicated of things or found in them, it is related to the
        divine in one way as the measured to its measure; for all such things
        come from the divine intellect’s art. A thing is related in another way
        to the divine intellect: as a thing known is related to the knower. In
        this way even negations and defects are equated to the divine intellect,
        since God knows all these even though He does not cause them. It is
        clear, then, that a thing is conformed to the divine intellect in
        whatever way it exists, under any for in whatsoever or even under a
        privation or a defect. Consequently, it is clear that everything is true
        in its relation to the divine intellect. Hence, Anselm says: “There is,
        then, truth in the essence of all things which are, for they are what
        they are in the highest truth.” Therefore, in its relation to the divine
        intellect, nothing can be false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In its relation to a human intellect, however, an inequality of thing
        with intellect, caused in some way by the thing, is occasionally found;
        for a thing makes itself known in the soul by its exterior appearance,
        since our cognition takes its beginning from sense, whose direct object
        is sensible qualities. For this reason it is said in <i>The Soul</i>:
        “Accidents greatly contribute to our knowledge of the quiddity.”
        Consequently, when there are manifested in any object sensible qualities
        indicating a nature which does not actually underlie them, that thing is
        said to be false. Hence, the Philosopher says that those things are
        called false “which are such as to seem to be what they are not, or of a
        kind which they are not.” For example, that is called “false” gold which
        has in its external appearance the color and other accidents of genuine
        gold, whereas the nature of gold does not interiorly underlie them. But
        a thing is not to be the cause of falsity in the soul in the sense that
        it necessarily causes falsity; for truth and falsity exist principally
        in the soul’s judgment; and the soul, inasmuch as it judges about
        things, is not acted upon by things, but rather, in a sense, acts upon
        them. Hence, a thing is not said to be false because it always of itself
        causes a false apprehension, but rather because its natural appearance
        is likely to cause a false apprehension.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As was pointed out previously,” however, the relation to the divine
        intellect is essential to a thing; and in this respect a thing is said
        to be true in itself. Its relation to the human intellect is accidental
        to it; and in this respect a thing is not true, absolutely speaking but,
        as it were, in some respect and in potency. Therefore, all things are
        true absolutely speaking, and nothing is false. But in a certain
        respect, that is, with reference to our intellect, some things are said
        to be false. Hence, it is necessary to answer the arguments of both
        sides.

        1. The definition, “The true is that which is,” does not perfectly
        express the intelligible character of truth. It expresses it, as it
        were, only materially, unless is here signifies the affirmation of a
        proposition, and means that a thing is said to be true when it is said
        to be or to be understood as it is in reality. Taken in this sense, the
        false may be said to be that which does not exist; it is not as it is
        said or understood to be. And this type of falsity can be found in
        things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Properly speaking, the true cannot be a differentia of being, for
        being does not have any differentia, as is proved in the
        <i>Metaphysics.</i> But in some sense the true, as well as the good, is
        related to being in the manner of a differentia, since it expresses
        something about being which is not expressed by the noun
        <i>being;</i> and in this sense the meaning of being is indeterminate
        with respect to the meaning of the true. Consequently, the meaning of
        the true is compared to the notion of being somewhat as a differentia is
        compared to its genus.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That argument must be conceded, since it treats a thing in its
        relation to the divine intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. All things have some form, yet not everything has that form whose
        characteristics are externally manifested by sensible qualities; and it
        is in regard to these that a thing is said to be false if it is
        naturally apt to produce a false estimation about itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. As is clear from what has been said, something outside the soul is
        said to be false if it is naturally such as to give a false impression
        of itself. But what is nothing is not capable of making any impression,
        since it does not move a knowing power. What is said to be false,
        therefore, must be a being; and since every being, in so far as it is a
        being, is true, falsity must exist in things and be based upon some
        truth. For this reason Augustine says” that a tragedian representing
        true persons in dramas would not be false without being a true
        tragedian. Sin-lilarly, a painting of a horse would not be a false horse
        were it not a true picture. It does not follow, however, that
        contradictories are true, because the affirmation and the negation in
        expressing the true and the false do not refer to the same reality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. A thing is said to be false in so far as, by its nature, it is likely
        to deceive. When I say <i>deceive,</i> however, I mean an action that
        brings on some defect; for nothing can act except to the extent that it
        is being, and every defect is non-being. Moreover, everything has some
        likeness to the true to the extent that it is a being; and in so far as
        it does not exist it departs from this likeness. Consequently, this
        <i>deceiving</i> as implying action arises from likeness; but the defect
        it implies (and in which the intelligible character of falsity formally
        consists) arises from unlikeness. Hence, Augustine says that falsity
        arises from unlikeness.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The soul is not so constituted as to be deceived by any likeness
        whatsoever, but only by a considerable resemblance which makes it
        difficult to discover the unlikeness. Hence, the soul is deceived by
        similarities, more or less great, according to the varying degrees of
        its acuteness in discovering unlikenesses. A thing, however, should not
        be said to be absolutely false because it leads into error, however much
        it may do that, but only because it is such as to deceive many or highly
        intelligent men. Now, although creatures bear some resemblance to God in
        themselves, so great is the dissimilarity between the two that only
        because of great stupidity could it happen that a mind would be deceived
        by such similarity. Hence, from the similarity and dissimilarity between
        creatures and God, it does not follow that all creatures should be
        called false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Some have thought that God is a body; and, since He is the unity by
        which all things are one, they consequently thought that body was unity
        itself, because of its likeness to unity. Therefore, a body is called a
        false unity for this reason, that it has led or could lead some into the
        error of believing it to be unity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. There are two kinds of perfection, first and second. First perfection
        is the form of each thing, and that by which it has its act of existing.
        Nothing is without it while it continues in existence. Second perfection
        is operation, which is the end of a thing or the means by which a thing
        reaches its end; and a thing is sometimes deprived of this perfection.
        The note of truth in things results from first perfection; for it is
        because a thing has a form that it imitates the art of the divine
        intellect and produces knowledge of itself in the soul. But the note of
        goodness in things results from its second perfection, for this goodness
        arises from the end. Consequently, evil, but not falsity, is found in
        things absolutely.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. According to the Philosopher,”’ the true itself is the good of the
        intellect, for an operation of intellect is perfect because its concept
        is true. And since a proposition is a sign of what is understood, truth
        is its end. But this is not the case with other things, and so there is
        no similarity.

        1. As is said in <i>The Soul</i>: “The intellect is always correct.”’
        Now, since the intellect is the superior part of man, his other parts
        must also pursue correctness—just as the disposition of lower bodies in
        the universe depends on the motion of the higher bodies. Therefore,
        sense, which is the inferior part of the soul, will also always be
        correct there is, then, no falsity in it.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Augustine says: “Our eyes do not deceive us: they can report to the
        mind only their own modification, And if all the bodily senses report as
        they are affected, I do not know what more we can require of them.”
        Hence, there is no falsity in the senses.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. According to Augustine: “A thing is called false because it is far
        from being a likeness of the true, even though it does in some way
        imitate the true.” Now, a sense has at times a likeness of certain
        things other than they are in reality. For example, when the eye is
        pressed, one thing is sometimes seen as two. Consequently, there is
        falsity in sense.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The answer was given that sense is not deceived with regard to proper
        sensibles, but only with regard to common sensibles.—On the contrary,
        whenever something is apprehended about a thing other than it is, the
        apprehension is false. Now, when a white body is seen through a green
        glass, the sense apprehends it other than it is, for it sees it as green
        and judges accordingly—unless a higher judgment is present, detecting
        the falsity. Therefore, sense is deceived even with regard to proper
        sensibles.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Our knowledge, taking its start from things, proceeds in this order.
        First, it begins in sense; second, it is completed in the intellect. As
        a consequence, sense is found to be in some way an intermediary between
        the intellect and things; for with reference to things, it is, as it
        were, an intellect, and with reference to intellect, it is, as it were,
        a thing. Hence, truth or falsity is said to be in sense in two respects.
        The first is in the relation of sense to intellect. In this respect, the
        sense is said to be true or false as a thing is, namely, in so far as it
        causes a true or false judgment in the intellect. The second respect is
        in the relation of sense to things. In this, truth and falsity are said
        to be in sense as they are said to be in the intellect, namely, in so
        far as the sense judges that what is, is or is not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, if we speak of a sense in the first meaning, in a way there is
        falsity in sense, and in a way there is not. For sense, in itself, is a
        thing; and it also passes judgment on other things. If, in its relation
        to the intellect, it is considered as a thing, then there is no falsity
        in sense; for a sense reveals its state to the intellect exactly as it
        is affected. Hence, Augustine says, in the passage referred to: “The
        senses can report to the mind only how they are affected.” On the other
        hand, if sense is considered in its relation to the intellect as
        representing some other thing, it may be called false in view of the
        fact that it sometimes represents a thing to the intellect other than it
        actually is. For, in that case, as we said about things, it is such as
        to cause a false judgment in the intellect—but not necessarily, since
        the intellect judges on what is presented by sense just as it judges
        about things. Thus, in its relation to the intellect, sense always
        produces a true judgment in the intellect with respect to its own
        condition, but not always with respect to the condition of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If sense is considered in its relation to things, however, then there
        are truth and falsity in sense in the manner in which these are in the
        intellect. For truth and falsity are found primarily and principally in
        the judgment of the intellect as it associates and dissociates, and in
        the formation of quiddities, only in their relation to the judgment
        following upon this formation. Hence, truth and falsity are properly
        said to be in sense inasmuch as it judges about sensible objects, but
        inasmuch as it apprehends a sensible object, there is not properly truth
        or falsity, except in the relati6n of this apprehension to the judgment,
        in so far as a judgment of this or that sort naturally follows upon a
        particular apprehension.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The judgment of sense about certain things—for example, proper
        sensibles—takes place spontaneously. About other things, however, it
        takes place by means of a certain comparison, made in man by the
        cogitative power, a sense power, whose place in animals is taken by a
        spontaneous estimation. This sensitive power judges about common
        sensibles and accidental sensibles. However, the spontaneous action of a
        thing always takes place in one way, unless by accident it is impeded
        intrinsically by some defect or extrinsically by some impedi ment.
        Consequently, the judgment of sense about proper sensibles is always
        true unless there is an impediment in the organ or in the medium; but
        its judgment about common or accidental sensibles is sometimes wrong.
        Thus, it is clear how there can be falsity in the judgment of sense.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As regards the apprehension of the senses, it must be noted that there
        is one type of apprehensive power, for example, a proper sense, which
        apprehends a sensible species in the presence of a sensible thing; but
        there is also a second type, the imagination, for example, which
        apprehends a sensible species when the thing is absent. So, even though
        the sense always apprehends a thing as it is, unless there is an
        impedimcnt in the organ or in the medium, the imagination usually
        apprehends a thing as it is not, since it apprehends it as present
        though it is absent. Consequently, the Philosopher says: “Imagination,
        not sense, is the master of falsity.”

        1. In the macrocosm the higher bodies do not receive anything from the
        lower. just the opposite occurs. In man, the microcosm, the intellect,
        which is superior, does receive something from sense. Hence, no parallel
        can be made.

        1. The intellect has two operations. By one it forms quiddities, and, as
        the Philosopher says,’ the false is not in this. By the other it joins
        and separates, and the false is not in this either, as is clear from
        Augustine’s saying: “No one has intellectual knowledge of false things.
        Consequently, falsity is not in the intellect.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. According to Augustine: “Whoever is deceived does not understand that
        in which he is deceived. The intellect is always true, therefore, and
        there can be no falsity in it.

        3. Algazel says: “Either we understand something as it is or we do not
        understand. But whoever understands a thing as it is truly understands
        it. Therefore, the intellect is always true, and there is no falsity in
        it.

        The Philosopher says: “Where there is a joining of concepts, there the
        true and the false begin to be.” Hence, falsity is found in the
        intellect.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The name intellect arises from the intellect’s ability to know the most
        profound elements of a thing; for to understand (<i>intelligere</i>)
        means to read what is inside a thing (<i>intus legere</i>). Sense and
        imagination know only external accidents, but the intellect alone
        penetrates to the interior and to the essence of a thing. But even
        beyond this, the intellect, having perceived essences, operates in
        different ways by reasoning and inquiring. Hence, intellect can be taken
        in two senses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        First, it can be taken merely according to its relation to that from
        which it first received its name. We are said to understand, properly
        speaking, when we apprehend the quiddity of things or when we understand
        those truths that are immediately known by the intellect, once it knows
        the quiddities of things. For example, first principles are immediately
        known when we know their terms, and for this reason intellect or
        understanding is called.”a habit of principles.” The proper object of
        the intellect, however, is the quiddity of a thing. Hence, just as the
        sensing of proper sensibles is always true, so the intellect is always
        true in knowing what a thing is, as is said in <i>The Soul</i>. By
        accident, however, falsity can occur in this knowing of quiddities, if
        the intellect falsely joins and separates. This happens in two ways:
        when it attributes the definition of one thing to another, as would
        happen were it to conceive that “mortal rational animal” were the
        definition of an ass; or when it joins together parts of definitions
        that cannot be joined, as would happen were it to conceive that
        “irrational, immortal animal” were the definition of an ass. For it is
        false to say that some irrational animal is immortal. So it is clear
        that a definition cannot be false except to the extent that it implies a
        false affirmation. (This twofold mode of falsity is touched upon in the
        <i>Metaphysics</i>. Similarly, the intellect is not deceived in any way
        with respect to first principles. It is plain, then, that if intellect
        is taken in the first sense—according to that action from which it
        receives the name intellect—falsity is not in the intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Intellect can also be taken in a second sense—in general, that is, as
        extending to all its operations, including opinion and reasoning. In
        that case, there is falsity in the intellect. But it never occurs if a
        reduction to first principles is made correctly.

        From this discussion, the answers to the difficulties are clear.
