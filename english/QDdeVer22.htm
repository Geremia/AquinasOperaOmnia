  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It seems that they do not, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Being is related to the true and to good in the same way since it is
    interchanged with either one. Furthermore, tendency is related to good as
    cognition is to the true. But not every being knows the true. Neither, then,
    does every being tend to good.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2.When the prior is removed the posterior also is removed. But in an animal
    cognition precedes appetitive tendency. Cognition, however, in no sense
    extends to inanimate things so that we could say that they know naturally.
    Neither, then, does appetitive tendency extend to them so that we could say
    that they naturally tend to good.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. According to Boethius’ a thing is said to tend to something else inasmuch
    as it is like it. If, then, something tends to good, it must be like good.
    But since things are alike which have the same quality or form, the form of
    good must be in whatever tends to good. Now it cannot be there according to
    the thing’s real existence, because it would then no longer tend; for what
    someone has he does not seek. The form of good must therefore pre-exist
    intentionally in the being which tends to good. But anything which has
    something else in it in this manner is cognitive. Only in cognitive beings,
    therefore, can there be a tendency to good; and so the conclusion is the
    same as before.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. If all things tend to good, this must be understood of a good which all
    can have, because nothing tends either naturally or rationally to what is
    impossible for it to have. But the only good extending to all beings is
    existence. It is therefore the same to say that all things tend to good as
    that they tend to existence. Now not all things tend to existence; in fact
    it seems that none do, because all have existence and nothing tends except
    to what it does not have, as is made clear by Augustine and the Philosopher.
    Not all things, therefore, tend to good.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. The one, the true, and the good are all equally interchanged with being.
    But not all beings tend to the one and the true. Neither, then, do they tend
    to the good.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. Some people who know the right thing to do act contrary to this
    knowledge, according to the Philosopher.Now they would not this knowledge,
    according so act if they did not desire or will to do so. But what is
    against reason is evil. Some people therefore tend to evil, and so not all
    tend to good.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. The good which all things are said to tend to, as the Commentator says,
    is to be. But some people do not seek to be but rather not to be—the damned
    in hell, for instance, who desire even the death of the soul —so that they
    should not exist at all. Not everything, therefore, seeks good.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. The appetitive powers stand to their objects in just the same relation as
    the apprehensive to theirs. But an apprehensive power has to be devoid of
    the species of its object in order to be able to know, as the pupil of the
    eye must be without color. Hence whatever tends to good must also be devoid
    of the species of good. But everything has the species of good. Therefore
    nothing tends to good.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. To work for an end belongs to the Creator, to nature, and to an agent who
    acts with a purpose. But the Creator and a created agent with a purpose,
    such as man, in working for an end and desiring and loving good, have
    knowledge of the end or good. Then since nature is in a sense intermediate
    between the two, presupposing the work of creation and being presupposed in
    the work of art, if it takes pleasure in seeking the end for which it works,
    it too must know that end. But it does not have knowledge. Then the things
    of nature also do not tend to good.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. Whatever is tended to is sought. But according to Plato, nothing of
    which knowledge is not had can be sought. Thus if anyone were to seek a
    runaway slave without having any knowledge of his appearance, upon finding
    him he would not know that he had done so. Hence things which do not have
    knowledge of good do not tend to it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. To strive for an end belongs to what is directed to an end. But the last
    end, God, is not directed to an end. He does not, then, strive for an end or
    good; and so not everything tends to good.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. A nature is determined to one thing. Then if things naturally tend to
    good, they should not naturally tend to anything else. But all things seek
    peace, as Augustine and Dionysius explain, and also the beautiful, as
    Dionysius also says. Consequently not all things naturally tend to good.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. Just as a person strives for an end when he does not have it, he also
    takes pleasure in it when he has it. But we do not say that inanimate things
    take pleasure in good. Neither, then, should we say that they tend to good.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Dionysius says: “Existents desire the beautiful and the good; and
    whatever they do, they do because it seems good. The intention of all
    existents has as its principle and term the good.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. The Philosopher says” that some have defined good well by saying that it
    is “what all things tend to.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Whatever acts, acts for an end, as is made clear by the Philosopher. But
    whatever acts for something tends to it. Therefore everything tends to an
    end and to good, which has the character of an end. Everything seeks its own
    perfection. But by the fact that a thing is perfect it is good. Everything
    therefore seeks good.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    All things, not only those which have knowledge but also those which are
    without it, tend to good. To understand this it will help to bear in mind
    that some of the ancient philosophers taught that wellsuited effects in
    nature come about from the necessity of their prior causes, though the
    natural causes themselves have not been disposed in that particular way with
    a view to the suitability of the effects.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    With this opinion the Philosopher finds fault ‘14 because according to it,
    unless such suitabilities and aptnesses were in some sense intended, they
    would come about by chance and so would not happen most of the time but only
    rarely, like other things which we say happen by chance. Hence we must say
    that all natural things are ordained and disposed to their well-adapted
    effects.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    There are two ways in which a thing may be ordained or directed to something
    else as its end: (1) by itself, as a man directs himself to the place where
    he is going; and (2) by something else, as an arrow is aimed at a definite
    spot by the archer. Nothing can direct itself to an end unless it knows the
    end, for the one directing must have knowledge of that to which he directs.
    But even things which do not know the end can be directed to a definite end,
    as is evident from the arrow.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This can come about in two ways. (1) Sometimes what is directed to an end is
    merely driven or moved by the one directing it without acquiring from the
    director any form by which such a direction or inclination belongs to it.
    Such an inclination, like that by which the arrow is aimed by the archer at
    a definite target, is violent. (2) Sometimes what is directed or inclined to
    an end acquires from the director or mover some form by which such an
    inclination belongs to it. In that case the inclination will be natural,
    having a natural principle. Thus He who gave heaviness to the stone inclined
    it to be borne downward naturally. In this way the one who begets them is
    the mover in regard to heavy and light things, according to the Philosopher.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It is after this fashion that all natural things are inclined to what is
    suitable for them, having Within themselves some principle of their
    inclination in virtue of which that inclination is natural, so that in a way
    they Igo themselves and are not merely led to their due ends. Things moved
    by violence are only led, because they contribute nothing to the mover. But
    natural things go to their ends inasmuch as they cooperate with the one
    inclining and directing them through a principle implanted in them.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    What is directed or inclined to something by another is inclined to that
    which is intended by the one inclining or directing it. The arrow, for
    example, is directed to the same target at which the archer aims.
    Consequently, since all natural things have been inclined by a certain
    natural inclination toward their ends by the prime mover, God, that to which
    everything is naturally inclined must be what is willed or intended by God.
    But since God can have no end for His will other than Himself and He is the
    very essence of goodness, all other things must be naturally inclined to
    good. To desire or have appetency (<i>appetere</i>) is nothing else but to
    strive for something (<i>ad aliquid petere</i>), stretching, as it were,
    toward something which is destined for oneself.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Accordingly, since all things are destined and directed by God to good, and
    this is done in such a way that in each one is a principle by which it tends
    of itself to good as if seeking good itself, it is necessary to say that all
    things naturally tend to good. If all things were inclined to good without
    having within themselves any principle of inclination, they could be said to
    be led to good, but not to be tending toward it. But in virtue of an innate
    principle all things are said to tend to good as if reaching for it of their
    own accord. For this reason it is said in Wisdom (8: 1) that divine wisdom
    “ordereth all things sweetly” because each one by its own motion tends to
    that for which it has been divinely destined.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. The true and good are somewhat similarly related to being, and also
    somewhat dissimilarly. From the viewpoint of predicative interchangeability
    they are similarly related, for every being is good just as it is true. But
    as perfecting causes they are dissimilarly related; for the true, unlike
    good, does not stand as a perfecting cause to all beings, because the
    perfection of the true is considered from the point of view of the specific
    character only. Only immaterial beings, then, can be perfected by the true,
    because only they can receive the specific character without its material
    act of existing. But good, being perfective both in regard to the specific
    character and in regard to the act of existing, can perfect material beings
    as well as immaterial. All things can accordingly tend to good, but not all
    can know the true.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Some say that there is natural cognition in all things just as there is a
    natural appetitive tendency. But this cannot be true because, in view of the
    fact that cognition is by assimilation, likeness in real existence does not
    bring about cognition but rather hinders it. It is for this reason that the
    sense organs must be devoid of sensible species in order to be able to
    receive them by way of the spiritual existence which causes knowledge. Hence
    those things which in no way receive anything except according to material
    existence can in no way know. Yet they can tend inasmuch as they are
    directed to something having real existence. Appetitive tendency does not
    necessarily look to a spiritual existence as does cognition. Hence there can
    be a natural appetite but not a natural cognition. This still does not
    prevent appetite from following cognition in animals, because even in the
    things of nature it follows apprehension or cognition—not that of the things
    which have the appetite but that of Him who directs them to their end.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Whatever tends to anything tends to it in so far as that thing has some
    likeness to itself. And a likeness in spiritual existence does not suffice;
    otherwise an animal would have to tend to whatever it knows. The likeness
    must be one in real existence. Now this likeness may be taken in two ways:
    (1) in so far as the form of one thing is in another with perfect actuality;
    and in this case there does not follow from likeness to the end a tendency
    to the end, but repose in it; and (2) in so far as the form of one is in
    another incompletely, i.e., potentially; and so, by reason of the potential
    possession of the form of the end and of good, the thing tends to good or
    its end and desires it. It is in this sense, as having form within it
    potentially, that matter is said to desire form. The more, then, that
    potentiality is achieved and brought closer to actuality, the more vigorous
    is the inclination which it causes. This is why any natural motion is
    intensified near the end when the thing tending to the end is more like that
    end.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. When we say that all things tend to good, good is not to be restricted to
    this or that but to be taken in its generality, because each being naturally
    tends to a good suitable to itself. If, notwithstanding, the term good is
    limited to some single good, that will be the act of being. Nor is this
    prevented by the fact that all things have the act of being, because
    whatever has being desires its continuance and what actually has being in
    one way has it only potentially in another. Thus air is actually air and
    potentially fire. And so what actually has being desires to be actually.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. The one and the true do not have the character of an end as does good;
    and so they do not have the character of the appetible either. Even those
    who act contrary to reason are seeking good directly.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. A man who fornicates, for instance, is interested in something good and
    pleasurable to sense. That the act is bad from the viewpoint of reason is
    beyond his intention. Good is accordingly desired directly; evil,
    indirectly.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. A thing is appetible in the same way as it is good. It was said above
    that in its substantial act of being a thing is not called good simply and
    absolutely unless other due perfections are added. The substantial act of
    being is accordingly not appetible in an absolute sense if its due
    perfections are not joined to it. Hence the Philosopher says: “To be is
    delightful to all things.” But we are not to understand an evil and corrupt
    life or a sorrowful one, for this is evil simply and is simply to be
    shunned, though it is appetible in a certain respect. In the matter of
    seeking and shunning, it is all of a piece for a thing to be good and to be
    destructive of evil, or again to be evil and to be destructive of good.
    Hence we call the very lack of evil a good, as the Philosopher points out.
    Non-existence therefore assumes the aspect of a good inasmuch as it takes
    away being in a state of sorrow or wickedness, which is simply evil,
    although it is good in some respect. In this sense non-existence can be
    desired under the aspect of good.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. Concerning apprehensive powers it is not always true that the power is
    altogether devoid of the species of its object. It is false in regard to
    those powers which have a universal object, as in the case of the intellect,
    whose object is the what although it has whatness itself. Yet it must be
    devoid of the forms which it receives. It is false also in regard to touch,
    because, although it has special objects, they nevertheless necessarily
    belong to an animal. Thus its organ cannot be wholly without warmth and
    cold; and yet it is somehow independent of heat and cold, being of an
    intermediate make-up. But what is intermediate is neither of the extremes.
    Now appetitive tendency has a common object, good. Hence it is not
    altogether devoid of good, but just of that good to which it tends. It
    nevertheless has that good potentially and in this respect is like it, just
    as an apprehensive power is in potency to the species of its object.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. As is clear from what has been said, knowledge of the end is required in
    everyone directing anything to an end. Nature, however, does not direct to
    an end but is directed. But God and also any purposeful agent direct to an
    end, and so they must have knowledge of the end, but not a thing of nature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. That argument is correct in regard to a being that tends to an end by
    directing itself towards it, because it has to know when it has reached the
    end. But there is no such necessity in a thing which is merely being
    directed to its end.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. By the same nature by which a thing tends to an end which it does not
    yet have, it delights in an end which it already has. Thus by the same
    nature the element earth moves downward and rests there. Now it is not
    consonant with the last end to tend to an end, but it is consonant with it
    to take pleasure in itself as an end. Though this cannot properly be called
    an appetite, still it is something belonging to the genus of appetite, and
    from it all appetite is derived. For from the fact that God takes pleasure
    in Himself, He directs other things to Himself.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. If appetite terminates in good and peace and the beautiful, this does
    not mean that it terminates in different goals. By the very fact of tending
    to good a thing at the same time tends to the beautiful and to peace. It
    tends to the beautiful inasmuch as it is proportioned and specified in
    itself. These notes are included in the essential character of good, but
    good adds a relationship of what is perfective in regard to other things.
    Whoever tends to good, then, by that very fact tends to the beautiful.
    Peace, moreover, implies the removal of disturbances or obstacles to the
    obtaining of good. By the very fact that something is desired, the removal
    of obstacles to it is also desired. Consequently, at the same time and by
    the same appetitive tendency good, the beautiful, and peace are sought.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. Pleasure includes in its notion knowledge of the good which gives
    pleasure. For this reason only things which know the end can take pleasure
    in an end. But appetitive tendency does not entail knowledge in the being
    which tends, as is evident from what has been said. Nevertheless, using
    pleasure broadly and improperly, Dionysius says that what is beautiful and
    good is found by all to be pleasurable and lovable.

        1. Things are oriented to God as knowable and appetible. But not all
        things oriented to God as knowable know Him, for not all cognitive
        beings know God. Therefore, neither do all things oriented to Him as
        appetible tend to Him.

        2. The good which is desired by all things is, in the opinion of the
        Philosopher, existence, as the Commentator maintains. But God is not the
        existence of all. Then God is not the good which is desired by all.

        3. No one seeks what he flees from. But some people flee from God, as is
        had in the Psalms (73:23): “The pride of them that hate thee ascendeth
        continually.” And Job (21:14) says: “[They] have said to God: Depart
        from us.” Hence not all things seek God.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

        possession of Him, have God. Then not all things seek Him.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. There is a natural appetite only for what can be had. But only a
        rational creature can have God, since it alone is made to the image of
        God and “is the image of God by the very fact of having a capacity for
        Him,” as Augustine says. Not all things, then, naturally seek God.

        1. There is the statement of Augustine: “Whatever can love loves God.”
        But all things can love because all seek good. Then all seek God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Everything naturally tends to the end for which it exists. But all
        things are ordained to God as their end; for as is written in Proverbs
        (16:4): “The Lord hath made all things for himself.” All things,
        therefore, naturally tend to God.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        All things naturally tend to God implicitly, but not explicitly. That
        this may appear clearly it should be observed that a secondary cause can
        influence its effect only in so far as it receives the power of the
        first cause. The influence of an efficient cause is to act; that of a
        final cause is to be sought or desired. A secondary agent acts only by
        the efficacy of the first agent existing in it; similarly a secondary
        end is sought only by reason of the worth of the principal end existing
        in it inasmuch as it is subordinated to the principal end or has its
        likeness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Accordingly, because God is the last end, He is sought in every end,
        just as, because He is the first efficient cause, He acts in every
        agent. But this is what tending to God implicitly, means. For the
        efficacy of the first cause is in the second as the principles of
        reasoning are in the conclusions. But to reduce conclusions to their
        principles or secondary causes to their first causes belongs only to the
        power of reasoning. Hence only a rational nature can trace secondary
        ends back to God by a sort of analytic procedure so as to seek God
        Himself explicitly. In demonstrative sciences a conclusion is correctly
        drawn only by a reduction to first principles. In the same way the
        appetite of a rational creature is correctly directed only by an
        explicit appetitive tendency to God, either actual or habitual.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. All cognitive beings also know God implicitly in any object of
        knowledge. Just as nothing has the note of appetibility except by a
        likeness to the first goodness, so nothing is knowable except by a
        likeness to the first truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Created existence is itself a likeness to the divine goodness. So in
        desiring to be, things implicitly desire a likeness to God and God
        Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. God can be viewed in two ways, in Himself and in His effects. Viewed
        in Himself He cannot but be loved since He is the very essence of
        goodness. Hence He is loved in His essence by all who see Him; and to
        the extent that each one knows Him each loves Him. But viewed in some of
        His effects, e.g., punishment or commands that seem onerous, seeing that
        they are contrary to our will, God is shunned and, in a sense, hated.
        And yet those who hate Him in some of His eff ects necessarily love Him
        in others. Thus even the devils, as Dionysius teaches, naturally desire
        to be and to live, and in this respect seek and love God Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The blessed who already enjoy the possession of God desire the
        continuance of their enjoyment. Furthermore, the enjoyment itself is a
        sort of appetite perfected by its object, although the name appetite
        implies imperfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Only a rational creature has the capacity for God because only it can
        know and love Him explicitly. But other creatures too participate in a
        likeness to God and so tend to Him.

        1. The powers of the soul are ordained only to vital operations. Now
        those operations are called vital by which animate things are
        distinguished from inanimate. But it is not as regards tending that
        animate things are distinguished from inanimate, because even the
        inanimate tend to good. Appetite is therefore not a special power of the
        soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Appetite is nothing, it seems, but a sort of direction to an end. But
        natural appetite suffices for a thing to be directed to an end. So there
        is no necessity of adding an animal appetite which would be a special
        power of the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Operations and powers are differentiated as to their terms. But there
        is the same term, good, for both natural and animal appetite. It is
        therefore the same power or operation. But natural appetite is not a
        power of the soul. Then neither is animal appetite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Appetite is for what is not had, according to Augustine. But in the
        case of animals the good is already had by knowledge. Therefore there
        does not follow upon knowledge among animals any appetite which would
        call for a special power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. A special power is destined for a special act, not for an act corn
        mon to all the powers of the soul. But to tend to good is common to all
        the powers of the soul. This is apparent from the fact that every power
        tends to its object and takes pleasure in it. Therefore appetite is not
        a special power of the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. If the appetitive power tends to good, it tends either to good in
        general or to what is good for itself. Now if it should tend to good in
        general, since every other power tends to some particular good, the
        appetitive power will not be a special power but a universal one. But if
        it tends to what is good for itself, since every other power also tends
        to what is good for itself, every other power can for the same reason be
        called an appetite. There will therefore not be any power of the soul
        which can be called appetite in a special way.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Appetite is a special power of the soul. In this regard it should be
        noted that, since the powers of the soul are destined for operations
        proper to animate beings, an operation has a special power of the soul
        appointed for it for the reason that it is an operation proper to an
        animate being. There is found, indeed, a certain operation which from
        one point of view is common to both animate and inanimate beings but
        from another is proper to animate beings; for instance, to be moved or
        generated.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Spiritual things considered in themselves have such a nature as to move
        but not to be moved. Bodies, however, are moved; and though one can move
        another, still no one of them can move itself. For things which move
        themselves are divided into two parts, one of which is the mover, the
        other, moved, as is shown in the <i>Physics</i>.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But this cannot be realized in purelycorporeal beings, because their
        forms cannot be movers, though they can be the principle of motion in
        the sense of that by which something is moved. In the movement of the
        element earth, for instance, heaviness is the principle by which it is
        moved but yet is not the mover. This is so both because of the
        simplicity of inanimate bodies, which do not have enough diversity in
        their parts for one to originate motion and another to be moved, and
        also because of the baseness and materiality of their forms, which,
        being far removed from the separated forms to which it belongs to move,
        do not retain the ability to move but only the function of being
        principles of motion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Animate things, however, are composed of a spiritual and a corporeal
        nature. There can accordingly be in them a moving part and another
        moved—both locally and in other ways. And so, inasmuch as to be moved is
        made an action proper to animate beings in the sense that they move
        themselves to definite species of movement, there is found in animals a
        hierarchy of special powers. Thus for locomotion in animals there is a
        motive power; and in plants and animals alike, a power of growth for the
        movement of growing, a nutritive power for the movement of alteration,
        and a generative power for the movement of generation. To tend, which is
        in a way common to all things, likewise becomes in a way special for
        animate beings, or rather animals, inasmuch as there are found in them
        appetite and what moves the appetite. This latter, according to the
        Philosopher, is the apprehended good itself. Hence, just as animals more
        than other things are moved of themselves, so too they tend of
        themselves. For this reason the appetitive power is a special faculty in
        the soul in the same way as the motive power.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The solution is clear from what has already been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It is prccisely because animals are capable of participating in
        divine goodness a more eminent way than other, inferior things, that
        they have need of many operations and helps to their perfection. A man
        who can gain perfect health by much exercise is nearer to health than
        one who can attain only a little health and needs for this only a little
        exercise—to use the example given by the Philosopher. Now a natural
        appetite is determined to a single object and cannot be so diversely
        oriented that it extends to as many different things as animals have
        need of. For this reason it was necessary for animals to be supplied in
        addition with an animal appetite consequent upon apprehension so that
        among many objects of apprehension the animal would be attracted to
        different ones.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although good is sought by both natural and animal appetite,
        nevertheless by its natural appetite a thing does not of itself seek
        good as it does by its animal appetite. Consequently for the seeking of
        good by animal appetite there is required a power which is not required
        for the exercise of natural appetite. Furthermore the good to which a
        natural appetite tends is definite and always the same; but this is not
        true of the good sought by an animal appetite. And the same can be
        applied to the motive power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The being which desires a good does not seek to have the good
        according to its intentional existence, as it is had by one who knows
        it, but according to its essential or real existence. Consequently the
        fact that an animal possesses the good by knowing it does not keep it
        from being able to desire it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Every power tends to its object by a natural appetite. But animal
        appetite belongs to a special power. And because natural appetite is
        determined to a single object whereas animal appetite follows
        apprehension, individual powers tend to a determined good but the
        appetitive faculty tends to any good apprehended. Yet it does not follow
        that it is a universal power, since it tends to good in a special way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

        1. An accidental difference in objects does not distinguish powers. But
        the objects of the, will and of the sense appetite are differentiated
        only by accidental differences in good, which is essentially the object
        of appetite. They do not, indeed, seem to differ except inasmuch as the
        will has as its object the good apprehended by the intellect, and sense
        appetite, that apprehended by sense. But these differences are
        accidental to good as such. Therefore the will is not a power distinct
        from sense appetite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Sensitive and intellectual apprehensive powers differ as particular
        and universal, for sense apprehends particulars and intellect
        universals. But the appetite of the sensitive and intellective parts
        cannot be distinguished in this way, because any appetite is for the
        good as it exists in reality. This, however, is not universal but
        singular. The rational appetite—the will—must therefore not be said to
        be a power other than sense appetite as intellect is other than sense.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The motive power follows the appetitive just as the appetitive
        follows apprehension. But the motive power is not one thing in rational
        beings and another in irrational. Then neither is the appetitive. And so
        the conclusion is the same as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The Philosopher distinguishes five kinds of powers and operations of
        the soul. One includes generation, nutrition, and growth; the second is
        sense; the third, appetite; the fourth, locomotion; and the fifth,
        intellect. Intellect is here distinguished from sense, but not
        intellective appetite from sense appetite. It therefore seems that a
        higher appetitive power is not distinguished from a lower as a higher
        apprehensive power is distinguished from a lower.

        appetite is higher than that of sense according to the Philosopher, and
        even moves it “as sphere moves sphere,” as he says in the same place.
        The will is therefore a power other than sense appetite.

        The will is a power distinct from sense appetite. It should be noted in
        this connection that rational appetite is distinguished from that of
        sense in just the same way as sensitive appetite is distinguished from
        that of nature—because of a more perfect way of tending. The closer a
        nature is to God, the more pronounced is the likeness of the divine
        excellence which is found in it. Now it belongs to the divine excellence
        to move and incline and direct all things while not being moved,
        inclined, or directed by any other. Hence the nearer a nature is to God,
        the less it is inclined by another and the more it is capable of
        inclining itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        An insensible nature, therefore, being by reason of its materiality the
        farthest removed from God, is inclined to an end, to be sure, but has
        within it nothing which inclines, but only a principle of inclination,
        as was explained above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A sensitive nature, however, being closer to God, has within itself
        something which inclines, 1.e., the apprehended object of appetite. Yet
        this inclination is not within the control of the animal which is
        inclined but is determined by something else. An animal is not able at
        the sight of something attractive not to crave it, because animals do
        not themselves have the mastery over their own inclination. Hence “they
        do not act but are rather acted upon,” as Damascene says. This is
        because the sensuous appetitive power has a bodily organ and so is
        nearly in the condition of matter and of corporeal things so as rather
        to be moved than to move.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But a rational nature, being closest to God, not merely, like inanimate
        things, has an inclination to something, and, like a sentient nature, a
        mover of this inclination determined as it were extrinsically, but
        further so has its inclination within its own power that it does not
        necessarily incline to anything appetible which is apprehended, but can
        incline or not incline. And so its inclination is not determined for it
        by anything else but by itself. This belongs to it inasmuch as it does
        not use abodily organ; and so, getting farther away from the nature of
        what is moved, it approaches that of what moves and acts. It can come
        about that something determines for itself its inclination to an end
        only if it knows the end and the bearing of the end upon the means to
        it. But this belongs to reason alone. Thus such an appetite, which is
        not determined of necessity by something else, follows the apprehension
        of reason. Hence, rational appetite, called will, is a power distinct
        from sense appetite.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The will is not distinguished from sense appetite directly on the
        basis of the apprehension which it follows but on that of determining
        one’s inclination for oneself or having it determined by another. These
        two sorts of inclination require different kinds of powers. And such a
        diversity further demands a difference in the apprehensions, as appears
        from what has been said. Hence the distinction of the appedtive powers
        is more or less resultantly based upon the distinction of the
        apprehensive, not principally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Although appetite always looks to something existing in reality as a
        particular and not as a universal, nevertheless it is sometimes moved to
        tend by the apprehension of some universal condition. We tend to this
        particular good, for instance, from the consideration of the fact that
        we look upon good as simply to be sought. At other times we tend as a
        result of the apprehension of a particular thing in its particularity.
        Thus appetite is distinguished into universal and particular in a
        secondary sense, Just as it is distinguished in a secondary sense
        according to the difference in the apprehension which it follows.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Motion and operations are found in singulars. But there can be a
        descent from a universal proposition to a particular conclusion only
        through the mediation of a particular assumption. Now in matters of
        operating the choice of a deed is a sort of conclusion, as is said in
        the <i>Ethics</i>. A universal conception of the intellect, accordingly,
        can be applied to the choice of a deed only by means of a particular
        apprehension. Consequently the motion which follows upon a universal
        apprehension of the intellect by means of a particular sense
        apprehension does not require one motive power corresponding to
        intellect and another corresponding to sense, as is true of the appetite
        which follows apprehension immediately. Moreover, the motive power in
        question in the difficulty, that which is commanded, is a power attached
        to the muscles and nerves. Hence it cannot pertain to the intellective
        part, which uses no organ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Because sense and the intellect diff er according to the formal
        aspects of the apprehensible in so far as it is apprehensible, they
        therefore belong to different genera of powers. Sense is concerned with
        apprehending the particular; the intellect, with apprehending the
        universal. But higher and lower appetite are not differentiated by
        differences in the appetible as such, since either appetite sometimes
        tends to the same good. They differ rather in their different ways of
        tending, as is evident from what has been said. Hence they are indeed
        distinct powers but not distinct kinds of powers.

        It seems that it does, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. According to Augustine’ all seek happiness “with a single will.” But
        what is sought by all in common is sought of necessity; for if it were
        not of necessity, it might chance not to be sought by someone. The will
        therefore wills something necessarily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Every cause of motion having perfect efficacy moves its object of
        necessity. But according to the Philosopher good as apprehended is the
        cause of the motion of the will. Therefore, since something is a perfect
        good, viz., God and beatitude, as is said in the <i>Ethics,</i> there
        will be something which will move the will with necessity. And so
        something is desired by the will necessarily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Immateriality is the reason why a given power cannot be forced; for
        powers connected with organs are forced, as appears especially in regard
        to the motive power. But the intellect is a more immaterial power than
        the will. This is clear from the fact that it has a more immaterial
        object, the universal, whereas the object of the will is the good
        existing in particular things. Since, then, the intellect is forced to
        hold something of necessity, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics,</i> it
        seems that the will also tends to something of necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Necessity is removed from the will only by reason of freedom, to
        which necessity seems to be opposed. But not every sort of necessity
        prevents freedom. Hence Augustine says: “If necessity is defined to be
        that according to which we say: ‘It is necessary for something to be or
        to become thus and so, I do not know why we should fear that it will
        take away the freedom of the <i>will.”</i> The will therefore of
        necessity wills something.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <i>5. Necessary</i> means unable not to be. But God is unable not to
        will good just as He is unable not to be good. He therefore necessarily
        wills good; and so some will wills something necessarily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. According to Gregory “a sin which is not wiped out by repentance, by
        its own weight soon draws a person to another.” But a sin is not
        committed unless it is done voluntarily, as Augustine teaches..Since
        drawing is a violent motion, as is made clear in the <i>Physics</i>, one
        can accordingly be violently forced to will something of necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Following Augustine, the Master says: “In the second state (the state
        of guilt) man cannot avoid sinning even mortally before reparation and
        at least venially after reparation.” But both mortal and venial sin are
        voluntary. There is therefore a state of man in which he is unable not
        to will something which constitutes a sin. And so the will of necessity
        wills something.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The more a thing is disposed by nature to cause motion, the more it
        is disposed to impose necessity. But good can cause motion more than
        what is true, since good is in things but what is true is only in
        thought, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics.</i> Therefore, since what is
        true forces the intellect, with all the more reason does good force the
        will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Good makes a stronger impression than truth. This is evident from the
        fact that love, which is the imprint left by the impact of good, is more
        conducive to unity than knowledge, which is the imprint left by the
        impact of truth. For according to Augustine, love is a sort of life
        uniting the lover to the beloved. Good can therefore impose necessity
        upon the will more than truth can upon the intellect. Thus the
        conclusion is the same as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The more power a faculty has over its objects, the less it can be
        forced by them. But reason has more power over its objects than will;
        for according to Augustine, reason forms within itself the species of
        things, and the will does not, but is moved by appetible things. The
        will can therefore be forced by its objects more than reason can by its
        own. And so the same conclusion is reached as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. What is in something essentially is in it of necessity. But to will
        something is in the will essentially. Therefore the will wills something
        of necessity. Proof of the minor: The highest good is willed
        essentially. Therefore whenever the will is directed to it, it wills
        essentially. But then it is always directed to it because it is so
        naturally. Therefore the will always essentially wills the highest good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. In scientific knowledge necessity is found. Now just as all men
        naturally want to know, as the Philosopher says, so too do they
        naturally will good. In willing good necessity is therefore found.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. The Gloss says that the will “naturally wills good.”But things which
        are in something by nature are necessary. Therefore the will necessarily
        wills good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14 Whatever is increased or diminished canalso be taken away entireily.
        But the freedom of the will is increased or diminished, for before the
        fall man had freer choice than after the fall, according to Augustine.”
        The freedom of the will can therefore be taken away entirely. And so the
        will can be forced with necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. According to Augustine, if anything is voluntary, it is not
        necessary. But whatever we will is voluntary. The will therefore does
        not will anything necessarily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Bernard says that free choice is the most powerful thing under God.
        But such a thing cannot be forced by anyone. The will therefore cannot
        be forced to will something of necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Freedom is opposed to necessity. But the will is free. Therefore it
        does not will anything of necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Bernard says that our choice, which is free because of our innate
        will, is moved by no necessity. But the dignity of the will cannot be
        taken away. The will therefore cannot will anything of necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Rational faculties are open to opposites according to the
        Philosopher. But the will is a rational faculty, for it is in reason, as
        is said in <i>The Soul</i>. It is therefore open to opposites, and so it
        is not determined to anything necessarily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Whatever is determined to something of necessity is naturally
        determined to it. But the will is distinguished from natural appetite.
        It therefore does not will anything of necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. From the fact that something is voluntary it is said to be in us in
        such a way that we are masters of it. But we can will or not will
        anything within us of which we are masters. Therefore, whatever the will
        wills it can will or not will. Thus it does not will anything
        necessarily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As can be gathered from the words of Augustine,2 necessity is of two
        kinds: (1) the necessity of force; and this can by no means apply to the
        will; and (2) the necessity of natural inclination, as we say that (sod
        necessarily lives; and with such necessity the will necessarily wills
        something.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For an understanding of this it should be noted that among things
        arranged in an order the first must be included in the second, and in
        the second must be found not only what belongs to it by its own nature
        but also what belongs to it according to the nature of the first. Thus
        it is the lot of man not only to make use of reason, as belongs to him
        in accordance with his specific difference, <i>rational;</i> but also to
        make use of senses and food, as belongs to him in accordance with his
        genus, <i>animal</i> or <i>living being.</i> In like manner we see among
        the senses that the sense of touch is a sort of foundation for the other
        senses and that in the organ of each sense there is found not only the
        distinctive characteristic of the sense whose proper organ it is, but
        also the characteristics of touch. Thus the eye not only senses white
        and black as the organ of sight, but also as the organ of touch senses
        heat and cold and is destroyed by an excess in them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now nature and the will stand in such an order that the will itself is a
        nature, because whatever is found in reality is called a nature. There
        must accordingly be found in the will not only what is proper to the
        will but also what is proper to nature. It belongs to any created
        nature, however, to be ordained by God for good, naturally tending to
        it. Hence even in the will there is a certain natural appetite for the
        good corresponding to it. And it has, moreover, the tendency to
        something according to its own determination and not from necessity.
        This belongs to it inasmuch as it is the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Just as there is an ordination of nature to the will, there is,
        moreover, a parallel ordination of the things which the will naturally
        wills to those in regard to which it is determined of itself and not by
        nature. Thus, just as nature is the foundation of will, similarly the
        object of natural appetite is the principle and foundation of the other
        objects of appetite. Now among the objects of appetite the end is the
        foundation and principle of the means to the end, because the latter,
        being for the sake of the end, are not desired except: by reason of the
        end. Accordingly what the will necessarily wills, determined to it by a
        natural inclination, is the last end, happiness, and whatever is
        included in it: to be, knowledge of truth, and the like. But it is
        determined to other things, not by a natural inclination, but by so
        disposing itself without any necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Although the will wills the last end by a certain necessary inclination,
        it is nevertheless in no way to be granted that it is forced to will it.
        For force is nothing else but the infliction of some violence. According
        to the Philosopher that is violent “whose principle is outside it with
        the being which suffers the violence contributing nothing.” The throwing
        of a stone upward would be an example, because the stone of itself is
        not at all inclined to that motion. But seeing that the will is an
        inclination by the fact of its being an appetite, it cannot happen that
        the will should will anything without having an inclination to it. Thus
        it is impossible for the will to will anything by force or violently
        even though it does will something by a natural inclination. It is
        therefore evident that the will does not will anything necessarily with
        the necessity of force, yet it does will something necessarily with the
        necessity of natural inclination.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. That common appetite for happiness does not come from any forcing but
        from a natural inclination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. However effectively a good moves the will, it still cannot force it;
        because as soon as we posit that the will wills something, we posit that
        it has an inclination to it. But that is the contrary of force. It does
        happen, however, that because of the excellence of a good the will is
        determined to it by an inclination of natural necessity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The intellect naturally understands something just as the will
        naturally wills. But force is not contrary to the intellect in its very
        notion as it is to the will. For although the intellect has an
        inclination to something, it nevertheless does not designate a man’s
        inclination itself, whereas the will does designate the very inclination
        of the man. Hence whatever happens according to the will happens
        according to the man’s inclination and so cannot be violent. But the
        operation of the intellect can be against a man’s inclination, his will.
        This occurs, for instance, when a certain opinion pleases him but
        because of the force of the arguments he is brought by his intellect to
        assent to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Augustine is speaking of natural necessity, which we do not exclude
        from the will in regard to certain things. This necessity is also found
        in the divine will just as it is found in the divine existence; for God
        is necessary essentially, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics.</i>

        6. A sin committed does not draw a man by forcing his will but by
        inclining it, inasmuch as it deprives the man of the grace by which he
        is strengthened against sin, and also inasmuch as there is left in the
        soul from the act of sinning a disposition or habit inclining it to
        subsequent sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7.On this point there are two opinions. Some say that however much a man
        may be in the state of mortal sin, he can avoid mortal sin by the
        freedom of his will. They explain the statement that man cannot avoid
        sinning to mean that he cannot avoid having sin, just as
        <i>to see</i> means to have sight as well as to make use of sight. But
        in their opinion he is able not to sin, meaning not to make use of sin.
        And it is accordingly evident that no necessity of consenting to sin is
        introduced into the will. Others say that, just as a man in the state of
        this present life cannot avoid venial sin, not in the sense that he is
        unable to avoid this or that particular venial sin, but in the sense
        that he cannot avoid all venial sins so as not to commit a single one,
        the same is also true of mortal sins in a man who does not have grace.
        And in accordance with this opinion it is clear that the will is not
        necessitated to will this or that mortal sin, although when without
        grace it is found to fall short of an unwavering inclination to good.

        8. A form received into something does not move the recipient, but the
        very having of such a form means that it has, been moved. It is,
        however, inoved by an external agent. Thus a body which is heated by
        fire is not moved by the heat received but by the fire. So too the
        intellect is not moved by the species already received or by the true
        knowledge which is consequent upon the species, but by some external
        thing which influences the intellect—the agent intellect or a phantasm
        or something else of the sort. Moreover, just as truth is proportioned
        to the understanding, so too is good proportioned to the affection.
        Hence because truth is in our apprehension, it is not for that reason
        any less capable of moving our understanding than good our affection.
        And furthermore, the fact that the will is not forced by a good does not
        come from the insufficiency of the good for moving butfrom the very
        nature of willing, as is apparent from what has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. From the above answer the answer here too is evident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. A thing which is external to the soul does not imprint its species
        upon the possible intellect except through the operation of the agent
        intellect. On this account the soul is said to form within itself the
        forms of things. In like manner it is not without the operation of the
        will that the will tends to its object. The argument is accordingly not
        conclusive. And besides, the same answer can be given as was given to
        the two preceding difficulties.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. The first good is essentially willed, and the will essentially and
        naturally wills it. Nevertheless it does not always actually will it,
        for is not necessary that the things which are naturally associated with
        the soul are always actually in the soul, just as principles which are
        naturally known are not always actually being considered.

        12. The necessity by which we know something necessarily in scientific
        knowledge and that by which of necessity we desire knowledge do not
        belong to the same kind of necessity. The former can be the necessity of
        force, but the latter can be only a necessity of natural inclination. It
        is in this way that the will necessarily wills good inasmuch as it
        naturally wills it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. From the above answer this answer also is clear.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. The freedom which is increased and diminished is freedom from sin
        and from misery, not freedom from force. Hence it does not follow that
        the will can be brought to such a pass that it is forced.

        1. That authoritative statement is to be understood of the necessity of
        force, which is repugnant to the will, not of the necessity of natural
        inclination, which, according to Augustine, is not repugnant to the
        will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. It is not due to the weakness of the will if it is directed to
        something of necessity by a natural inclination but rather to its
        strength, just as a heavy body is the stronger, the greater the
        necessity with which it is borne downward. But it would be due to it
        eakness if it were forced by another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Freedom is opposed to the necessity of force, according to Augustine,
        but not to the necessity of natural inclination.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Natural necessity is not repugnant to the dignity of the will, but
        only the necessity of force.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Inasmuch as the will is rational it is open to opposites. This is to
        consider it according to what is distinctive of it. But from the
        viewpoint of its being a nature nothing prevents it from being naturally
        determined to one object.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The will is distinguished from natural appetite in a precisive sense,
        1.e., an appetite which is only natural, just as man is distinguished
        from what is only animal. It is not distinguished from natural appetite
        in an absolute sense, but includes it, just as man includes animal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. This argument also is based upon the will taken as will. For it is
        characteristic of the will as will to be master of its own acts.

        1 The nobler a thing is, the more unchangeable it is. But to live is
        nobler than to be; to understand, nobler than to live; and to will,
        nobler than to understand. Therefore to will is more unchangeable than
        to be. But the being of a soul that wills is unchangeable because it is
        incorruptible. Therefore its willing is also unchangeable; and so
        whatever it wills, it wills unchangeably and necessarily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The more conformed a thing is to God, the more unchangeable it is.
        But the soul is more conformed to God by secondary conformity, which is
        that of likeness, than by primary conformity, which is that of an image.
        But in its primary conformity the soul has unchangeableness because it
        cannot lose its image, according to the words of the Psalm (38:7): “Man
        passeth as an image.” Then according to secondary conformity, which is
        that of a likeness consisting in the due ordering of the will, it will
        also have unchangeableness so that the will will unchangeably will good
        and cannot will evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Potency stands to potential being as act to actualbeing. But God,
        being actually good, cannot actually do anything evil. Therefore His
        power, which is good, also cannot produce anything which is evil
        potentially; and thus the will, which the divine power has produced,
        cannot tend to evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. According to the Philosopher’ in matters of operation and appetency
        ends are related to means just as in demonstrative sciences principles
        are to conclusions. But from principles that are naturally known
        necessity is imposed upon the intellect so that it knows conclusions
        necessarily. Then from the fact that the will necessarily wills the last
        end in the way already explained, it will of necessity will all other
        things which are directed to the ultimate end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Whatever is naturally determined to something necessarily attains it
        unless something interferes. But the will “naturally wills good,” as is
        said in the Gloss. It therefore unchangeably wills good, since there is
        nothing to stop it, seeing that it is “the most powerful” thing under
        God, as Bernard teaches.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Evil is opposed to good as darkness to light. But sight, which is
        naturally determined to know light and what is lighted, sees them
        naturally so as to be unable to see what is dark. Then the will, whose
        object is the good, so unchangeably wills good that it can in no way
        will evil. And so the will has some necessity not only in regard to the
        last end but also in regard to other things.

        1. Augustine says: “It is by the will that one sins or lives correctly.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. According to Augustine “sin is voluntary to such an extent that if it
        is not voluntary it is not a sin.” If, then, sin is not at all from the
        will, there will not be any sin at all. But it is evident from
        experience that that is false.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Something is said to be necessary from the fact that it is unchangeably
        determined to one thing. Since, therefore, the will stands undetermined
        in regard to many things, it is not under necessity in regard to
        everything but only in regard to those things to which it is determined
        by a natural inclination, as has been said <i>.</i> And because
        everything mobile is reduced to what is immobile as its principle, and
        everything undetermined, to what is determined, that to which the will
        is determined must be the principle of tending to the things to which it
        is not determined; and this is the last end, as has been said
        <i>.</i> Now there is found to be indetermination of the will in regard
        to three things: its object, its act, and its ordination to its end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In regard to its object the will is undetermined as to the means to the
        end, not as to the last end itself, as has been said. This is so because
        there are many ways of reaching the last end, and for different people
        different ways prove suitable. The appetite of the will could not, then,
        be determined to the means to the end as is the appetite in natural
        things, which have definite and fixed ways of reaching a definite and
        fixed end. And so it is evident that natural things not only desire the
        end necessarily, but also desire the means in the same way, so diat
        there are among the means none to which natural things can cither tend
        or not. The will, however, necessarily desires the last end in such a
        way that it is unable not to desire it, but it does not necessarily
        desire any of the means. In their regard, then, it is within the Power
        of the will to desire this or that.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the second place the will is undetermined in regard to its act,
        because even concerning a determined object it can perform its act or
        not perform it when it wishes. It can pass or not pass into the act of
        willing with regard to anything at all. This is not true of natural
        things, for something heavy always actually goes down unless something
        else prevents it. This is the case because inanimate things do not move
        themselves but are moved by other things. There is in them, then, no
        ability to be moved or not to be moved. But animate things are their own
        source of movement. Hence it is that the will can will or not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A third indetermination of the will is found in regard to its ordination
        to its end inasmuch as the will can desire what is in truth directed to
        its appointed end or what is so only in appearance. This indetermination
        comes from two sources: from the indetermination in regard to its object
        in the case of the means, and again from the indetermination of our
        apprehension, which can be correct or not. From a given true principle a
        false conclusion does not follow unless it is because of some falsity in
        the reasoning through a false subsumption or the false relating of the
        principle to the conclusion. In the same way from a correct appetite for
        the last end the inordinate desire for something could not follow unless
        reason were to take as referable to the end something which is not so
        referable. Thus a person who naturally desires happiness with a correct
        appetite would never be led to desire fornication except in so far as he
        apprehends it as a good for man, seeing that it is something
        pleasurable, and as referable to happiness as a sort of copy of it. From
        this there follows the indetermination of the will by which it can
        desire good or evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Since the will is said to be free inasmuch as it is not necessitated,
        the freedom of the will can be viewed in three respects: (1) as regards
        its act, inasmuch as it can will or not will; (2) as regards its object,
        inasmuch as it can will this or that, even if one is the opposite of the
        other; and (3) as regards its ordination to the end, inasmuch as it can
        will good or evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In regard to the first of these three there is freedom in the will in
        any state of nature with reference to any object, for the act of any
        will is in its power as regards any object. The second of these is had
        with reference to some objects, the means and not the end itself. This
        too holds for any state of nature. The third is not with reference to
        all objects but only certain ones, the means to the end, and not with
        reference to any state of nature but only that in which nature can fail.
        Where there is no failure in apprehending and comparing, there can be no
        willing of evil even when there is question of means, as is clear among
        the blessed. For this reason it is said that to will evil is not freedom
        or any part of it, though it is a sign of freedom.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The act of being of the soul is not determined for it by itself but
        by another, but it does determine its own act of willing. Thus, although
        its being is unchangeable, still its willing is undetermined and so can
        be directed to different things. It is not true, however, that to
        understand or to will is nobler than to be if they are discriminated
        from being. Rather being is then nobler than they, according to
        Dionysius.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The conformity of an image is viewed from the standpoint of natural
        powers, which are determined for the thing by nature. And so that
        conformity always remains. But secondary conformity, that of likeness,
        is had by grace and the habits and acts of the virtues, to which the
        soul is directed by an act of the will which stands within its power.
        That conformity, then, does not always remain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In God there is no passive or material potency to be distinguished
        from act, as is supposed in the objection; but there is active potency,
        which is the act itself, because a being is capable of acting inasmuch
        as it is in act. And yet the ability of the will to be directed to evil
        does not come from the fact of its being from God but from that of its
        being made out of nothing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. In demonstrative sciences conclusions are so related to principles
        that when the conclusion is removed the principle is removed. And so
        from this fixity of the conclusions with regard to the principles the
        intellect is forced by the principles themselves to assent to the
        conclusions. But the means do not have with regard to the end such a
        fixity that upon the removal of any one of them the end is removed,
        since it is possible to attain the last end in various ways either
        really or apparently. Consequently, from the necessity which is in the
        voluntary appetite in regard to the end, there is not imposed upon it
        any necessity in regard to the means.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The will naturally wills good but not this or that particular good.
        It is like sight, which naturally sees color but not this or that
        particular color. For this reason whatever the will wills it wills under
        the aspect of good; yet it does not always have to will this or that
        good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Nothing is so evil that it cannot have some aspect of good; and it is
        by reason of that goodness that it can move the appetite.

        In willing what he naturally wills a person merits in a certain sense
        and in a certain sense does not. For the explanation of this it should
        be observed that there is a difference in the way in which providence is
        exercised in regard to man and in regard to the other animals both as to
        his body and as to his soul. For other animals are provided with special
        coverings for their bodies, such as a tough hide, feathers, and the
        like, and also special weapons, such as horns, claws, and so forth. This
        is because they have just a few ways of acting to which they can adapt
        definite instruments. But man is provided with those things in a general
        way inasmuch as there has been given to him by nature hands by which he
        is able to prepare for himself a variety of coverings and protections.
        This is because man’s reason is so manifold and extends to so many
        different things that definite tools sufficient for him could not be
        provided for him ahead of time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The case is similar in regard to apprehension. Other animals have innate
        in them in the line of natural discretion certain specific conceptions
        necessary for them, as a sheep has a natural realization that a wolf is
        its enemy, and so on. But in place of these there are implanted in man
        certain naturally understood universal principles by means of which he
        can go on to [figure out] everything that is necessary for him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In regard to their appetitive tendency also the same holds true. In
        other things there is implanted a natural appetite for something
        definite, as in a heavy body, to be down, and in every animal, whatever
        suits it according to its nature. But man has implanted in him an
        appetite for his last end in general so that he naturally desires to be
        complete in goodness. But in just what that completeness consists,
        whether in virtues or knowledge or pleasure or anything else of the
        sort, has not been determined for him by nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        When, therefore, by his own reason with the help of divine grace he
        grasps as his happiness any particular good in which his happiness
        really does consist, then he merits, not because he desires happiness
        (which he naturally desires), but because he desires this particular
        good (which he does not naturally desire)—for example, the vision of
        God, in which his happiness does in truth consist. But if anyone were by
        erroneous reasoning to be brought to desire as his happiness some
        particular good—for example, bodily pleasures, in which his happiness
        does not in fact consist—he incurs demerit by so desiring. This is not
        because he desires happiness, but because he unwarrantedly desires as
        his happiness this particular thing in which his happiness is not found.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is therefore clear that willing what anyone naturally wills is in
        itself neither meritorious nor blameworthy. But when it is specified to
        this or that, it can be either the one or the other. In this way the
        saints merit by desiring God and eternal life.

        is said in Proverbs (2 1:1), “The heart of the king is in the hand of

        2. Quoting Augustine on Romans (1:24): “Wherefore, God gave them up to
        the desires of their heart...” the Gloss says. “It is evident that God
        works in the hearts of men to incline their wills to whatever He wishes,
        whether to good, according to His mercy, or to evil, according to their
        deserts.” God can accordingly force the will.

        3. If a finite being acts finitely, an infinite being will act
        infinitely. But a finite creature attracts the will in a finite way,
        because, as Cicero says, the honorable is what attracts us by its own
        vigor and entices us by its own excellence. Therefore God, who has
        infinite efficacy in acting, can therefore force the will.

        4. He is properly said to be forced to something who is unable not to do
        it whether he wants to or not. But the will is unable not to will what
        God by His will of good pleasure wants it to will; otherwise the will of
        God would be inefficacious in regard to our will. God can therefore
        force the will.

        5. In any creature there is perfect obedience to the Creator. But the

        therefore cannot make the will do anything by force; and so He cannot
        force the will.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        God can change the will with necessity but nevertheless cannot force it.
        For however much the will is moved toward something, it is not said to
        be forced to it. The reason for this is that to will something is to be
        inclined to it. But force or violence is contrary to the inclination of
        the thing forced. When God moves the will, then, He causes an
        inclination to succeed a previous inclination so that the first
        disappears and the second remains. Accordingly, that to which He induces
        the will is not contrary to an inclination still extant but merely to
        one that was previously there. This is not, then, violence or force.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The case is parallel to that of a stone, in which by reason of its
        heaviness there is an inclination downward. While this inclination
        remains, if the stone is thrown upward, violence is done it. But if God
        were to subtract from the stone the inclination of its heaviness and
        give it an inclination of lightness, then it would not be violent—for
        the stone to be borne upward. Thus a change of motion can be had without
        violence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is in this way that God’s changing of the will without forcing it is
        to be understood. God can change the will because He works within it
        just as He works in nature. Now, just as every natural action is from
        God, so too every action of the will, in so far as it is an action, not
        only is from the will as its immediate agent but also is from God as its
        first agent, who influences it more forcefully. Then, just as the will
        can change its act to something else, as is apparent from the
        explanation above, so too and much more can God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        God changes the will in two ways. (1) He does it merely by moving it.
        This occurs, for instance, when He moves the will to want something
        without introducing any form into the will. Thus He sometimes without
        the addition of any habit causes a man to want what he did not want
        before. (2) He does it by introducing some form into the will itself. By
        the very nature which God gave the will He inclines it to will
        something, as is clear from what has been said. Now in like fashion by
        something additional, such as grace or a virtue, the soul is inclined to
        will something to which it was not previously determined by a natural
        inclination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This additional inclination is sometimes perfect, sometimes imperfect.
        When it is perfect it causes a necessary inclination to the thing to
        which it determines the will, in the same way as the will is inclined by
        nature necessarily to desire the end. This happens among the blessed,
        whom perfect charity sufficiently inclines to good not only as regards
        the last end but also as regards the means to this end. Sometimes,
        however, the additional form is not in all respects perfect, as among
        the wayfarers on earth. Then the will is indeed inclined by reason of
        the additional form, but not necessarily.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From what has just been said the answers are clear. For the first set of
        arguments go to prove that God can change the will; the second, that He
        cannot force it. Both of these are true, as is evident from the
        explanation above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It should, however, be noted that, when it is said in the Gloss as cited
        that God works in the hearts of men to incline their wills to evil, this
        is not to be understood (as the Gloss itself says in the same place) as
        if God bestowed wickedness, but in the sense that, just as He confers
        grace by which men’s wills are inclined to good, He also withdraws it
        from some; and when it is thus withdrawn, their wills are bent to evil.

        move the lower with a certain natural order. But not only the intellect

        ours. Therefore, just as they can influence our intellect by theirs by
        enlightening it, according to the teaching of Dionysius, so also it
        seems that by their will they can influence our will by changing it in
        some way.

        5. According to Dionysius, the higher angels enlighten, cleanse, and

        6. A thing is naturally more disposed to be changed by a higher nature
        than by a lower. But just as sense appetite is inferior to our will, the

        changes our will, with all the more reason will the angelic will be able

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The will can be understood to be changed by something in two ways. (1)
        This is referred to its object. In this sense the will is changed by the
        appetible thing. But nothing which changes the will in this way is in
        question here; for that was treated above,where it was shown that a
        certain good does move the will with necessity (in the way in which the
        object moves it), though the will is not forced. (2) The will can be
        taken to be moved by something in the manner of an efficient cause. In
        this sense we say that not only can no creature by acting upon the will
        force it (for even God could not do this), but also it cannot even act
        upon the will directly so as to change it with necessity or in any way
        to incline it (which God can do). But indirectly a creature can in some
        way incline the will though not change it with necessity. The reason for
        this is that, since the act of the will mediates as it were between the
        power and its object, a change in the act can be considered either from
        the point of view of the will or from that of the object.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From the point of view of the will only what works inside the will can
        change the act of the will. This is the will itself and that which is
        the cause of the being of the will, which according to the faith is God
        alone. Consequently only God can transfer the act of the will which He
        has made, from one thing to another as He wishes. But according to those
        who hold that the soul was created by intelligences (which is in fact
        contrary to the faith), the angel or intelligence itself has an effect
        intrinsic to the will, since it causes the act of being which is
        intrinsic to the will. Avicenna accordingly maintainsP that our wills
        are changed by the will of the heavenly souls just as our bodies are
        changed by the heavenly bodies. This is, however, thoroughly heretical.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But if the act of will is considered from the point of view of the
        object, the object of the will is found to be twofold. There is one to
        which the natural inclination of the will is determined with necessity.
        This object is implanted in the will and proposed to it by the Creator,
        who gave it its natural inclination to this. Consequently no one can
        change the will necessarily by means of such an object except God alone.
        But there is another object of the will capable of inclining the will
        inasmuch as there is in it some likeness or ordination with regard to
        the last end which is naturally desired. And yet the will is not changed
        necessarily by this object, as was said above, because there is not
        found in it alone an ordination to the naturally desired last end. Now
        by means of this object a creature can incline the will to some extent
        but not change it in a necessary way. This is the case when someone
        persuades another to do something by proposing to him its usefulness or
        nobility. It nonetheless remains within the power of the will to accept
        it or not, seeing that it is not determined to it by nature.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is accordingly apparent that no creature can directly change the will
        as if by acting within the will itself; but by proposing something to
        the will extrinsically it can in some way induce it, though not change
        it necessarily.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The will can change itself in regard to certain things even directly,
        since it is master of its acts. And when we say that it cannot be
        changed directly by a creature, we mean by another creature. Still it
        cannot force itself, because to say that anything is forced by itself
        implies a contradiction, since that is violent in which the patient
        contributes nothing; but the one who exerts force does contribute
        something. And so the will cannot force itself, because in applying the
        force it would thus be contributing something inasmuch as it would force
        itself, and contributing nothing inasmuch as it would be forced. And
        this is impossible. It is in this way that the Philosopher proves that
        no one suffers anything unjust from himself, because anyone who suffers
        something unjust suffers against his will; but if he does something
        unjust, that is according to his will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Heavenly bodies cannot with necessity change the will either of one
        man or of a crowd, but they can change their bodies. And by means of the
        body the will is in some way inclined, though not necessarily since it
        can resist. Choleric persons, for example, are inclined by their natural
        temperament to wrath; yet a choleric person can resist that inclination
        by his will. But only the wise resist bodily inclinations; and they are
        few in comparison with the foolish, because according to Ecclesiastes
        (1:15) “the number of fools is infinite.” Consequently it is said that
        heavenly bodies change a crowd inasmuch as the crowd follows bodily
        inclinations; but they do not change this or that individual who with
        prudence resists the inclination mentioned.

        3. An incontinent person is not said to be bound by his passions as if
        the bodily passions forced or necessitated his will; otherwise an
        incontinent person should not be punished, because punishment is not
        deserved for what is involuntary. Now the incontinent man is not said to
        act involuntarily, according to the Philosopher, but he is said to be
        bound by his passions inasmuch as he voluntarily yields to their urge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Angels influence the intellect by acting upon it interiorly but only
        from the viewpoint of the object, because they propose the intelligible
        object by which our intellect is actuated and won over to assent. But
        the object of the will proposed by an angel does not change the will of
        necessity, as has been said. Thus there is no parallel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. That cleansing which the angels undergo applies to the intellect, for
        it is a cleansing from ignorance, as Dionysius says. But even if it did
        apply to the affections, it would be used in the sense of persuading.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. What is inferior to the will, as the body or sense appetite, does not
        change the will by acting upon it directly but only from the point of
        view of its object. For the object of the will is the apprehended good.
        But the good apprehended by universal reason moves the will only through
        the mediation of a particular apprehension, as is said in
        <i>The Soul</i>, since acts are performed in individual cases. Now by
        the passion of the sense appetite, the cause of which can sometimes be
        the bodily make-up or anything undergone by the body from the fact that
        sense appetite uses an organ, the particular apprehension itself is
        impeded and sometimes entirely inhibited so that what higher reason
        dictates in a universal way is not actually applied to this particular
        case. And so in its appetitive tendency the will is moved to that good
        which the particular apprehension reports to it, passing up the good
        which universal reason reports. In this way such passions incline the
        will; yet they do not change it with necessity, because it remains
        within the power of the will to restrain such passions so that the use
        of reason is not prevented, in accordance with the words of Genesis
        (4:7): “But the lust thereof shall be under thee,” namely, that of sin.

        It seems that they are, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Powers are distinguished on the basis of their objects. Now the
        object of the intellect is the true, that of the will, the good. Since
        the good and the true are identical as to their real subject and differ
        in formal character, it therefore seems that the intellect and the will
        are really identical and differ only in formal character.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. According to the Philosopher, the will is in reason. It is therefore
        either the same as reason or a part of reason. But reason is the same
        power as the intellect. Then so is the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The faculties of the soul are commonly divided into the rational, the
        concupiscible, and the irascible. But the will is distinguished from the
        irascible and the concupiscible. It is therefore contained within the
        rational.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Wherever there is found an object which is the same in reality and in
        formal character, there is a single power. But the object of the will
        and of the practical intellect is the same in reality and in formal
        character, for the object of both is the good. Therefore the practical
        intellect is not a power different from the will. But the speculative
        intellect is not a power different from the practical because, according
        to the Philosopher,by extension the speculative intellect becomes
        practical. Therefore the will and the intellect (taken simply) are a
        single power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. To know the difference of two things from one another it is necessary
        for the same person to know both of the things differentiated. Similarly
        it must be the same person who knows and wills. But for the knowing of
        the difference between any two things, as “between white and sweet,” it
        must be the same power which knows both. From this the Philosopher
        proves the existence of the central sense. By the same reasoning, then,
        it must be a single power which knows and wills; and so the intellect
        and the will are a single power, so it seems.

        1. The appetitive genus of powers of the soul is different from the
        intellective according to the Philosopher. But the will is listed under
        the appetitive. The will is therefore a power different from the
        intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The intellect can be forced, according to the Philosopher. But the
        will cannot be forced, as has been said. The intellect and the will are
        therefore not one and the same power.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The will and the intellect are distinct powers, even belonging to
        different genera of powers. That this may be clearly understood it
        should be noted that, since the distinction of powers is taken from the
        acts and objects, not just any difference at all among the objects
        reveals the distinctness of the powers but a difference in the objects
        precisely inasmuch as they are objects; and this will not be an
        accidental difference—I mean one which merely happens to be connected
        with the object taken specifically as object. It merely happens to the
        object of sense, for instance, inasmuch as it is sensible, to be animate
        or inanimate, though these differences are essential for the things
        which are sensed. It is accordingly not from these differences that the
        sense powers are diversified, but according as their objects are
        audible, visible, or tangible (for these are differences in the sensible
        inasmuch as it is sensible); that is to say, according to whether the
        objects are sensible through a medium or without a medium.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now when essential differences of objects as objects are taken as
        dividing some specific object of the soul of themselves, by this fact
        powers are diversified but not genera of powers. Thus
        <i>the sensible</i> designates, not the object of the soul without
        qualification, but an object which of itself is divided by the aforesaid
        differences. Hence sight, hearing, and touch are distinct specific
        powers belonging to the same genus of powers of the soul, 1.e., to
        sense. But when the differences considered divide the object taken in
        general, then from such a difference distinct genera of powers become
        known.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Something is said to be an object of the soul according as it has some
        relation to the soul. Hence, where we find different aspects of
        relatedness to the soul, there we find an essential difference in the
        object of the soul, and this indicates a distinct genus of the soul’s
        powers. Now a thing is found to have a twofold relationship to the soul:
        one by which the thing itself is in the soul in the soul’s manner and
        not in its own, the other by which the soul is referred to the thing in
        its own existence. Thus something is an object of the soul in two ways.
        (1) It is so inasmuch as it is capable of being in the soul, not
        according to its own act of being, but according to the manner of the
        soul—spiritually. This is the essential constituent of the knowable. in
        so far as it is knowable. (2) Something is the object of the soul
        according as the soul is inclined and oriented to it after the manner of
        the thing itself as it is in itself. This is the essential constituent
        of the appetible in so far as it is appetible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The cognitive and appetitive principles in the soul accordingly
        constitute distinct genera of powers. Hence, since the intellect is
        included in the cognitive, and the will in the appetitive, the will and
        the intellect must be powers that are distinct even generically.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The distinction of powers is not manifested by the objects taken
        according to their reality but according to their formal aspect, because
        the formal aspects of the objects specify the operations of the powers.
        And so where there is a different formal aspect of the object, there we
        find a different power, even though it is the same thing which has the
        two formal aspects, as is the case with good and the true. This is also
        verified in material things. Air is modified by fire inasmuch as fire is
        hot, in view of the fact that air is potentially hot. But inasmuch as
        fire is luminous, air is modified by it in view of the fact that air is
        transparent. Nor is it the same potency in air by which it is called
        transparent and by which it is called potentially hot, even though it is
        the same fire which acts upon both potencies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. A power can be considered in two ways: either in reference to the
        object or in reference to the essence of the soul in which it is rooted.
        If the will is considered in reference to its object, it then belongs to
        a different genus from intellect. In this way will is distinguished from
        reason and intellect, as has been said. But if the will is considered
        according to that in which it is rooted, then since the will, like the
        intellect, does not have a bodily organ, the will and the intellect are
        reduced to the same part of the soul. In this way the intellect or
        reason is sometimes taken as including both within it, and then the will
        is said to be in reason. On this basis the rational part, including both
        the intellect and the will, is distinguished from the irascible and the
        concupiscible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. From the above answer this also is clear.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The object of the practical intellect is not the good, but the true
        which is related to operation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. To will and to know are not acts of the same formal character, and so
        they cannot belong to the same power as can knowledge of what is sweet
        and what is white. Hence there is no parallel.

        It seems that the intellect is the nobler and higher, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. The nobility of the soul consists in its being made to the image of
        God. But the soul is made to the image of God in virtue of reason or
        intelligence. Hence Augustine says: “Let us understand that man is made
        to the image of God in that particular in which he excels irrational
        animals; but that is reason, mind, or intelligence, or whatever it may
        more appropriately be called.” Therefore the most excellent power of the
        soul is the intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The answer was given that the image is in the will as well as in the
        intellect, since according to Augustine, the image is seen in memory,
        intelligence, and will.—On the contrary, when the nobility of the soul
        is considered from the standpoint of the image, that in which the notion
        of image is most properly verified must be the most excellent part of
        the soul. Now even if the image is in both the will and the intellect,
        it is more properly in the intellect than in the will. Hence the Master
        of the <i>Sentences</i> says that the image is in the knowledge of truth
        and merely a likeness in the love of good. Therefore the intellect must
        still be nobler than the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Since we judge of the powers from their acts, that power must be the
        nobler whose act is the nobler. But to understand is nobler than to
        will. Therefore the intellect is nobler than the will. Proof of the
        minor: Since acts are specified by their terms, that act must be nobler
        whose term is nobler. But the act of the intellect involves a motion to
        the soul; that of the will, from the soul to things. Since the soul is
        nobler than external things, to understand is therefore nobler than to
        will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Among all things arranged in an order the more distant anything is
        from the lowest member, the higher it is. But the lowest among the
        powers of the soul is sense, and the will stands closer to sense than
        does the intellect. For the will shares with the sense powers the
        condition of its object, because the will is concerned with particulars
        just as is sense. We wish for a particular health and not health as
        something universal. But the intellect is concerned with universals. The
        intellect is therefore a higher power than the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. That which rules is nobler than the thing ruled. But the intellect
        rules the will. Therefore it is nobler than the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. That from which something comes has authority over it and is greater
        than it if it is distinct in essence. But intelligence is from memory as
        the Son from the Father, and will is from memory and intelligence as the
        Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son. Intelligence therefore has
        authority in regard to the will and is greater and stronger than it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The simpler and more immaterial an act is, the nobler it is. But the
        act of the intellect is simpler and more immaterial than that of the
        will, because the intellect abstracts from matter, but not the will. The
        act of the intellect is therefore nobler than that of the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The intellect bears to the soul the same relation as brightness to
        material things, and the will or affective power, that of warmth, as
        appears from the sayings of the saints. But brightness is nobler than
        warmth, since it is the quality of a nobler body. The intellect is
        therefore also nobler than the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. According to the Philosopher, that which is proper to man as man is
        nobler than that which is shared by man and the other animals. But to
        understand is proper to man, whereas to will belongs to the other
        animals also. The Philosopher accordingly says, “Children and brutes
        share in what is voluntary.” The intellect is therefore nobler than the
        will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. The nearer a thing is to its end, the nobler it is, since the
        goodness of means is from the end. But the intellect seems to be nearer
        to the end than the will, for a man first attains the end by his
        intellect by knowing it before he does so by his will by desiring it.

        11. Gregory says, “The contemplative life is... of greater merit than

        1. The habit of a more perfect power is more perfect. But the habit by
        which the will is perfected, charity, is nobler than faith and
        knowledge, by which the intellect is perfected, as is evident from what
        the Apostle says in the first Epistle to the Corinthians (13: 2). The

        4. According to Dionysius the more common any one of the divine
        participations is, the nobler it is. But the will is more common than
        the intellect, because some things participate in will which do not
        participate in intellect, as was said above. The will is therefore

        love enters in where knowledge remains outside, for we love God more
        than we are able to know of Him. Therefore the will is nobler than the

        A thing can be said to be more eminent than another either simply or in
        a certain respect. For something to be shown to be simply better than
        another the comparison must be made on the basis of what is essential to
        them and not on that of accidentals. In the latter case one thing would
        be shown to stand out over another merely in a certain respect. Thus if
        a man were to be compared to a lion on the basis of essential
        differences, he would be found to be simply nobler inasmuch as the man
        is a rational animal, the lion irrational. But if a lion is compared to
        a man on the basis of physical strength, he surpasses the man. But this
        is to be nobler only in a certain respect. To see, then, which of these
        two powers, the will or the intellect, is better without qualification,
        we must consider the matter from their essential differences.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The perfection and dignity of the intellect consists in this, that the
        species of the thing which is understood is in the intellect itself,
        since in this way it actually understands, and from this its whole
        dignity is seen. The nobility of the will and of its act, however,
        consists in this, that the soul is directed to some noble thing in the
        very existence which that thing has in itself. Now it is more perfect,
        simply and absolutely speaking, to have within oneself the nobility of
        another thing than to be related to a noble thing outside oneself.
        Hence, if the will and the intellect are considered absolutely, and not
        with reference to this or that particular thing, they have this order,
        that the intellect is simply more excellent than the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But it may happen that to be related in some way to some noble thing is
        more excellent than to have its nobility within oneself. This is the
        case, for instance, when the nobility of that thing is possessed in a
        way much inferior to that in which the thing has it within itself. But
        if the nobility of one thing is in another just as nobly or more nobly
        than it is in the thing to which it belongs, then without doubt that
        which has the nobility of that thing within itself is nobler than that
        which is related in any way whatsoever to that noble thing. Now the
        intellect takes on the forms or things superior to the soul in a way
        inferior to that which they have in the things themselves; for the
        intellect receives things after its own fashion, as is said in
        <i>The Causes.</i> And for the same reason the forms of things inferior
        to the soul, such as corporeal things, are more noble in the soul than
        in the things themselves.

        The intellect can accordingly be compared to the will in three ways: (1)
        Absolutely and in general, without any reference to this or that
        particular thing. In this way the intellect is more excellent than the
        will, just as it is more perfect to possess what there is of dignity in
        a thing than merely to be related to its nobility. (2) With regard to
        material and sensible things. In this way again the intellect is simply
        nobler than the will. For example, to know a stone intellectually is
        nobler than to will it, because the form of the stone is in the
        intellect, inasmuch as it is known by the intellect, in a nobler way
        than it is in itself as desired by the will. (3) With reference to
        divine things, which are superior to the soul. In this way to will is
        more excellent than to understand, as to will God or to love Him is more
        excellent than to know Him. This is because the divine goodness itself
        is more perfectly in God Himself as He is desired by the will than the
        participated goodness is in us as known by the intellect.

        1. Augustine takes reason and intelligence for the whole intellective
        part, which includes both the apprehension of the intellect and the
        appetite of the will; and so the will is not excluded from the image.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The Master appropriates to reason the fact of being an image because
        it is prior; and to love, likeness, because with reference to God
        knowledge is completed by love, just as a picture is achieved and
        beautified by colors and similar means, by which it is made like the
        original.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That argument is based upon things surpassed in nobility by the soul.
        But by the same reasoning can be shown the pre-eminence of the will in
        reference to things nobler than the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The will has its object in common with the senses only in so far as
        it is directed to sensible things, which are inferior to the soul. But
        in so far as it is directed to intelligible and divine things, it is
        more distant from the senses than is the intellect, since the intellect
        can grasp less of divine things than the affective power desires and
        loves. The intellect rules the will, not by inclining it to that to
        which it tends, but by showing it that to which it should tend. When,
        therefore, the intellect is less capable of exhibiting something noble
        than the inclination of the will is of being directed to it, the will
        surpasses the intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The will does not proceed from intelligence directly but from the
        essence of the soul, intelligence being presupposed. From this, then,
        the order of dignity is not revealed, but only the order of origin, by
        which the intellect is naturally prior to the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The intellect abstracts from matter only when it knows sensible and
        material things; but when it knows things which are above it, it does
        not abstract; rather it receives things in a way that is less simple
        than the things are in themselves. Hence, the act of the will, which is
        directed to the things as they are in themselves, remains simpler and
        nobler.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Those expressions by which the intellect is compared to brightness
        and the will to warmth are metaphorical; and from such expressions no
        argument is to be drawn, as the Master says. Dionysius also says that
        symbolical theology is not argumentative.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Willing belongs to man alone as well as understanding, though tending
        appetitively belongs to other things besides man.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Although the soul is referred to God by the intellect before it is
        by the affections, nevertheless the affections attain Him more perfectly
        than does the intellect, as has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. The will is not excluded from contemplation. Gregory says that the
        contemplative life is to love God and one’s neighbor. Hence the
        pre-eminence of the contemplative life over the active is not
        prejudicial to the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. The Philosopher is Speaking of the intellect according as it is
        taken for the whole intellective part, which includes the will also. Or
        it can be said that he is viewing the intellect and the other powers of
        the soul absolutely, not as referred to this or that particular object.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The freedom of the will does not show that it is nobler simply, but
        that it is nobler in moving, as will appear more clearly from what
        follows.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Since the true is a certain good (for it is the good of the
        intellect, as is made clear by the Philosopher), good should not be
        called nobler than the true, just as animal is not nobler than man,
        since man includes the nobility of animal and adds to it. We are now
        speaking of the true and the good in so far as they are the objects of
        the will and of the intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Willing is not found more extensively than understanding although
        tending appetitively is. It should, however, be observed that in this
        argument the passage from Dionysius is not used in his meaning for two
        reasons. (1) Dionysius is speaking on the supposition that one is
        included in the notion of the other, as being in living and living in
        understanding. He accordingly says that one is simpler than the other.
        (2) Although a participation which is simpler is nobler, nevertheless,
        if it is taken together with the mode in which it is found. in things
        lacking additional perfections, it will be less noble. Thus if to be,
        which is nobler than to live, is taken together with the mode in which
        inanimate things are, that mode of being will be less noble than the
        being of living things, which is to live. It is accordingly not
        necessary that what is found more extensively should always be more
        noble; otherwise we should have to say that sense is nobler than
        intellect and the nutritive power nobler than the sensitive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. That argument is concerned with the will in reference to God. In this
        sense it is granted to be more noble.

        1. The mover is naturally prior to the thing moved. But the will is
        posterior to the intellect, for nothing is loved or desired unless it is
        known, according to Augustine. The will therefore does not move the
        intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. If the will moves the intellect to its act, then it follows that the
        intellect understands because the will wants it to understand. But the
        will does not want anything unless it is understood. The intellect
        therefore first understands its understanding before the will wills it.
        But before the intellect could understand this, the will would have to
        be held to will it, because the intellect is held to be moved by the
        will. We should then have to go on to infinity. But this is impossible.
        Therefore the will does not move the intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Every passive power is moved by its object. But the will is a passive
        power, for appetite is a mover which is moved, as is said in
        <i>The Soul</i>. Hence it is moved by its object. But its object is the
        understood or apprehended good, as is said in the same book. Therefore
        the intellect or some other apprehensive power moves the will, and not
        the other way about.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. One power is said to move another only because of the ability to
        command which it has over the other. But to command belongs to reason,
        as is said in the <i>Ethics</i>. It therefore belongs to reason to
        command the other powers and not to the will.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. According to Augustine, the mover and agent is nobler than the thing
        moved or made. But the intellect is nobler than the will, at least in
        regard to sensible things, as has been explained. At least in regard to
        these, then, it is not moved by the will.

        2. According to Augustine every motion proceeds from what is immovable.
        But among the powers of the soul the will is the only one which is
        immovable in the sense of not being able to be forced by anything. All
        the other powers of the soul are therefore moved by the will.

        In a way the intellect moves the will, and in a way the will moves the
        intellect and the other powers. For the clarification of this it should
        be noted that both an end and an efficient cause are said to move, but
        in different ways. Two things are to be taken into account in any
        action, the agent and the reason for acting. In heating, the agent is
        fire and the reason for acting is heat. Similarly in moving, the end is
        said to move as the reason for moving, but the efficient cause, as the
        one producing the movement, that is, the one which brings the subject of
        the motion from potency to act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The reason for acting is the form of the agent by which it acts. It must
        accordingly be in the agent for it to act. It is not there, however,
        according to its perfect act of being; for when that is had the motion
        comes to rest. But it is in the agent by way of an intention, for the
        end is prior in intention but posterior in being. Thus the end preexists
        in the mover in a proper sense intellectually (for it belongs to
        intellect to receive something by way of an intention) and not according
        to its real existence. Hence the intellect moves the will in the way in
        which an end is said to move—by conceiving beforehand the reason for
        acting and proposing it to the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To move in the manner of an efficient cause, however, belongs to the
        will and not to the intellect; for the will is referred to things as
        they are in themselves, whereas the intellect is referred to them as
        existing spiritually in the soul. Now to act and to move pertain to
        things according totheir own act of being by which they subsist in
        themselves, not according as they exist in the soul in the manner of an
        intention. It is not heat in the soul which heats, but that which is in
        fire. Thus the will is referred to things as subject to motion, but not
        the intellect. Furthermore the act of the will is an inclination to
        something, but not that of the intellect. But an inclination is the
        disposition of something that moves other things as an efficient cause
        moves. It is accordingly evident that the will has the function of
        moving in the manner of an agent cause; not, however, the intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The higher powers of the soul, because immaterial, are capable of
        reflecting upon themselves. Both the will and the intellect, therefore,
        reflect upon themselves, upon each other, upon the essence of the soul,
        and upon all its powers. The intellect understands itself and the will
        and the essence of the soul and all the soul’s powers. Similarly the
        will wills that it will, that the intellect understand, that the soul
        be, and so of the other powers. Now when one power is brought to bear
        upon another, it is referred to that other according to what is proper
        to itself. When the intellect understands that the will is willing, it
        receives within itself the intelligible character of willing. When the
        will is brought to bear upon the other powers of the soul, it is
        directed to them as things to which motion and operation belong, and it
        inclines each to its own operation. Thus the will moves in the manner of
        an efficient cause not only external things but also the very powers of
        the soul.

        originally prior then becomes posterior. And so, although the intellect
        is prior to the will when taken absolutely, it nonetheless becomes
        posterior to the will by reflection. Thus the will can move the
        intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. There is no necessity of going on to infinity, for we stop at the
        natural appetite by which the intellect is inclined to its act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The argument shows that the intellect moves in the manner of an end,
        for this is the bearing of the apprehended good upon the will.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4 Command belongs to both will and reason but in different respects. It
        belongs to the will in so far as a command implies an inclination; it
        belongs to reason in so far as this inclination is distributed and
        ordained to be carried out by this or that individual.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Any power surpasses another in what is proper to itself. Thus touch
        is referred to heat, which it senses in itself, in a more perfect way
        than sight, which sees it only by accident. Similarly the intellect is
        referred to truth more completely than the will; and conversely, the
        will is referred to the good in things more perfectly than the
        intellect. Hence, although the intellect is nobler than the will
        absolutely, at least in regard to some things, nevertheless under the
        aspect of moving, which belongs to the will by reason of the distinctive
        characteristic of its object, the will is found to be nobler.

        It seems that it is not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. In regard to the words of Luke (11: 34): “The light of thy body is
        thy eye,” the Gloss explains: “That is, ‘thy intention.” But the eye in
        the soul is reason or the intellect. Intention therefore pertains to
        reason or the intellect, not to the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The answer was given that it pertains to the will as subordinated to
        reason and in this respect is compared to an eye.—On the contrary, the
        act of a higher and prior power does not depend upon that of a posterior
        power. The will, however, is prior to the intellect in acting, because
        it moves the intellect; as has been said. Then the act of the will does
        not depend upon reason. If intention were an act of the will, it would
        therefore in no way pertain to reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The answer was given that the act of the will does depend upon reason
        in this respect, that knowledge of the thing willed is a prerequisite
        for willing; and so, although intention is an act of the will, it
        nevertheless does in some sense belong to reason.—On the contrary, there
        is no act of the will for which knowledge is not a prerequisite.
        Consequently, according to the proposed solution no act should be
        attributed to the will simply, not even willing and loving, but to will
        and reason together. This, however, is false. Then so is the preceding
        contention that intention is an act of the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The very name <i>intention</i> implies a relation to an end. But it
        belongs to reason to refer anything to an end. Intention therefore
        belongs to reason and not to will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. It was maintained in answer that there is in intention not only a
        relation to an end but also an act of the will which is referred to the
        end, and that both are meant by the name intention.—On the contrary,
        that act is made the substratum of the relation to an end as a material
        principle is made that of the formal. But a thing takes its name from
        its formal rather than its material principle. Intention accordingly
        takes its name rather from what belongs to reason than from what belongs
        to will, and so it should be held to be an act of reason rather than of
        will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Reason directs the will just as the prime mover directs the whole of
        nature. But the intention in the things of nature is more properly
        attributed to the prime mover than to the things of nature themselves,
        since these are said to intend something only in so far as they are
        directed by the prime mover. Then among the powers of the soul too,
        intention should be attributed to reason rather than to the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Properly speaking there is an intention only in a knower. But the
        will is not a knower. Intention therefore does not belong to the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. There cannot be a single act of things that are in no sense one. But
        the will and reason are in no sense one, since they even belong to
        different genera of powers of the soul: the will is in the appetitive
        genus and reason is in the intellective. Consequently reason and the
        will cannot have a single act; and so, if intention is in any sense an
        act of reason, it will not be an act of the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. According to the Philosopher “willing has as its object only the
        end.” But in a single order there is only a single end. The will in its
        act, then, is referred to only one thing. But where there is only one
        thing, there is no order. Since intention implies order, it therefore
        seems that it in no sense belongs to the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Intention seems to be nothing but the direction of the will to the
        last end. But it belongs to reason to direct the will. Intention
        therefore belongs to reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. In the perversity of sin error belongs to reason, contempt to the
        irascible power, and the inordinacy of will to the concupiscible. In the
        reformation of the soul, on the other hand, faith belongs to reason,
        hope to the irascible power, and charity to the concupiscible. But
        according to Augustine, it is faith which “directs the intention.”
        Intention therefore belongs to reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. According to the Philosopher, the will is referred to both possibles
        and impossibles, but intention only to possibles. Intention does not,
        then, belong to the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13 What is not in the soul is not in the will. Now intention is not in
        the soul, because it is not a power (for then it would be natural, and
        there would be no merit in it), nor is it a habit (for then it would be
        in one asleep), nor is it a passion (for then it would pertain to the
        sensitive part, as is apparent from what the Philosopher says). Since
        there are in the soul only these three, as is said in the <i>Ethics</i>,
        intention is not in the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. To order is the function of reason, since this belongs to the wise
        man, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i>. But intention is an
        ordination to an end. It therefore is the function of reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. Intention is referred to what is distant from an end, since distance
        is implied in the [Latin] preposition in [here used as a prefix]. But
        reason is more distant from the end than is the will, because reason
        merely points out the end, whereas the will clings to the end as its
        proper object. Intending, then, belongs to reason rather than to the
        will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. Every act of the will belongs to it either absolutely, or by a
        reference to higher powers, or by a reference to lower powers. Now
        intending is not an act of the will absolutely, because in that case it
        would be the same as willing or loving. Nor is intending its act by a
        reference to a higher power, reason, for in that reference its act is to
        choose. Nor is it so by a reference to lower powers, since its act in
        that reference is to command. Intending is therefore in no wise an act
        of the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Intention is referred only to the end. But the end and good are the
        object of the will. Intention therefore pertains to the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Intending is a sort of pursuing. But pursuit and flight pertain to
        the will, not to reason. To reason it belongs only to say that something
        should be pursued or fled. Intention accordingly belongs to the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. All merit is situated in the will. But intention is meritorious, and
        chiefly on the basis of it merit and demerit are reckoned. Hence
        intention is a function of the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Ambrose says: “Affection gives the name to your work.” But an act is
        judged to be good or bad from the intention. The intention is therefore
        contained in affection, and so it seems to belong to the will and not to
        reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Intention is an act of the will. This shows up very clearly from its
        object. A power and its act must agree in their object, since a power is
        referred to the object only through the act. Thus for the power of sight
        and for vision there must be the same object, color. Now since the
        object of the act of intention is the good which is an end, and this is
        also the object of the will, intention must be an act of the will. It
        is, however, an act of the will, not absolutely, but in subordination to
        reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        That this may be seen clearly it should be noted that, whenever there
        are two agents standing in an order, the second agent can move or act in
        two ways: (1) according to what belongs to its own nature, and (2)
        according to what belongs to the nature of the higher agent. The
        influence of the higher agent remains in the lower, and for this reason
        the lower acts not only by its own action but also by the action of the
        higher. The sphere of the sun, for example, moves by its own motion,
        which is completed in the course of a year, and by the motion of the
        first mobile, which is the motion of one day. In like fashion water
        moves by its own motion, tending to the center, and it has a motion from
        the influence of the moon moving it, as is revealed in the tides.
        Compounds also have certain reactions proper to themselves which are
        based upon the natures of the four elements, such as to tend downward,
        to heat, and to cool; and they have other operations from the influence
        of the heavenly bodies, as a magnet attracts iron.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Though no action of the lower agent takes place unless that of the
        higher agent is presupposed, nevertheless the action which belongs to it
        in accordance with its own nature is attributed to it absolutely, as it
        is attributed to water to move downward; but that which belongs to it
        from the influence of the higher agent is not attributed to it
        absolutely but only with reference to something else. Thus the ebb and
        flow of the tides are said to be the proper motion of the sea, not in so
        far as it is water, but in so far as it is moved by the moon.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now reason and the will are operative powers related to each other.
        Viewed absolutely, reason is prior, although by reflection the will is
        made prior and superior inasmuch as it moves reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The will can accordingly have two types of acts. (1) It has one which
        belongs to it according to its own nature inasmuch as it tends to its
        own object absolutely. This act is attributed to the will without
        qualification, e.g:, to will and to love, although even for this act the
        action of reason is presupposed. (2) It has another type of act which
        belongs to it inasmuch as the influence of reason is left in the will.
        Since the proper function of reason is to order and compare, whenever
        there appears in the act of the will any comparison or ordering, such an
        act does not belong to the will absolutely but in subordination to
        reason. It is in this way that intending is an act of the will, since to
        intend seems to be nothing but to tend from what one wills to something
        else as to an end. Thus intending differs from willing in this, that
        willing tends.to an end absolutely whereas intending expresses a
        reference to an end inasmuch as the end is that to which the means are
        referred. Since the will is moved to its object as proposed to it by
        reason, it is moved in various ways according as the object is variously
        proposed. When reason proposes something to it as a good absolutely, the
        will is moved to it absolutely. This is willing. When reason proposes
        something to it under the aspect of a good to which other things are
        referred as to an end, then the will tends to it with a certain order,
        which is found in the act of the will, not in accordance with its own
        nature, but in accordance with the demands of reason. In this way
        intending is an act of the will in subordination to reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Intention is likened to an eye as regards the characteristic of
        reason which is found in it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Reason moves the will in a certain sense, and the will in a certain
        sense moves reason, as is evident from what has been said. Thus each one
        is higher than the other in a different respect, and to each can be
        attributed an act in subordination to the other.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although any act of the will presupposes knowledge on the part of
        reason, nevertheless there does not always appear in the act of the will
        what is proper to reason, as is clear from what has been said. Hence the
        argument proves nothing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. An active relation to the end belongs to reason, for it is its
        function to refer or relate to an end. But a passive relation can belong
        to whatever is directed or referred to an end by reason, and so it can
        also belong to the will. It is in this sense that the relation to an end
        pertains to intention.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. From what has just been said the answer is clear.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. In the prime mover there is found not only knowledge but also will,
        and so intention can properly be attributed to it. But only knowledge
        belongs to reason. The case is accordingly not the same.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7.Intending also has to do with non-cognitive beings, since even the
        things of nature intend an end, even though intention supposes some
        knowledge. But if we speak of an intention of the soul, this has to do
        only with cognitive beings, as does willing. Yet it is not necessary
        that intending and willing be acts of the same power as knowing, but
        merely of the same supposite. Properly speaking, it is not a power which
        knows or intends, but the supposite through a power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Reason and the will are one by order, just as the universe is said to
        be one. In this case nothing prevents a single act from belonging to
        both, to one immediately, to the other mediately.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Although the will is chiefly concerned with the end in view of the
        fact that the means are desired only for the sake of the end,
        nevertheless the will is also concerned with the means to the end. The
        statement of the Philosopher that “the will is concerned with the end;
        choice, with the means,”“ does not mean that the will is always directed
        to the end, but merely sometimes and chiefly. From the fact that choice
        is never directed to the end it is shown that choosing and willing are
        not the same thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Active direction to an end belongs to reason, but passive direction
        to an end can belong to will. In the latter way it belongs to intcntion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Faith directs our intention as reason directs our will. Intention
        accordingly is a function of the will as faith is of reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. The will is not always concerned with impossibles but merely
        sometimes. In conformity with the Philosopher’s meaning this suffices to
        show the difference between willing and choice, which is always
        concerned with possibles; that is, it shows that to choose is not
        altogether the same as to will. Similarly, neither is to intend
        altogether the same as to will. But this does not keep it from being an
        act of the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. Intention is an act of the soul. But in that threefold division
        proposed by the Philosopher the actions of the soul are not included,
        because actions do not belong to the soul as being <i>in</i> the soul
        but rather as being <i>from</i> the soul.—Or it may be said that actions
        are included under habits as that which proceeds from a principle is
        contained within its principle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. To order is the function of reason, but to be ordered can be the
        function of the will. In this way intention implies ordering.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. That argument would prove something if nothing else were required
        for intention besides mere distance. But along with distance there is
        required an inclination; and that inclination is in the province of the
        will, not of reason. Hence the conclusion does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        16. Intention is an act of the will in subordination to reason as it
        directs to an end the means to it. Choice is an act of the will in
        subordination to reason as it compares among themselves the means to an
        end. On this account intention and choice also differ.

        1. It is impossible for the same act to be at the same time good and
        bad. But it sometimes happens that there is a bad act of will with a
        good intention, as when someone wishes to steal in order to give an
        alms. Intending and willing are therefore not the same act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. According to the Philosopher, a motion which terminates in the mean
        and one which terminates in the extreme are specifically different. But
        the means to an end and the end are related about as the mean and the
        extreme. The intention of the end and the willing of the means are
        therefore specifically different, and so they are not a single act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. According to the Philosopher,in practical matters ends are comparable
        to principles in demonstrative sciences. But the act of the speculative
        intellect by which it understands principles is not the same as that by
        which it sees conclusions. This is shown by the fact that they are
        elicited from different habits; for understanding is the habit of
        principles, and science, that of conclusions. Then in matters of
        operation it is not the same act of the will by which we intend the end
        and will the means.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Acts are distinguished by their objects. But the end and the means
        are distinct. The intention of the end and the willing of the means are
        therefore not the same act.

        1. There cannot be two acts of the same power at the same time. But
        while the will is willing the means, it is at the same time intending
        the end. The intention of the end and the willing of the means are
        therefore not distinct acts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The end is the reason for the appetibility of the means just as light
        is the reason for the visibility of color. But in the same act sight
        sees color and light. In the same act, therefore, the will wills the
        means and intends the end.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Concerning this question there are two opinions, as the Master of the
        <i>Sentences</i> says. Some have said that the willing of the means to
        an end and the intention of the end are distinct acts. Others, on the
        contrary, have said that they are one and the same act but that their
        distinction comes merely from the difference in things. Each of these
        opinions is in some respect true.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In clarification of this it should be noted that, since the unity of an
        act is to be judged from the unity of its object, if there are any two
        things which are one in any sense, an act which is directed to them
        under the aspect of their unity will be one. But an act which is
        directed to them under the aspect of their duality will be two different
        acts. Take for example the parts of a line, which are in some sense two
        and in some sense one—as they are united in the whole. If an act of
        vision is directed to the two parts of the line as two, that is, to each
        one under the aspect of what is proper to it, there will be two acts Of
        seeing, and the two parts will not be able to be seen at the same time.
        But if our vision is directed to the whole line embracing both parts, it
        will be a single act of seeing, and the whole line will be seen at once.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now all things that are arranged in an order are, indeed, many in so far
        as they are things viewed in themselves, but they are one in regard to
        the order in which they are arranged. An act of the soul which is
        directed to them from the point of view of their order is accordingly
        one. But an act which is directed to them as considered in themselves is
        manifold. This distinction shows up in a viewing of the statue of
        Mercury. If one looks upon it as a thing in itself, one’s attention will
        in one act be directed to it, and in another to Mercury, whose image the
        statue is. But if one looks upon the statue as the image of Mercury, in
        the same act one’s attention will be directed to the statue and to
        Mercury.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Similarly when the motion of the will is directed to the end and to the
        means, if it is directed to them inasmuch as each is a certain thing
        existing by itself, there will be a distinct motion of the will for
        each. In this way the opinion which says that the intention of the end
        and the willing of the means are distinct acts is true. But if the will
        is directed to one as having an ordination to the other, there is a
        single act of the will in regard to both. In this way the other opinion’
        which holds that the intention of the end and the willing of the means
        are one and the same act, is true.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now if the essential character of intention is rightly examined, the
        latter opinion is found to be truer than the former. For the motion of
        the will toward an end taken absolutely is not called an intention, but
        it is called willing without further qualification. But an inclination
        of the will to an end as being that in which the means terminate is
        called an intention. A person who wants health is said simply to will
        it. He is said to intend it only when he wills something else on account
        of health. And so it must be granted that intention is not an act
        numerically distinct from willing.

        1. A single act cannot be both good and bad; yet there can bbee aa good
        circumstance of a bad act. The act is vicious if a person eats more than
        he should, though he may eat when he should. Thus the act of will by
        which someone wishes to steal in order to give food to a poor man is an
        act simply evil, yet having a good circumstance; for the reason for
        which something is done is listed as one of the circumstances.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The Philosopher’s statement is to be understood as meaning: when the
        motion stops in the mean. When it passes through the mean to the term,
        then the motion is numerically one. And so when the will is moved to a
        means subordinated to the end, there is a single motion.

        3 When the conclusion and the principle are considered each by itself,
        there are distinct considerations; but when the principle is considered
        in its relation to the conclusion, as happens in syllogizing, there is
        one and the same consideration of both.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The end and the means are one object in so far as one is considered
        in relation to the other.

        1. Ignorance is not found in the will but in reason. But the perversity
        of a choice is a sort of ignorance. Hence also “every evil person is
        said to be ignorant” with the ignorance of choice, as is explained in
        the <i>Ethics.</i> Choice, then, pertains to reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Not only do inquiry and argumentation belong to reason but also
        conclusion. But a choice is, as it were, the conclusion of a
        deliberation, as is made clear in the <i>Ethics.</i> Since deliberation
        belongs to reason, choice will therefore also belong to reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. According to the Philosopher3 the chief characteristic of moral
        virtue consists in choice. But, as he himself says, in the moral virtues
        the part of prudence is the most important factor, adding the last
        formal determinant to the essential nature of virtue. Choice therefore
        pertains to prudence. But prudence is in reason, and so choice also is.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Choice implies a certain discrimination. But to discriminate is a
        function of reason. Therefore to choose also is.

        1. To choose is, when two things are proposed, to want one in preference
        to the other, as Damascene explains.But to want is an act of the will,
        not of reason. Then so is to choose.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The Philosopher says that choice is the desire of what has been
        previously deliberated. But desire is a function of the will, not of
        reason. Then so is choice.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Choice contains something of the will and something of reason. But the
        Philosopher seems to leave in doubt whether it is properly an act of the
        will or of reason, when he says that choice is an act either of the
        intellective appetite (that is, of appetite as subordinated to the
        intellect) or of the appetitive intellect (that is, of the intellect in
        subordination to appetite). The first, that it is an act of the will in
        subordination to reason, is the truer.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        That it is directly an act of the will is clear from two considerations:
        (1) From the formality of its object. The proper object of choice is the
        means to an end, and this belongs to the formality of good, which is the
        object of the will. For both the end, such as the honorable or the
        pleasurable, and the means, namely, the useful, are called good. (2)
        From the formality of the act itself. Choice is the final acceptance of
        something to be carried out. This is not the business of reason but of
        will; for, however much reason puts one ahead of the other, there is not
        yet the acceptance of one in preference to the other as something to be
        done until the will inclines to the one rather than to the other. The
        will does not of necessity follow reason. Choice is nevertheless not an
        act of the will taken absolutely but in its relation to reason, because
        there appears in choice what is proper to reason: the comparing of one
        with the other or the putting of one before the other. This is, of
        course, found in the act of the will from the influence of reason:
        reason proposes something to the will, not as useful simply, but as the
        more useful to an end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is accordingly clear that the act of the will is to will, to choose,
        and to intend. It is to will in so far as reason proposes to the will
        something good absolutely, whether it is something to be chosen for
        itself, as an end, or because of something else, as a means. In either
        case we are said to will it. In so far as reason proposes to the will a
        good as the more useful to an end, the act is to choose. It is to intend
        in so far as reason proposes to the will a good as an end to be attained
        through a means.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Ignorance is attributed to choice on the basis of the part played in
        it by reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The conclusion of a practical inquiry is of two kinds. One is in
        reason, and this is decision, the judgment about what has been
        deliberated upon. The other is in the will, and this is choice. It is
        called a conclusion by a sort of simile, because in speculative matters
        the discourse finally comes to rest in the conclusion, and in matters of
        operation it comes to rest in the doing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Choice is said to be the principal element in moral virtue both from
        the point of view of the role of reason in it, and from that of the role
        of the will. Both are necessary for the essential character of moral
        virtue. Choice is called the principal element with reference to
        external acts. It is accordingly not necessary that choice be entirely
        an act of prudence, but it shares in the characteristics of prudence as
        it does in those of reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Discrimination is found in choice in accordance with what belongs to
        reason, whose distinctive characteristic the will follows in choosing,
        as has been said.
