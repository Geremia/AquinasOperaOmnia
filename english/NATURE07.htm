    <p>
      After treating what pertains intrinsically to motion, the Philosopher now
      turns to what is extrinsically connected with mobile things. The first is
      place, which is the measure of mobile things {connected with place is
      concept of space or void} and then time, which is the measure of motion
      itself.
    </p>
    <p><strong>7.1 PLACE</strong> (Book 4, Lesson 1)</p>
    <p><strong>7.1.1 Why consider it?</strong></p>
    <p>
      The most basic and obvious of the forms of motion is local motion. This
      kind of motion cannot be understood without understanding place. Besides
      there have been some misunderstandings and controversies about the notion
      of place, which should be settled.
    </p>
    <p><strong>7.1.2 Reasons supporting the existence of place</strong></p>
    <p>
      1) The fact of place is clear from the fact of local motion. For just as
      the existence of matter came to be known from change according to form, so
      the existence of place is known from change according to place. Thus, when
      water is poured out of a vessel, air re-enters. Since, therefore, another
      body sometimes occupies the same place, it is clear that place is
      something different form the things that are in place and which are moved
      according to place. Consequently, place is something: it is a sort of
      receptacle distinct from any of the things located in it, and it is the
      term "from which" and "to which" of local motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) The existence of place is also evidenced by the fact of "proper place",
      i.e. that heavy bodies are carried down and light ones upward; everything
      gravitates to its own place by a desire of self-preservation. This,
      however, does not prove that place has the power to attract, except in the
      sense in which the end is said to attract. Gravitation is also the basis
      for the concepts of "up" and "down". Other directions, such as "right" and
      "left", "before" and behind, are based on the position men or animals may
      be facing. If we were to speak purely mathematically and abstract from
      gravitation or the position of animals, there would be no basis for saying
      anything is in a certain direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      3) Even those who assert that the void or space exists must admit that
      place exists, since the void is nothing more than a place devoid of any
      body. Likewise the poet Hesiod speculated that the first thing made was
      chaos, then the earth as a receptacle for bodies. He thought that place
      can exist without other bodies, but other bodies cannot exist without
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7.1.3 Reasons challenging the existence of place</strong> (Book 4,
      Lesson 2)
    </p>
    <p>
      1) If place is anything it must be a body, since place has three
      dimensions. But if a body is in a place, then two bodies must be together,
      which is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) The surface of a body should be distinct from the surface of the place
      which is its receptacle. But two surfaces must be one surface, just like
      two points which touch; for two points joined together are just one point.
      Therefore the place of the body will not be different from the body
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      3) If place is not a body, then it cannot have magnitude and cannot exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      4) Everything that exists is somehow a cause in relation to other things.
      But place is not a cause: neither as <em>matter</em>, since nothing is
      made out of it, nor as <em>form</em>, since things of different species
      are in the same place, nor as the <em>final</em> cause, since places seem
      to be for the sake of the things in place rather than they for the sake of
      the places, nor as <em>efficient</em> cause, since place is the terminus
      of a motion. Therefore place seems to be nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      5) Zeno's reason: Whatever exists is in place; hence if place is anything
      it follows that it is itself in place, and that place in another place and
      so on <em>ad infinitum</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      6) Place is neither smaller nor larger than the thing in place. But when a
      thing in place grows, its place also should grow. However, this seems
      impossible, for place is an immobile something. Therefore place is not
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7.1.4 Reasons supporting that place is form or matter</strong>
      (Book 4, Lesson 3)
    </p>
    <p>
      First, distinguish between <strong>common</strong> place and
      <strong>proximate</strong> place. It is true to say that I am in the
      world, but proximately I am on this chair in this room. Since place, then,
      seems to be the immediate boundary of a thing, it resembles form, since
      form limits matter to its own existence and magnitude to a determinate
      measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, place seems to resemble matter. That is because it
      seems to be nothing other than the space enveloped by the boundaries of a
      container, which has length, breadth and depth. This space does not seem
      to be the same as any sensible body, because the space remains the same
      even when various bodies successively enter and leave it. Thus it follows
      that place is a set of dimensions separate from bodies. Therefore Plato
      argued that place is matter, since place is different from a body with
      definite dimensions and a numerical identity (since Plato made numbers and
      quantity the substance of things). Whether Plato held that place is
      exactly matter or else "the large and the small", it is clear that he
      defined place as some kind of receptacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      If place is either form or matter, it will be difficult to define, since
      both form and matter are difficult notions and one cannot be know without
      the other.
    </p>
    <p><strong>7.1.5 Reasons why place should not be form or matter</strong></p>
    <p>
      1) Form and matter are not separate from the thing of which they are
      components, whereas place is distinct --in the place where air was, water
      now is. Likewise place is not an accident of a thing, since an accident
      cannot be separated from the thing. Nor can place be said to be matter,
      because matter does not contain but is contained by form.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) Even if something never moves from its place, the very fact that we say
      it is <strong>in</strong> place shows that place is distinct from the
      thing and its form or matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      3) Matter and form are part of the thing moved from one place to another.
      If matter or form were place, then place would move and be in place, which
      is nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      4) In corruption the matter and the form are accidentally corrupted. But
      no explanation can be given of how place is corrupted; hence it cannot be
      said that matter or form are place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7.1.6 Distinctions necessary for a definition of place</strong>
      (Book 4, Lesson 4)
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight ways in which something is said to be <strong>in</strong> something:
    </p>
    <p>
      1) The way a finger is said to be in the hand and in general any part is
      in its whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) The way the whole is said to be in its parts. Since this way of
      speaking is not so common, we must understand that the whole is not
      something outside its parts, but exists in them.
    </p>
    <p>3) The way "man" is in "animal", and any species in its genus.</p>
    <p>
      4) The way a genus is in its species, such as "animal" in "man". That is
      because the genus is part of the definition of the species; so both the
      genus and the specific difference are parts of a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      5) The way health is in a balance of temperature, and any form is in
      matter or a subject, whether the form be accidental or substantial.
    </p>
    <p>
      6) The way Nigeria is in the hands of the head of state, and anything
      moved in its mover. Thus we say "It is in me to do such and such", because
      it is in my power.
    </p>
    <p>
      7) The way someone's heart is in what he desires and loves, and anything
      in its final cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      8) The way something is in a vessel, and in general as a thing is in its
      place. The same could be said of being in a certain time, for time is the
      measure of motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all these ways, the last is the most proper sense something is said to
      be <strong>in</strong> something. A thing in place is contained or
      included by its place and has rest and immobility therein. The nearest to
      this way is (1) the way a part is contained in an integral whole, as in a
      conjoined place. Then comes (4) the way a whole is contained in the
      definition of something, as "animal" in "man". Then (3) there is the way a
      species in a genus, which contains it an other species as well. Similarly
      to this is (5) the way form is contained in the potency of matter.
      Likewise (2) the whole resembles a form in being in its parts. And the way
      form is enclosed under the passive potency of matter, so (6) the effect is
      enclosed under the active potency of the agent. Finally (7) it is clear
      that the appetite rests in the good it desires and loves and is, indeed,
      fixed in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7.1.7 Other suppositions toward a definition of place</strong>
      (Book 4, Lesson 5)
    </p>
    <p>So much is clear about place:</p>
    <p>
      1) That place contains what is in place while remaining distinct from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) Primary [= proximate] place is equal to, and neither greater nor less
      than the thing in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      3) Everything in place has a place, although it can move from that place
      to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      4) Every body has a gravitational attraction, which accounts for the
      directions of up and down; its density determines its natural level with
      reference to neighbouring bodies (e.g. water, oil, air).
    </p>
    <p>
      A good definition of place should: 1) show what place is, 2) resolve
      conflicting arguments about place, 3) reveal the characteristics of place,
      since a definition is used as a middle term to demonstrate its proper
      accidents, 4) point out the reason why conflicting things were said about
      it. Such a procedure is the best way of defining anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of place would never have arisen were there no motion from
      one place to another. This takes place directly in local motion, and
      indirectly in growth, whereby a body acquires a larger place.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must distinguish between <strong>per se</strong> and
      <strong>accidental</strong> motion. The latter occurs when, for example,
      we are sitting still in a moving car. The car is moving
      <strong>per se</strong>, and we are moving accidentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must also distinguish between <strong>primary</strong> place, which is
      our immediate surroundings, and <strong>common</strong> place which is the
      larger area where we happen to be (e.g. town, country, continent).
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever the container is not separate from the thing contained but is
      continuous with it, the thing contained cannot be said to be in it as in a
      place, but as a part in a whole, for example my hand in my body, and it
      changes place along with the body. But if the container is separate and
      contiguous to the thing contained it is equal to it in dimension.
    </p>
    <p><strong>7.1.9 The definition of place</strong> (Book 4, Lesson 6)</p>
    <p>
      First of all, place cannot be form, since it is extrinsic to what it
      contains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, place is not the same as space, although it might seem to be,
      since space is thought of as absolute dimensions that do not change,
      whatever bodies happen to fill it. There cannot be any spatial dimensions
      apart from bodies and other environing or containing bodies, because if
      space were something with its own dimensions independent of bodies, then
      there would be two sets of dimensions that interpenetrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, place is not matter, although place receives the different things
      it contains in a way resembling the way matter receives different forms.
      Yet matter becomes one thing with the form it receives, whereas place
      remains distinct from what is in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, place must be
      <strong>the boundary of the containing body</strong>, while the contained
      body is what is apt to be moved in respect to place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Place is also in some way <strong>immobile</strong>. That is how a place
      differs from a <strong>vessel</strong>, because a vessel can be moved, but
      a place cannot. If I am riding in a car, I am not
      <strong>per se</strong> in motion, but the car is. I am at rest
      <strong>per se</strong>, but <strong>per accidens</strong> I am in motion.
      Therefore I am not staying in the same place. My place is determined not
      by the vessel which immediately contains me, but by reference to the place
      that contains the vessel. Thus a boat could be <strong>per se</strong> in
      motion going upstream on water that is <strong>per se</strong> in motion
      going downstream (a vessel in a vessel), both at equal speeds so that the
      boat remains in one place, with reference to the shore of the river.
      Likewise, the wind blowing on my face is not place, but only in so far as
      it is in position to the immobile surface I am standing on.
    </p>
    <p>
      What gives stability to place? Natural place and rest is determined by
      gravitational force. Abstracting from gravitation, it would make just as
      much sense to say that a car is moving down the express way as to say that
      the express way (and surrounding world) is in motion and the car is
      standing still. On this planet gravitation determines whether we are going
      to the U.S. or the U.S. is coming to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it is true [as Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas did not know] that the
      earth itself is a vessel carrying us around the sun, and the sun is
      carrying all its planets somewhere else, so that we cannot determine any
      fixed point of immobility in the universe --although, apart from
      gravitation, it would make equal sense to say that the earth revolves
      around the sun or the sun around the earth. Yet it is sufficient for
      distinguishing what is in motion from what is at rest to determine
      <strong>relatively immobile</strong> reference points determined by
      natural gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Aristotle concludes that <em>place</em> is
      <strong
        >the immobile surface of that which primarily contains a body</strong
      >. The word "primarily" designates proper place (the nearest immobile
      surface, if in a vessel) and exclude common place.
    </p>
    <p><strong>7.1.10 Explanations</strong> (Book 4, Lesson 7)</p>
    <p>
      The universe as a whole is not in a place, since there is no outer
      containing body. Because Aristotle imagined the heavens to be concentric
      spheres around the earth, he inquires how a sphere moves. We could ask the
      same question about a ball spinning on a table. The ball is not changing
      place, and in this sense it is not in motion, but it is in motion by
      reason of its parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Book 4, Lesson 8] As for some of the problems raised in Lesson 2, they
      are all solved by the definition of place as the surface of a containing
      body:
    </p>
    <p>
      (6) that place should grow as a body grows. <b>Reply:</b> This would be so
      if place were a space co-extensive with the dimensions of the body, but if
      it is the boundary of the container, the growing body merely takes up more
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) that two touching surfaces are one. <b>Reply:</b> This again is a
      confusion of place with "space" that has dimensions corresponding with the
      surface of the body. This, however, need not be said if we suppose that
      place is the boundary of the container.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) that place is a body, and so it and the located body are two bodies in
      the same place. <b>Reply:</b> This is a wrong supposition, since place is
      the surface of a containing body.
    </p>
    <p>
      (5) that place is in a place <em>ad infinitum</em>, <b>Reply:</b> Rather,
      place is in a body not as in a place, but as a surface in a body.
    </p>
    <p><strong>7.1.11 Gravity</strong></p>
    <p>
      Bodies naturally gravitate to other bodies of greater density. We see it
      in drops of water or mercury coalescing on a table. We see all things
      about us gravitating to the earth. We observe through tides how the waters
      of the oceans gravitate towards the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas were wrong in thinking that the more noble
      things (like fire) go up and earth goes down, and in their idea that the
      sun, moon and other heavenly bodies were incorruptible. Nevertheless they
      were fundamentally right in seeing gravity as a spontaneous inclination of
      bodies to be together for the purpose of survival. This idea, however, is
      inconsistent with another of their erroneous positions, namely, that the
      sphere of the stars is the first place and containing body of the rest of
      the lower universe. This is wrong, because we do not look up for a focus
      of natural place, but down to the earth, or to any other centre of gravity
      in the universe.<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>7.2 THE VOID</strong></p>
    <p><strong>7.2.1 Arguments for its existence</strong> (Book 4, Lesson 9)</p>
    <p>
      Change of place would be impossible if there were no void. That is because
      something cannot be moved into what is full, because a place filled with
      one body cannot receive another. Otherwise there would be two bodies in
      the same place. But there is motion. Therefore, there is a void.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, bodies that can be compressed or condensed seem to do so because
      the parts are pressed into empty spaces, like foam. Likewise, a body
      cannot absorb food and grow unless there is empty space into which the
      food can be taken. Besides, you can pour as much water into a bowl of gari
      as you can into an empty bowl; that shows that there are empty spaces in
      the gari.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pythagoreans not only posited an infinite void outside the universe,
      but also attributed the distinction of things in the universe to a void;
      according to them, numbers are the natures of things, and are distinct
      from one another by a void. This is using "void" in a quasi-equivocal
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >7.2.2 The meaning of void & refutation of arguments for its
        existence</strong
      >
      (Book 4, Lesson 10)
    </p>
    <p>
      According to common opinion, the void seems to signify nothing more than a
      place in which there is nothing. It is thought to be necessary to allow
      for the possibility of motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet besides local motion there is also alteration, which would not require
      a void.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even local motion does not require a void if we suppose that bodies can
      contract so as to give way; this is especially evident when things pass
      through water or air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, compression does not necessarily presuppose a void, but a porous
      material containing air, as in the case of gari, where the water poured in
      replaces the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise food taken into a body does not require a void in the body, but
      it is altered and is converted into the substance of the body; this is not
      just a case of filling the stomach, but of the whole body growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7.2.3 Arguments from motion against a separated void</strong>
      (Book 4, Lesson 11)
    </p>
    <p>
      1) The void is not a cause of motion, because bodies do not move because
      they are sucked into a vacuum, but because they naturally gravitate to
      their natural level.
    </p>
    <p>
      2) The void, if taken as empty space, is something negative and can have
      no finality about it so as to be a destination of gravitation, unlike
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      3) Rather than being a requirement for motion, the void would actually
      make it impossible, since in a void there is nowhere to go; so a body
      would just rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      4) Similarly, in a void we cannot speak of directions; therefore motion
      would be impossible, since it is always in some direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >7.2.4 Arguments from the nature of a void against a separated
        void</strong
      >
      (Book 4, Lesson 13)
    </p>
    <p>
      To say that a body moves in a void presupposes that the void is
      measurable, which means that it has dimensions. In that case the
      dimensions of the moving body and the dimensions of the void would
      co-exist, and be the same as two bodies in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, there is no experimental evidence of a void; whatever might seem
      to be a void is just thin air.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7.2.5 Arguments against a void within bodies</strong> (Book 4,
      Lesson 14)
    </p>
    <p>
      Some philosophers posited a void within bodies to allow for their
      contraction, so as to permit motion. That is because if there is no empty
      space in bodies, either there would be a total jam, with no body yielding
      to another, or anything moving in a straight direction would push
      everything in its path all the way to the edge of the universe, thus
      disturbing the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same arguments that were used against a separated void apply to a void
      within bodies, but the phenomenon of expansion and contraction of bodies
      can be explained otherwise than by a void. Just as something can change
      from cold to hot, so its volume can alter because of the potency of the
      matter to different sizes, not by an addition of more matter. Things in a
      state of compression are heavier and harder than equal volumes of the same
      thing rarefied or expanded. Thus there is no need to posit a void in
      bodies to allow for motion.<br wp="BR1" />

      Hitherto I have laid down the definitions of such words as are less known,
      and explained the sense in which I would have them to be understood in the
      following discourse. I do not define time, space, place and motion as
      being well known to all. Only I must observe that the vulgar conceive
      those quantities under no other notions but form the relations they bear
      to sensible objects. And thence arise certain prejudices, for the removing
      of which it will be convenient to distinguish them into absolute and
      relative, true and apparent, mathematical and common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature
      flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is
      called duration: relative, apparent and common time is some sensible and
      external (whether accurate or inequable) measure of duration by the means
      of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time, such as an hour, a
      day, a month, a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external,
      remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some movable
      dimension or measure of the absolute spaces, which our senses determine by
      its position to bodies, and which is vulgarly taken for immovable space;
      such is the dimension of a subterraneous, an aerial or celestial space,
      determined by its position in respect of the earth. absolute and relative
      space are the same in figure and magnitude, but they do not remain always
      numerically the same. For if the earth, for instance, moves, a space of
      our air, which relatively and in respect of the earth remains always the
      same, will at one time be one part of the absolute space into which the
      air passes; at another time it will be another part of the same, and so,
      absolutely understood, it will be perpetually mutable.
    </p>

      Place is a part of space which a body takes up, and is, according to the
      space, either absolute or relative. I say, a part of space, not the
      situation, nor the external surface of the body. For the places of equal
      solids are always equal, but their superficies, by reason of their
      dissimilar figures, are often unequal. Positions properly have no
      quantity, nor are they so much the places themselves, as the properties of
      places. The motion of the whole is the same thing with the sum of the
      motions of the parts; that is, the translation of the whole out of its
      place is the same thing with the sum of the translations of the parts out
      of their places, and therefore the place of the whole is the same thing
      with the sum of the places of the parts, and for that reason it is
      internal and in the whole body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute place into
      another, and relative motion the translation from one relative place into
      another. Thus in a ship under sail, the relative place of a body is that
      part of the ship which the body possesses, or that part of its cavity
      which the body fills and which therefore moves together with the ship: and
      relative rest is the continuance of the body in the same part of the ship
      or of its cavity. But real, absolute rest is the continuance of the body
      in the same part of that immovable space in which the ship itself, its
      cavity and all that it contains is moved. Wherefore, if the earth is
      really at rest, the body, which relatively rests in the ship, will really
      and absolutely move with the same velocity which the ship has on the
      earth. But if the earth also moves, the true and absolute motion of the
      body will arise partly form the true motion of the earth in immovable
      space, partly from the relative motion of the ship on the earth; and if
      the body moves also relatively in the ship its true motion will arise
      partly from the true motion of the earth in immovable space, and partly
      from the relative motions as well of the ship on the earth as of the body
      in the ship, and from these relative motions will arise the relative
      motion of the body on the earth. As if that part of the earth where the
      ship is was truly moved toward the east with a velocity of 10010 parts,
      while the ship itself, with a fresh gale and full sails is carried towards
      the west with a velocity expressed by 10 of those parts, but a sailor
      walks in the ship towards the east with 1 part of the said velocity, then
      the sailor will be moved truly in immovable space towards the east with a
      velocity of 10001 parts, and relatively on the earth towards the west with
      a velocity of 9 of those parts.

      This result might have been foreseen by noticing that mechanics
      necessarily deals with equations, and that an algebraic equation always
      expresses something already done. Now it is of the very essence of
      duration and motion, as they appear to our consciousness, to be something
      that is unceasingly being done; thus algebra can represent the results
      gained at a certain moment of duration and the positions occupied by a
      certain moving body in space, but not duration and motion themselves.
      Mathematics may, indeed, increase the number of simultaneities and
      positions which it takes into consideration by making the intervals very
      small: it may even, by using the differential instead of the difference,
      show that it is possible to increase without limit the number of these
      intervals of duration. Nevertheless, however small the interval is
      supposed to be, it is the extremity of the interval at which mathematics
      always places itself. As for the interval itself, as for the duration and
      the motion, they are necessarily left out of the equation. The reason is
      that duration and motion are mental syntheses, and not objects; that,
      although the moving body occupies, one after the other, points on a line,
      motion itself has nothing to do with a line; and finally that, although
      the positions occupied by the moving body vary with the different moments
      of duration, though it even creates distinct moments by the mere fact of
      occupying different positions, duration properly so called has no moments
      which are identical or external to one another, being essentially
      heterogeneous, continuous and with no analogy to number.

      It follows from this analysis that space alone is homogeneous, that
      objects in space form a discrete multiplicity, and that every discrete
      multiplicity is got by a process of unfolding in space. It also follows
      that there is neither duration nor even succession in space if we give to
      these words the meaning in which consciousness takes them: each of the
      so-called successive states of the external world exists alone; their
      multiplicity is real only for a consciousness that can first remain them
      and then set them side by side by externalizing them in relations to one
      another.

      From our everyday experience we know that the sun emits light and heat as
      well as the rays which give us a suntan. Although these forms of energy
      comprise a major portion of the total energy that radiates from the sun,
      they are only a part of a large array of energy called radiation, or
      electromagnetic radiation... All radiation, whether X rays, radio, or heat
      waves, is capable of transmitting energy through the vacuum of space at
      300,000 kilometers per second and only slightly slower through air.
      Nineteenth century physicists were so puzzled by the seemingly impossible
      task of energy traveling without a medium to transmit it that they assumed
      that a material, which they named ether, existed between the sun and the
      earth. This medium was thought to transmit radiant energy in much the same
      way that air transmits sound waves produced by the vibration of one
      person's vocal cords to another persons' eardrums. Today we know that,
      like gravity, radiation requires no material to transmit it. Yet,
      physicists still do not know how this is possible.
