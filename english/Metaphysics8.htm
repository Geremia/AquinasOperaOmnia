        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 1: 1042a 3-1042b 8
      </p>
      <p>
        691. It is necessary, then, to argue from the points which have been
        made, and after making a summary, to bring our investigations to a
        close.
      </p>
      <p>
        692. It has been stated that it is the causes, principles and elements
        of substances which are being sought (564).
      </p>
      <p>
        693. Now some substances are admitted by all; but there are others about
        which some thinkers have expressed views peculiar to themselves. Those
        which are admitted by all are physical substances, such as fire, earth,
        water and the other simple bodies; plants and their parts; animals and
        the parts of animals; and finally the heaven and its parts. But certain
        other thinkers make the peculiar claim that the Forms and the objects of
        mathematics are substances (566).
      </p>
      <p>
        694. From other arguments it also follows that there are other
        substances, i.e., the essence and the underlying subject. Again, from
        another point of view a genus is substance to a greater degree than
        species, and a universal to a greater degree than singular things (568).
        And the Ideas have a connection with the universal and the genus, for
        they seem to be substances on the same grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        695. Further, since the essence is substance, and the definition is the
        intelligible expression of the essence, for this reason we have examined
        both the definition and everything that is predicated essentially
        (576-597). And since the definition of a thing is its intelligible
        expression, and the intelligible expression has parts, then concerning
        the notion of part it was also necessary to consider what things are
        parts of substance and what are not, and whether these are necessary to
        the definition (625-649). Further, neither the universal nor the genus
        is substance (650-681). Related questions concerning the Ideas and the
        objects of mathematics must be examined later on; for some say that
        these are substances in addition to sensible ones. But now we must treat
        those things which all admit to be substances, and these are sensible
        substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        696. All sensible substances have matter. And the underlying subject is
        substance; in one sense the matter (by matter I mean that which is not a
        particular thing actually but potentially); and in another sense the
        intelligible structure or form, which is a particular thing and is
        separable in thought; and in a third sense the thing composed of these,
        which alone is subject to generation and corruption, and is separable in
        an absolute sense. For according to the intelligible structure of
        substances, some are separable and others are not.
      </p>
      <p>
        697. Now it is evident that matter is substance; for in every process of
        change between contraries there is something which underlies these
        changes. For example, in change of place, there is something which is
        now here and afterwards somewhere else; and in change of size, that
        which is now of such a size and afterwards smaller or greater; and in
        change of quality, that which is now healthy and afterwards diseased.
        And similarly in change of substance there is something which is now in
        the process of generation and afterwards in the process of corruption,
        and which is now a subject and this particular thing and afterwards a
        subject of privation.
      </p>
      <p>
        698. And the other changes follow upon this change, but this change does
        not follow upon one or two of the others. For if a thing has matter
        which is subject to change of place, it is not necessary that it also
        have matter which is generable and corruptible. The difference between
        coming-to-be in an absolute sense and coming-to-be in a qualified sense
        has been explained in the <i>Physics</i>.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1681. Having dealt with substance by means of the dialectical method in
        Book VII, i.e., by examining the definition and its parts and other
        things of this kind which are considered from the viewpoint of
        dialectics, the Philosopher now intends in Book VIII to deal with
        sensible substances through their proper principles, by applying to
        those substances the things that were investigated above by means of the
        dialectical method.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is divided into two parts. In the first (691:C 1681), he links up
        this discussion with the preceding one; and in the second (696:C 1686),
        he carries out his intention (“All sensible substances”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he states in a
        general way what he intends to do. Second (692:C 1682), he repeats some
        of the statements which have been made (“It has been stated”). Third
        (695:C 1685), he links up the foregoing discussion with the one that is
        to come (“Further, since the essence”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says first (691), then, that since many of the statements made about
        substance in Book VII belong to the consideration of dialectics, we must
        reason from the statements which have been made in order that the things
        stated from the viewpoint of dialectics may be applied to things
        existing in reality. And “after making a summary,” i.e., after bringing
        these together again in a brief and summary way, we must bring our
        investigation to a close by completing the treatise on substance. He
        does this by discussing those things which were omitted from the
        foregoing treatise.
      </p>
      <p>
        1682. <span style="font-weight: bold">It has been stated</span> (692).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he repeats some of the statements which have been made, because it
        was stated in Book VII (564:C 1260) that the principal objects of our
        search in this science are the causes, principles and elements of
        substances. For since this science investigates as its proper subject
        being in general, and this is divided into substance and the nine
        classes of accidents, and a knowledge of accidents depends upon
        substance, as was shown in Book VII (585-6:C 1342-50), it follows that
        this science is principally concerned with substances. And since we know
        each thing only when we know its principles and causes, it also follows
        that this science must be principally concerned with the principles,
        causes and elements of substances. The way in which these three differ
        has been shown above in Book V (403-12:C 751-807).
      </p>
      <p>
        1683. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now some substances</span> (693).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he repeats one of the points discussed above, i.e., the various
        senses in which substance is used. First, he gives the things which are
        said to be real substances. Among these there are some whose existence
        is admitted by all thinkers, namely, sensible substances, such as earth,
        water and the other elements; and above these, in the order of their
        nobility and perfection, plants and animals and their parts; and lastly
        the heaven and its parts, as the orbs and the stars, which surpass in
        nobility the other sensible substances. However, there are some
        substances whose existence is not admitted by all but only by certain
        particular thinkers, who claim that the Forms and the objects of
        mathematics have separate existence. They adopted this position because
        they thought that for every abstraction of the intellect there is a
        corresponding abstraction in reality. Thus, because the intellect
        considers the universal apart from particular things, as “man” apart
        from Socrates and Plato, they held that the Forms have separate
        existence of themselves. And since the intellect considers some forms
        apart from sensible material things, as curvature (whose concept does
        not contain nose as does the concept of pugnose) and a line and other
        things of this kind, which we call the objects of mathematics, they also
        held that the objects of mathematics have separate existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        1684. <span style="font-weight: bold">From other arguments</span> (694).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the different ways in which substance is considered from
        the viewpoint of its intelligible structure; and there are two of these.
        The first is that substance means the quiddity of any natural substance,
        and this is merely the whatness of a natural being. In the second way
        substance is considered in a different sense, that is, in the sense that
        a genus is said to be substance to a greater degree than species, and a
        universal to a greater degree than singular things, as some men held
        according to what was treated in the questions in Book III (220-234:C
        423-442). And with this way of considering substance, according to which
        both a genus and a universal are called substances, is connected the
        theory of Ideas, or Forms as Aristotle called them above (693:C 1683);
        for this theory maintains that both Ideas and universals are substances
        on the same grounds.
      </p>
      <p>1685. Further, since the essence (695).</p>
      <p>
        He links up this discussion with the preceding one by stating what has
        been solved and what remains to be solved. He says that, since the
        essence is substance, and the intelligible expression which signifies it
        is the definition, for this reason it was necessary in the preceding
        book to deal with definition. And since a definition is composed of
        those attributes which are predicated of a thing essentially, for this
        reason it was also necessary in that book to settle the issue about
        essential predication (576-597:C 1299-1380). Further, since the
        definition of a thing is its intelligible expression, and this is made
        up of parts, then concerning the parts of a definition it was also
        necessary to determine what parts are parts of the thing defined and
        what are not; and whether the parts of the definition and those of the
        thing defined are the same (625-649:C 1482-1565). Another text has
        “Whether the parts of the definition must be defined,” but the first
        version is better. In Book VII (650-681:C 1566-1647) it was shown also
        that neither the universal nor the genus is substance. Thus the entire
        study which may be made of definitions and substance was carried out in
        Book VII. But of those substances which exist in reality, it will be
        necessary to examine later the Ideas and the objects of mathematics,
        which one school of thinkers claim to subsist by themselves apart from
        sensible substances. This is done in the last books of this work. But
        now it is necessary to treat at once of those substances which all men
        admit to exist, namely, sensible substances, so that we may proceed from
        what has been made evident to what as yet remains unknown.
      </p>
      <p><i>Sensible substance is matter, form, composite.</i></p>
      <p>
        1686.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">All sensible substances</span> (696).
      </p>
      <p>
        Having linked up the foregoing discussion with the one that is to come,
        the Philosopher begins here to treat of sensible substances by
        investigating their principles. This is divided into two parts. In the
        first (1686) he establishes what is true concerning
        <span style="font-weight: bold">matter and form</span>, which are the
        principles of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">sensible substances</span>. In the
        second (1755) he considers the way in which they are united to each
        other (“It seems that we must”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows that matter
        and form are principles of sensible substances. Second (1705), he deals
        with those points which must be investigated about each of these
        principles (“And we must not”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows that matter
        is a principle of sensible substances; and second (1691), that the same
        is true of form (“But since that which has the character of a subject”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First he shows what
        <span style="font-weight: bold">matter</span> is by distinguishing it
        from the other ways in which substance is considered. Hence he says that
        all sensible substances have matter; and the reason is that all are in
        motion, and motion does not exist without matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1687. But it must be noted that in one sense <i>substance</i> means (1)
        matter, and in another (2) form, and in still another (3) the thing
        composed of these.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <i>matter</i> is called substance, not as though it were a being
        considered to have actual existence in itself, but as something
        <span style="font-weight: bold">capable</span> of being actual (and this
        is said to be a particular thing).
      </p>
      <p>
        And <i>form</i>, which is also termed the intelligible structure because
        the intelligible structure of the species is derived from it, is called
        substance (1) inasmuch as it is something
        <span style="font-weight: bold">actual</span>, and (2) inasmuch as it is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">separable</span> from matter in thought
        but not in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the thing <i>composed</i> of these is called substance inasmuch as
        it is something “separable in an absolute sense,” i.e.,
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >capable of existing separately by itself</span
        >
        in reality; and it alone is subject to generation and corruption. For
        form and matter are generated and corrupted only by reason of something
        else.
      </p>
      <p>
        And although the composite is separable in an absolute sense, yet some
        of the other things which are called substances are separable in thought
        and some are not. For a <i>form</i> is separable in thought because it
        can be understood without understanding individuating sensible matter;
        but <i>matter</i> cannot be understood without understanding form, since
        it is apprehended only inasmuch as it is in potentiality to form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or the, statements can mean that “according to the intelligible
        structure of substances,” i.e., of forms, some are separable in their
        intelligible structure, as the objects of mathematics, and some are not,
        as natural forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or again it may mean that there are certain separate forms existing
        without matter, about which he will establish the truth later on
        (2447-2454).
      </p>
      <p>
        1688. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now it is evident</span> (697).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he says that in sensible substances we must posit
        <i>matter</i> as <span style="font-weight: bold">substance</span> and
        <span style="font-weight: bold">subject</span>. For in every change
        between contraries, there must be a subject common to the termini of the
        change. For example, in change of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">place</span> there is a common subject
        which is now here and afterwards somewhere else; and in
        <span style="font-weight: bold">growth</span> there is a common subject
        which now has so much quantity and afterwards is smaller (if the change
        is decrease) or greater (if it is increase). And in
        <span style="font-weight: bold">alteration</span> there is a common
        subject which is now healthy and afterwards diseased. Hence, since there
        is <span style="font-weight: bold">substantial change</span>, that is,
        generation and corruption, there must be a common subject which
        underlies the opposite changes of generation and corruption. And this is
        the subject for the termini that have been given, i.e., form and
        privation, so that sometimes this subject is actual by reason of a form,
        and sometimes it is the subject of the privation of that form.
      </p>
      <p>
        1689. Now from this argument of Aristotle it is clear that substantial
        generation and corruption are the source from which we derive our
        knowledge of prime matter. For if prime matter by nature had a form of
        its own, it would be an actual thing by reason of that form. Hence, when
        an additional form would be given [to prime matter], such matter would
        not exist in an absolute sense by reason of that form but would become
        this or that being; and then there would be generation in a qualified
        sense but not in an absolute sense. Hence all those who held that this
        first subject is a body, such as air or water, claimed that generation
        is the same as alteration. But it is clear from this argument what we
        must hold prime matter to be; for it is related to all forms and
        privations as the subject of qualitative change is to contrary
        qualities.
      </p>
      <p>
        1690.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">And the other changes</span> (698).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that matter is not present in the same way in all sensible
        substances. He says that the other changes follow upon matter which is
        subject to generation and corruption; for if matter is subject to
        generation and corruption, it follows that it is subject to alteration
        and change of place. But this matter, i.e., one which is subject to
        generation and corruption, does not follow upon all the other changes,
        especially change of place. For if something has “matter which is
        subject to change of place,” i.e., by which it is potentially in a
        place, it does not follow that it also has “matter which is generable
        and corruptible,” namely, one which is subject to generation and
        corruption. For this kind of matter is lacking in the celestial bodies,
        in which there is a kind of alteration inasmuch as they are illuminated
        and deprived of light, but neither generation nor corruption. Hence he
        said one” because of change of place, or two” because of the kind of
        alteration just mentioned, although this is really not alteration,
        because illumination is not motion but the terminus of motion. Thus we
        must posit matter for every change according as there is in everything
        that changes a coming-to-be either in an absolute sense or in a
        qualified one. The difference between coming-to-be in an absolute sense
        and in a qualified one has been explained in the <i>Physics</i>, Book 1;
        4 for coming-to-be in an absolute sense belongs to substance, and
        coming-to-be in a qualified sense belongs to accidents.<br />

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 2: 1042b 9-1043a 28
      </p>
      <p>
        699. But since that which has the character of a subject or matter has
        been admitted by all to be substance, and this is what is in
        potentiality, it remains to explain what it is that constitutes the
        substance of sensible things in the sense of actuality.
      </p>
      <p>
        700. Now Democritus is like one who thinks that there are three
        differences in things. For he holds that the underlying body, as matter,
        is the same for all things, but that it differs in contour, which is
        shape; or in disposition, which is position; or in distribution, which
        is arrangement.
      </p>
      <p>
        701. However, there seem to be many differences inasmuch as some things
        are said to be by reason of the way in which their material parts are
        combined; for example, some things are combined by mixture, as
        honey-water; others by a binding, as the binding around a head; others
        by birdlime, as a book; others by a nail, as a chest; and others in
        several of these ways. Others differ by position, as a threshold and a
        lintel, for these differ in a sense according to their position; others
        differ in point of time, as dinner and breakfast; others with respect to
        place, as the air currents; others by reason of sensible properties, as
        hardness and softness, density and rarity, dryness and moistness. And
        some things differ by some of these differences and others by all taken
        together; some by excess and others by defect.
      </p>
      <p>
        702. For this reason it is evident that being is also used in the same
        number of ways; for a threshold is such because it is placed in this
        particular position, and to be a threshold means to be placed in such
        and such a position; and to be ice means to be congealed in such and
        such a way. However, the being of some things will be defined in all of
        these ways: one by being mixed; others by being combined; others by
        being tied together; others by being condensed; and others by other
        differences, as a hand and a foot.
      </p>
      <p>
        703. Further, we must consider the classes of differences, for these
        will be the principles of being of things, as differences in degree, or
        in density and rarity, and others such as these; for all are instances
        of excess and defect. Indeed, if [anything differs] either in figure or
        in smoothness and roughness [these are reducible to differences] in
        straightness and curvature. Further, the being of some things will
        consist in being mixed, and their non-being will consist in the opposite
        state.
      </p>
      <p>
        704. It is evident, then, from these instances that, if substance is the
        cause of the being of each thing which is composed of these differences,
        we must look for the cause of the being of each one of these among these
        differences. Now substances is none of these differences nor any
        combination of them; yet it is found analogously in each. And just as in
        the case of substance that which is predicated of matter is the
        actuality itself, in a similar way this is most true in the case of
        other definitions. Thus if a threshold has to be defined, we shall say
        that it is a piece of wood or stone placed in such and such a position;
        and we shall say that a house is bricks and timbers placed in such and
        such a position. (Or again in some cases there is also the final cause).
        And if ice is to be defined, we shall say that it is water frozen or
        condensed in such and such a way; and we shall say that a harmony is
        such and such a combination of high and low notes. [And we must proceed]
        in the same way too in other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        705. From these instances, then, it is evident that different matters
        have a different actuality and intelligible structure; for of some
        things it is combination, of others mixing, and of others some of those
        differences mentioned above.
      </p>
      <p>
        706. Therefore, among those who give definitions, those who state what a
        house is by saying that it is stones, bricks and timbers, are speaking
        of a potential house; for these are its matter. But those who say that
        it is a shelter for protecting goods and bodies, or by adding some other
        such property, speak of its actuality. And those who speak of both of
        these together speak of the third kind of substance, which is the thing
        composed of these. For the intelligible structure which is expressed by
        means of differences seems to be that of the form or actuality of a
        thing, but that which is expressed by a thing’s intrinsic parts is
        rather that of its matter. The same thing is true of the definitions of
        which Archytas approved, for they are both of these together. For
        example, What is stillness? Rest in a large expanse of air, where air is
        as matter and rest as actuality or substance. What is a calm? Smoothness
        of the sea, where the sea is as subject or matter, and smoothness as
        actuality or form.
      </p>
      <p>
        707. From what has been said, then, it is evident what sensible
        substance is and how it exists; for in one sense it has the character of
        matter, and in another the character of form (because it is actuality),
        and in a third sense it is the thing composed of these.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1691. Having investigated the material principle in sensible substances,
        the Philosopher examines their formal principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        First (699:C 1691), he links up this discussion with the foregoing one,
        saying that, since all recognize substance in the sense of matter and
        subject (for even the oldest philosophers held that matter is the
        substance of material things), and this kind of substance is something
        potential, it now remains to explain what form is, which is the
        actuality of sensible things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1692.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Now Democritus is like one</span> (700).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he carries out his intention; and in regard to this he does two
        things. First (700:C 1692), he examines the differences in sensible
        things which indicate a formal principle. Second (705:C 1699), he draws
        some conclusions (“From these instances”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he examines certain
        accidental differences of sensible things. Second (704:C 1696), he shows
        how these differences are related to substantial differences (“It is
        evident”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he investigates the
        accidental differences of sensible things. Second (702:C 1694), he shows
        how these differences are related to those things whose differences they
        are (“For this reason”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First (700), he gives
        Democritus’ opinion about the differences of things. He says that
        Democritus is like one who thinks “that there are three differences in
        things,” i.e., according to the principles which he gives he seems to
        think that all differences of things are reduced to three classes. For
        he held that the material principles of things are indivisible bodies,
        which, being of the same nature, are similar to each other; but that
        they constitute a diversity of things because they differ in position,
        shape and arrangement. Thus he seems to hold that the underlying body,
        as a material principle, is one and the same in nature even though it is
        divided into an infinite number of parts, and that it differ’s, i.e., is
        divided into different things, because of differences in shape, position
        and arrangement. For things differ in figure by being straight or
        curved; in position by being above or below, right or left; and in
        arrangement by being before or after.
      </p>
      <p>
        1693.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">However, there seem to be</span> (701).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he shows that the position of Democritus is unsatisfactory,
        because there seem to be many other differences of things which are not
        reducible to the foregoing ones. For some things differ by reason of the
        different way in which their material parts are combined: in some things
        the material parts are combined by being mixed, as honey-water; in
        others, by being tied together by some bond, as the binding around a
        woman’s’ head; in others by glue or birdlime, as occurs in books; in
        others by a nail, as occurs in a chest; and in others the parts are
        united in several of the aforesaid ways. On the other hand, some things
        differ from each other by their position, as a lintel and a threshold,
        which differ because they are placed in such and such a way-one being
        above and the other below. Again, some differ in point of time, as
        dinner, which is the late meal, from breakfast, which is the early
        morning meal. Others differ with respect to place, as “the air
        currents,” i.e., the winds, of which the Aquilonian comes from the
        north, the Favonian from the west, the Austerian from the south, and the
        Subsolian from the east. Others differ “by reason of the qualities of
        sensible bodies,” i.e., by hardness or softness and other
        characteristics of this kind; and some things differ in several of these
        ways, and others in all of them. And some differ by excess and some by
        defect. He adds this because the ancient philosophers held that all
        qualities of sensible bodies are reduced to excess or defect.
      </p>
      <p>1694. <span style="font-weight: bold">For this reason</span> (702).</p>
      <p>
        He shows the way in which these differences are related to those things
        whose differences they are. In regard to this he does two things. First
        (702), he shows that these differences constitute the being of the
        things whose differences they are. Second (703:C 1695), he concludes
        that in order to grasp the principles of being we must reduce these
        differences to certain primary classes of differences (“Further, we must
        consider”).
      </p>
      <p>
        First, then, he says that, because these differences are constitutive of
        the things we have mentioned above, it is evident that the being of the
        aforesaid realities is diversified according to these differences; for a
        difference completes the definition, which signifies the being of a
        thing. Thus a threshold is this particular thing “because it is placed
        in such and such a position,” and its being, i.e., its proper
        intelligible structure, consists in being placed in such and such a
        position. Similarly, being ice is being condensed in such and such a
        way. And by each of the differences mentioned the being of things of a
        certain type is differentiated: some by being mixed; others by being
        combined; and others by other differences, as a hand and a foot and
        other parts of this kind which have peculiar differences of their own
        inasmuch as they are directed to certain definite operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        1695.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, we must consider</span> (703).
      </p>
      <p>
        He concludes that, since the being of things consists in their
        differences and has to be known in this way, it will be worth our while
        to grasp the classes of differences by reducing the secondary
        differences of a class to the primary differences; because common and
        proper differences of this kind will be the principles of being of a
        whole class. This is evident in differences of degree, of rarity and
        density, and in other things of this kind; for density and rarity and
        the like are reduced to the class of the great and small, because all
        these signify excess and defect. Similarly, if things differ in figure
        or in roughness or smoothness, these are reduced to differences of
        straightness and curvature, which are the primary differences of figure.
        Again, it is necessary that some be reduced to being mixed or not being
        mixed; for the being of some things consists in the fact that they are
        mixed, and their non-being in just the opposite state.
      </p>
      <p>
        1696. <span style="font-weight: bold">It is evident, then</span> (704).
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows how these differences are related to the substances of things.
        He says that it is now evident from the foregoing that we must try to
        discover in these differences the formal cause of the being of each
        thing, if it is in this way that substance in a formal sense, or the
        whatness of a thing, is the cause of the being of each thing, as was
        clear in Book VII (682-90:C 1648-80). For these differences signify the
        form or whatness of the above-mentioned things. However, none of these
        differences are substance or anything akin to substance, as though
        belonging to the genus of substance; but the same proportion is found in
        them as in [the genus of] substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        1697. For just as in the genus of substance the <i>difference</i>, which
        is predicated of the genus and qualifies it in order to constitute a
        species, is related to the genus as
        <span style="font-weight: bold">actuality or form</span>, so also is
        this true in other definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        (~) For we must not understand that difference is form or that genus is
        matter, since genus and difference are predicated of the species but
        matter and form are not predicated of the composite. (+) But we speak in
        this manner because a thing’s genus is derived from its material
        principle, and its difference from its formal principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The genus of man, for example, is animal, because it signifies something
        having a sensory nature, which is related as matter to intellectual
        nature from which rational, the difference of man, is taken. But
        rational signifies something having an intellectual nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is for this reason that a genus contains its differences potentially,
        and that genus and difference are proportionate to matter and form, as
        Porphyry says. And for this reason too it is said here that “actuality,”
        i.e., difference, is predicated “of matter,” i.e., of the genus; and the
        same thing occurs in other genera.
      </p>
      <p>
        1698. For if one wishes to define a threshold, he shall say that it is a
        piece of stone or wood placed in such and such a position; and in this
        definition stone or wood is as matter and position as form. Similarly,
        in the definition of a house stones and timbers are as matter, and being
        combined in such and such a way as form. And again in the definitions of
        some things there is also added its end, on which the necessity of the
        form depends. And similarly in the definition of ice, water is as matter
        and being frozen is as form. So too in the definition of a harmony the
        high and low notes are as matter and the way in which they are combined
        is as form. The same thing applies in all other definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        1699. <span style="font-weight: bold">From these instances</span> (705).
      </p>
      <p>
        He draws two additional conclusions from the above. First, there are
        different actualities or forms for different matters. For in some things
        the actuality consists in being combined; in others in being mixed, or
        in some of the aforesaid differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        1700.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore, among those who</span> (706).
      </p>
      <p>
        He states the second conclusion; since in a definition one part,is
        related to the other as actuality to matter, some people in defining
        things give an inadequate definition by stating only their matter, as
        those who define a house by means of cement, stones and timbers, which
        are the material of a house; because such a definition does not signify
        an actual house but a potential one. Those who say that a house is a
        shelter for goods and living bodies state the form of a house but not
        its matter. However, those who state both define the composite
        substance, and therefore their definition is a complete definition. But
        the conceptual element which is derived from the differences pertains to
        the form, whereas that which is derived from the intrinsic parts
        pertains to the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1701. The definitions which Archytas accepts are similar to these. E.g.,
        stillness, which signifies the state of the atmosphere when it is
        windless, is rest in a large expanse of air; for if only the smallest
        amount of air in a vessel is at rest we do not speak of stillness. In
        this definition air is as matter and rest as form. Similarly, when a
        calm is defined as the smoothness of the sea, the sea is as matter and
        smoothness as form. Now in these definitions the matter is substance and
        the form is an accident; but in the definition of a house the matter is
        its parts and the actuality is the form of the whole.
      </p>
      <p>1702. <span style="font-weight: bold">From what</span> (707).</p>
      <p>
        He summarizes the things said about form. The text is clear here.<br />

      </p>
      <p>
        708. And we must not disregard the fact that sometimes it is not
        apparent whether a name signifies the composite substance or the
        actuality or form; for example, whether house signifies both the form
        and the matter together, i.e., a shelter composed of bricks, timbers and
        stones arranged in such and such a way, or whether it signifies the
        actuality or form—a shelter; and whether line signifies twoness in
        length or twoness; and whether animal signifies a soul in a body or a
        soul, for the latter is the substance or actuality of some body.
      </p>
      <p>
        709. Now animal will also apply to both, not in the sense that both are
        expressed by one meaning, but insofar as they are related to some one
        thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        710. These distinctions make a difference with regard to something else,
        but not to the investigation of sensible substances, because the essence
        of this other thing consists of form or actuality. For a soul and the
        essence of a soul are the same, but a man and the essence of a man are
        not the same, unless a man is also called a soul. And in some things
        essence and thing are identical and in others not.
      </p>
      <p>
        711. Accordingly, to those who make investigations it does not seem that
        a syllable consists of letters and their combination, nor does a house
        consist of bricks and their combination. And this is true, because a
        combination or mixture does not consist of the things of which it is the
        combination or mixture. Nor likewise do any of the other differences. If
        a threshold, for example, is constituted by its position, the position
        is not constituted by the threshold, but rather the latter by the
        former. Nor is man animal and two-footed, but there must be something
        else in addition to these, if these are matter. Now this is neither an
        element nor a combination of the elements, but the substance; but
        omitting this they speak only of matter. Therefore, if this is the cause
        of a thing’s being, and this is its substance, they will not be stating
        its substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        712. Now this must be either eternal or corruptible without being in the
        process of corruption, and generated without being in the process of
        generation. But it has been demonstrated and made clear elsewhere (611)
        that no one produces a form, nor is it generated; but it is this
        particular thing which is produced and comes to be from these
        principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        713. But whether the substances of corruptible things are separable or
        not is not yet clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        714. It is evident, however, that this may not occur in the case of some
        things, i.e., in the case of all those that are incapable of existing
        apart from particular things, for exatnple, a house or a vessel.
      </p>
      <p>
        715. Indeed, perhaps neither these particular things nor any of the
        others which are not produced by nature are substances. For at least one
        might hold that only the nature of corruptible things is substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        716. For this reason the problem which confronted Antisthenes and other
        uninstructed people is applicable here, i.e., that one cannot define
        what a thing is (for according to them the definition is a lengthy
        statement), but one can say what it is like; for example, one cannot say
        what silver is, but one can say that it is like tin. Hence, of one kind
        of substance there can be a limit or definition, i.e., of the composite,
        whether it be sensible or intelligible. But this cannot be true of the
        primary parts of which it is composed, since the definitive concept
        designates something as determining something else, and one of these
        must have the character of matter and the other that of form.
      </p>
      <p>
        717. Further, it is also clear that if numbers are in any sense
        substances, they are such in this way and not (as groups) of units, as
        some claim. For a definition is like a number and is divisible into
        indivisible parts, because definitions are not made up of an unlimited
        number of parts; and this is also true of numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        718. And just as when any part constituting a number is subtracted or
        added it is no longer the same number that remains but a different one,
        even though the minimum is subtracted or added, so too neither the
        definition nor the essence will any longer be the same when anything is
        subtracted or added.
      </p>
      <p>
        719. And there must be something by reason of which a number is one
        thing, although they cannot say what makes it to be one thing; i.e., if
        it is one thing. For either it is not one thing but like a heap, or if
        it is one thing it is necessary to state what makes it to be one thing
        out of many. And a definition is one thing; but they are also unable to
        say what makes it to be one thing; and this follows as a natural
        consequence. For by the same argument substance is also one thing in the
        way we have explained, but not, as some claim, as being a kind of unit
        or point, but as an actuality and a kind of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        720. And just as number does not admit of more or less, neither does
        substance in the sense of form; but if this were the case [it would be
        that substance which is joined] to matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        721. In regard to the generation and corruption of the foregoing
        substances, in what way this is possible and in what way it is
        impossible, and in regard to the likeness which they have to numbers, we
        have established these things this far.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1703. Having investigated the principles of sensible substances~ and
        having shown that sensible substances are composed of matter and form,
        the Philosopher’s aim here is to establish the truth about the formal
        and material principles of things by investigating the points which must
        be considered about each.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is divided into two parts. In the first (708:C 1705), he
        investigates the things which must be considered about the formal
        principle. In the second (722:C 1729), he investigates the things which
        must be considered about the material principle (“Concerning material
        substances”).
      </p>
      <p>
        1704. And since Plato was the one who devoted special treatment to the
        formal principle, therefore Aristotle deals with the formal principle in
        reference to those things which Plato posited. Now Plato claimed that
        species [i.e., separate Forms or Ideas] and numbers are the forms of
        things. Hence the first part is divided into two sections. In the first
        (708:C 1705), he deals with the formal principle in relation to the
        species [or Ideas]; and in the second (717:C 1722), in relation to
        numbers (“Further, it is also clear”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now Plato held four things about forms in relation to the species [or
        Ideas]. The first of these is that specific names signify form alone and
        not form with matter. The second is that form is something besides the
        material parts. The third is that form can neither be generated nor
        corrupted. The fourth is that forms are separate from sensible things.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into four sections inasmuch as Aristotle
        investigates the four points just mentioned. The second (711:C 1712)
        begins where he says “Accordingly, to those.” The third (712:C 1715)
        begins where he says “Now this must.” The fourth (713:C 1717) begins
        where he says “But whether.”
      </p>
      <p>
        1705. In regard to the first he does three things. First (708) he raises
        a question. We must understand, he says, that for some men there is the
        problem whether a specific name signifies the composite substance or
        only the form or something having the status of actuality; for example,
        whether the word house signifies both matter and form together so that a
        house means a shelter made of bricks and stones properly arranged (for
        shelter is as form, and bricks and stones as matter), or whether this
        word signifies only the actuality or form, a shelter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1706. Similarly, there is the problem whether the word line signifies
        twoness and length or twoness alone. He mentions this because the
        Platonists claimed that numbers are the forms of continuous quantities;
        for they said that a point is merely the number one having position, so
        that position is a sort of material principle, and the number one a
        formal principle. They likewise claimed that the number two is the form
        of a line, so that a line is merely twoness in length. Therefore the
        Philosopher asks whether the word line signifies twoness alone as form,
        or twoness grounded in length as form in matter. And again, there is the
        problem whether the word animal signifies a soul in a body as a form in
        matter, or only a soul, which is the form of an organic body.
      </p>
      <p>
        1707.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Now animal will also apply</span> (709).
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows what follows if one says that specific names are used in both
        senses, so that they sometimes signify form alone and sometimes form in
        matter. And the result is that animal will be taken of either in either
        meaning, not univocally, as though it were predicated with one meaning,
        but analogically, as happens in the case of those things which have one
        name because they are related to one thing. For the specific name will
        be predicated of the composite only by reason of relationship to that
        which is predicated according to form alone, as the Platonists held. For
        they maintained that man, who is a composite of matter and form, is so
        named because he participates in the Idea man, which is only a form.
      </p>
      <p>
        1708. <span style="font-weight: bold">These distinctions</span> (710).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the Philosopher shows the result to which the aforesaid search
        leads. He says that, while the question whether a specific name
        signifies the composite substance or only the form, (+) makes a
        difference in regard to something else, (~) it makes no difference to
        the investigation of sensible substance. For it is evident that a
        sensible substance is composed of matter and form.
      </p>
      <p>
        1709. (+) Now to what kind of thing it makes a difference, whether to
        those in this state or in another, he makes clear next. For it is
        obvious that if there is something which is only form or actuality, its
        essence “consists of this,” i.e., the thing and its essence will be
        identical, as a soul is identical with its essence, or is its own
        quiddity.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if a thing is composed of matter and form, then in this case the
        thing itself and its essence will not be the same; for example, a man
        and the essence of a man are not the same, unless perhaps a man is said
        to be only a soul, as was held by those who say that specific names
        signify only the form. Thus it is evident that something does exist
        whose essence is the same as itself, namely, whatever is not composed of
        matter and form but is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">only a form</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        1710. The reason for this position is that essence is what the
        definition signifies, and the definition signifies the nature of the
        species. But if there is something which is composed of matter and form,
        then in that thing there must be some other principle besides the nature
        of the species. For since matter is the principle of individuation, then
        in anything composed of matter and form there must be certain
        individuating principles distinct from the nature of the species. Hence
        such a thing is not just its own essence but is something in addition to
        this. But if such a thing exists which is only a form, it will have
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >no individuating principles in addition to the nature of its
          species</span
        >. For a form that exists of itself is individuated of itself. Therefore
        this thing is nothing else than its own essence.
      </p>
      <p>
        1711. It is clear, then, that if the specific name signifies
        <span style="font-weight: bold">only the form</span>, the essence of
        anything will be (+) the same as its being, as a man will be his
        essence, and a horse its essence, and so also will all other things of
        this kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if specific names signify things
        <span style="font-weight: bold">composed</span> of matter and form, then
        such things will (~) not be the same as their essence.
      </p>
      <p>
        1712.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Accordingly, to those who</span> (711).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he deals with the second point mentioned above, namely, that the
        form is something in addition to the material parts. He says that for
        the Platonists, in raising this question, it does not seem that a
        syllable consists of its elements and their combination, as if
        combination, which is the form of a syllable, were a material part of a
        syllable like its elements or letters. Nor does it seem to them that a
        house consists of stones and their combination, as if a house were
        constituted of these as material parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        1713. And on this point their remarks are true, because, if the form
        were one of the material parts, it would depend on matter. But we see
        that this is false; for combination or mixture, which are formal
        principles, are not constituted of those things which are combined or
        mixed; nor is any other formal principle constituted of its matter, but
        the reverse. For a threshold is constituted by position, which is its
        form, and not the reverse.
      </p>
      <p>
        1714. Therefore, if one holds that animal and two-footed are the matter
        of man, man will not be animal and two-footed but will be something else
        in addition to these. And this will not be an element or anything
        composed of the elements but will be only a form as the Platonists
        claim, who omit matter from definitions. But it seems that we must hold,
        in opposition to this position, that, if form alone apart from matter is
        the substance or principle of being of a thing, they will not be able to
        say that this particular thing is that separate substance; i.e., they
        will not be able to say that this man as a sensible entity is composed
        of matter and form, but that man is only a form
      </p>
      <p>1715. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now this must</span> (712).</p>
      <p>
        He considers the third point mentioned above, namely, the Platonists’
        position that forms are eternal and Incorruptible. Hence he concludes,
        from what has been said, that either a form must be eternal, as the
        Platonists held when they claimed that the Ideas, which they called the
        forms of things, are eternal; or a form must be corruptible by reason of
        something else without being corrupted in itself, and similarly it must
        come to be by reason of something else without coming to be in itself.
        This is in agreement with the position of Aristotle, who does not hold
        that forms are separate but that they exist in matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1716. Further, the statement that forms can neither be corrupted nor
        generated in themselves (710-12:C 1708-15), on which each of the
        aforesaid points depends, Aristotle proceeds to demonstrate by reason of
        what was shown above, namely, that no one makes or produces a form, nor
        is a form generated or produced in itself; but it is this particular
        thing which comes to be or is generated in itself. And the reason is
        that everything which comes to be comes to be from matter. Hence, since
        this particular thing is composed of matter and form, it comes to be or
        is generated “from these principles,” i.e., from its material and
        individuating principles. But it was stated above (71I:C 1714) that a
        form is not an element or anything composed of the elements. Therefore
        it follows that a form neither comes to he nor is generated in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        1717.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But whether the substances</span> (713).
      </p>
      <p>
        He examines the fourth point given above, namely, Plato’s position that
        forms are separate from matter. In regard to this he does three things.
        First, he exposes what the problem is in this position, saying that it
        is not clear whether “the substances,” i.e., the forms, of corruptible
        things are separable as the Platonists claimed.
      </p>
      <p>1718. It is evident, however (714).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he indicates what seems to be evident on this point. He says
        that it is evident that the forms of some corruptible things are not
        separate, namely, “all those” which are incapable of existing apart from
        their matters, as house or vessel, because neither the form of a house
        nor that of a vessel can exist apart from its proper matter.
      </p>
      <p>1719. <span style="font-weight: bold">Indeed, perhaps</span> (715).</p>
      <p>
        Third, he precludes an objection, saying that perhaps the forms of
        artifacts are not substances or anything in their own right, and so
        cannot have separate existence. Nor similarly can other artificial
        forms, which have no natural existence, because in artifacts the matter
        alone is held to be substance, whereas the forms of artifacts are
        accidents. Natural forms, however, belong to the class of substance; and
        this is why Plato did not hold that the forms of artifacts exist apart
        from matter but only substantial forms.
      </p>
      <p>1720. <span style="font-weight: bold">For this reason</span> (716).</p>
      <p>
        He advances arguments that are clearly opposed to Plato’s position. He
        says that if one holds that there are separate forms, as the Platonists
        maintained, the problem which the followers of Antisthenes raised, even
        though they seem to be uninstructed, may be used against the Platonists.
        For they argued that it is impossible to define a thing by means of a
        definition which signifies its quiddity, since a thing’s quiddity is
        simple and is not fittingly expressed by a statement composed of many
        parts. For we see that “the limit,” or definition, which is given to a
        thing, is a lengthy statement made up of many words. Therefore it does
        not signify what a thing is but “what it is like,” i.e., something to
        which it is similar; as if one were to say that the definition of silver
        does not signify silver but signifies something like lead or tin.
      </p>
      <p>
        1721. Hence in order to solve this problem we must say that the
        substance which is defined, whether it be intellectual or sensible, must
        be one that is composite. But since the primary parts of which a
        definition is composed are simple, they are incapable of definition. For
        it was stated above (706:C 1700) that the definitive statement joins one
        part to another, one of which is as form and the other as matter,
        because genus is derived from matter and difference from form, as was
        pointed out above (704:C 1696-8). Hence, if the species of things were
        forms only, as the Platonists held, they would be indefinable.
      </p>
      <p>
        1722.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, it is also clear</span> (717).
      </p>
      <p>
        Having determined what is true of forms in relation to the Ideas
        introduced by Plato, Aristotle now ‘determines what is true of forms in
        relation to numbers. For Plato held that numbers are the forms and
        substances of things by establishing a kind of likeness between forms
        and numbers. This is divided into four parts inasmuch as there are four
        ways in which he likens forms to numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, he says that, if numbers are in any sense the substances or forms
        of things, it is evident that they are such in this way, as can be
        understood from the foregoing, but not as numbers of units as the
        Platonists said. Now a number of units is called a simple and absolute
        number [i.e., an ab9tract number], but the number applied to things is
        called a concrete number, as four dogs or four men; and in this way the
        substances of things, which are Signified by a definition, can be called
        numbers. For a definition is divisible into two parts, one of which is
        as form and the other as matter, as was pointed out above (706:C 1700).
        And it is divisible into indivisible parts; for since definitions cannot
        proceed to infinity, the division of a definition must terminate in
        certain indivisible parts. For example, if the definition of man is
        divided into animal and rational, and the definition of animal into
        animated and sensible, this will not go on to infinity. For it is
        impossible to have an infinite regress in material and formal causes, as
        was shown in Book II (152:C 299). Hence he explains that the division of
        a definition is not like the division of a continuous quantity, which is
        divisible to infinity, but is like the division of a number, which is
        divisible into indivisible parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        1723. <span style="font-weight: bold">And just as when</span> (718).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the second way in which the substance that the definition
        signifies is like number. He says that, if anything is added to or
        subtracted from any number, even if it is a bare minimum, the resulting
        number will not be specifically the same. For in the case of numbers the
        minimum is the number one, which, when added to the number three, gives
        rise to the number four, which is a specifically different number; but
        if it is subtracted from the same number, the number two remains, which
        is also a specifically different number. And this is true because the
        ultimate difference gives to a number its species.
      </p>
      <p>
        1724. And it is similar in the case of definitions and of the essence,
        which the definition signifies; because, howsoever small a part has been
        added or subtracted, there results another definition and another
        specific nature. For animated sensible substance alone is the definition
        of animal, but if you also add rational to this, you establish the
        species man. And in a similar way if you subtract sensible, you
        establish the species plant, because the ultimate difference also
        determines the species.
      </p>
      <p>
        1725. <span style="font-weight: bold">And there must be</span> (719).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the third way in which forms are like numbers. He says that a
        number is one thing. For a number is an essential unity inasmuch as the
        ultimate unity gives to a number its species and unity, just as in
        things composed of matter and form a thing is one and derives its unity
        and species from its form. And for this reason those who speak about the
        unity of a number as though a number were not essentially one cannot say
        what makes it to be one thing, i.e., if it is one. For since a number is
        composed of many units, either it is not one thing in an absolute sense
        but its units are joined together in the manner of a heap, which does
        not constitute a unity in an absolute sense, and therefore not a being
        in any class of things (and thus number would not be a class of being);
        or if it is one thing in an absolute sense and a being in itself, it is
        still necessary to explain what makes it one thing out of a plurality of
        units. But they are unable to assign a reason for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        1726. Similarly, a definition is one thing essentially, and thus they do
        not have to assign anything which makes it one. This is understandable,
        because the substance which the definition signifies is one thing for
        the very same reason that a number is, i.e., essentially, because one
        part of it is related to the other as form [to matter]. And it is one,
        not as being something indivisible such as a unit and a point, as some
        men claimed, but because each of them is one form and a kind of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        1727. <span style="font-weight: bold">And just as number</span> (720).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the fourth way in which forms are like numbers. He says that
        just as a number does not admit of (~) more or less, neither does
        substance in the sense of form, although perhaps substance in the sense
        of matter does admit of such difference. For just as the concept of
        number consists in some limit to which neither addition nor subtraction
        may be made, as has been pointed out (1723), so also does the concept of
        form.
      </p>
      <p>
        But things admit of (+) more or less because of the fact that matter
        participates in a form in a more or less perfect way. Hence too
        whiteness does not differ in terms of more or less, but a white thing
        does.
      </p>
      <p>

        He summarizes the points discussed. He says that he has dealt with “the
        generation and corruption of such substances,” or forms, both as to the
        way in which this is possible, namely, by reason of something else; and
        as to the way in which this is impossible, i.e., essentially; and also
        with the likeness which forms have to numbers, i.e., by reducing them to
        numbers by way of a likeness.<br />

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapters 4 & 5: 1044a 15-1045a
      </p>
      <p>
        722. Concerning material substance we must not remain ignorant of the
        fact that, even though all things come from the same first [principle]
        or from the same [principles] or first [causes], and even though the
        same matter is the first principle of things which come to be, still
        there is some proper matter of each thing; for example, the first matter
        of phlegm is the sweet or the fat, but of bile the bitter or something
        else. But perhaps these come from the same matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        723. Further, there are several matters of the same thing when one comes
        from another, as phlegm comes from the fat and the sweet, if the fat
        comes from the sweet. And something comes from bile by dissolving bile
        into its first matter. For one thing comes from another in two ways:
        either because it is prior to the other [in the process of development]
        or because it comes from the dissolving of a thing into its first
        principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        724. Now when there is one matter it is possible for different things to
        come into being by virtue of the cause of motion, as a chest and a bed
        come from wood. But of certain things the matter is necessarily
        different when the things are different; e.g., a saw cannot be made from
        wood, and it is not within the power of the cause of motion to do this;
        for he is incapable of making a saw from wool or from wood. But if the
        same thing can be made from different matters, it is clear that the art
        and the principle which acts as a mover are the same. For if both the
        matter and the cause of motion are different, so also will be the thing
        that is made.
      </p>
      <p>
        725. Hence, when one asks what the cause of anything is, it is necessary
        to mention all the causes concerned, since causes are spoken of in
        several senses. For example, What is a man’s material cause? The
        menstrual fluid. What is his moving cause? The seed. What is his formal
        cause? His essence. What is his final cause? His end. But perhaps both
        of these are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        726. It is necessary also to give the proximate causes. What is the
        matter of man? Not earth or fire, but his proper matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        727. Indeed, concerning natural substances which are generable it is
        necessary to proceed in this way, if one is to proceed correctly,
        granted that these are the causes, that they are of this number, and
        that it is necessary to know the causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        728. In the case of natural substances which are eternal there is
        another procedure. Perhaps some of them do not have matter or do not
        have this kind of matter but only that which is subjected to change of
        place.
      </p>
      <p>
        729. Thus all those things which are by nature but are not substances do
        not have matter, but the underlying subject is their substance. For
        example, What is the matter of an eclipse? There is none, but it is the
        moon that is the patient. What is the efficient cause destroying the
        light? The earth. What is the final cause? Perhaps there is none. What
        is the formal cause? The definition. But this will not be clear if it
        does not include the [efficient] cause. For example, What is an eclipse?
        A privation of light. And if one adds, as a result of the earth
        intervening, this definition is one which includes the [efficient]
        cause. However, in the case of sleep it is not clear what the primary
        subject is, although it is clear that the animal is also a primary
        subject. But it is such in a qualified sense. And what is the primary
        subject, the heart or some other part? Then, by what [is this
        modification produced]? And what is this modification which pertains to
        that [part] and not to the whole? Is this a special kind of immobility?
        It is, but it belongs [to the animal] by reason of some primary subject.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">Chapter 5</p>
      <p>
        730. But since some things are and are not, without generation and
        corruption, such as points, if they do in fact exist, and in general the
        forms and specifying principles of things, then all contraries do not
        come from each other. For whiteness does not come to be but white wood
        does; and everything which comes to be comes from something and becomes
        something. And white man comes from black man and white from black in
        different ways. Nor do all things have matter but only those which may
        be generated and changed into each other. There is no matter in those
        things which are and are not without undergoing change.
      </p>
      <p>
        731. Again, there is the problem how the matter of each thing is related
        to contraries. For example, if the body is potentially healthy and the
        opposite of health is disease, is the body potentially both? And is
        water potentially wine and vinegar? Or is it related to one as matter to
        its form or actuality, and to the other as the privation and natural
        corruption [of its form or actuality] ?
      </p>
      <p>
        732. Now this raises the problem why wine is not the matter of vinegar,
        even though vinegar comes from it, and why the living is not the
        potentially dead; or whether this is not the case, but the corruptions
        of these occur in virtue of something else. As a matter of fact the
        matter of a living body is by corruption the potency and matter of a
        dead body, and water is the matter of vinegar; for they come from each
        other as night comes from day. Hence whatever things are changed into
        each other in this way must return to their matter. For example, if a
        living body is to come from a dead one [the latter must return] to its
        first matter, and then a living body comes into being. And vinegar [must
        return] to water, and then wine comes into being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1729. Having treated those points which had to be considered about the
        formal principle of substance, Aristotle now establishes what is true
        regarding the material principle. This is divided into three parts.
        First (7:22:C 1729), he deals with the material principle in relation to
        the things which come from matter; second (724:C 1733), in relation to
        the other causes (“Now when there is one matter”); and third (730:C
        1746), in relation to the change of generation and corruption, whose
        subject is matter (“But since some things”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First (722), he shows whether
        there is one or several kinds of matter that there are several matters
        of the for all things. And in regard to the material principle he says
        that one must not remain ignorant of the fact that, even though all
        things come from the same first material principle, namely, first
        matter, which has no form of its own, or from the same material
        principles “or first [causes],” (which is added because of the four
        elements, the material principles common to all generable and
        corruptible things), and even though the same matter is “the first
        principle of things which come to be,” (which he adds because of the
        fact that matter is not only a principle of being but also of
        coming-to-be), i.e., even though first matter and the elements are
        universally related to things composed of the elements, there is still
        some proper matter of each thing. For example, the proper matter of
        phlegm (not in an absolute sense but generically) is the fat and the
        sweet, since these have a certain relationship to phlegm by reason of
        their moistness. But the first matter of bile is bitter things or
        certain others of this kind; for in bitter things heat seems to have
        absolute dominion over moistness even to the extent of destroying it.
        Thus by reason of dryness and warmth the bitter has a relationship to
        bile. But perhaps these two matters, namely, the bitter and the sweet,
        come from some prior material principle. He adds “perhaps” because
        certain things have different matters, since their matters are not
        reducible to any prior matter, for example corruptible and incorruptible
        bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        1730. From the things which are said here then it is evident that there
        is one first matter for all generable and corruptible things, but
        different proper matters for different things.
      </p>
      <p>
        1731.
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >Further, there are several matters</span
        >
        (723).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he points out how in an opposite sense there are several matters
        for one and the same thing. He says that there are several matters of
        the same thing when one of these is the matter of another, as the matter
        of phlegm is the fat and the sweet, if the fat comes from the sweet. For
        the savor of fat is reckoned among the intermediate savors, and these
        are produced from extremes, which are the sweet and the bitter. But the
        fat is nearest to the sweet. Now in these examples we must bear in mind
        that he takes as the matter of each thing that from which the thing
        comes to be, even though it is not permanent but transitory.
      </p>
      <p>
        1732. Therefore, lest someone should think that a thing is always said
        to come from a material principle, and not the reverse, he adds that
        something is also said to come from bile by the dissolution of bile into
        its first matter, and in reverse order bile is said to come from first
        matter. For one thing is said to come from another in two ways: either
        because the thing from which it comes is naturally its starting point in
        the process of generation (for this kind of thing is a material
        principle); or because the process of coming-to-be is the dissolving of
        a thing into its material principle, namely, in the sense that a
        material principle is said to come from a composite by dissolution. For
        a mixed body comes from the elements by the process of composition,
        whereas the elements come from a mixed body by the process of
        dissolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        1733.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Now when there is one matter</span>
        (724).
      </p>
      <p>
        He establishes what is true of matter in relation to the other causes.
        First, in relation to the agent cause alone, which produces something
        from matter; and this relationship pertains to matter according as it is
        a principle of coming-to-be. Second (725:C 1737), in relation to all the
        causes, according as matter constitutes a principle of knowing (“Hence,
        when one asks”).
      </p>
      <p>
        But since he had said above (722:C 1729) that there was one first matter
        of all things, one can inquire how a diversity of things could come from
        one common matter. For the ancient Philosophers of nature attributed
        this to chance when they disregarded the agent cause and claimed that
        the diversity of things comes from one matter by a process of
        rarefaction and condensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        1734. Therefore in rejecting this the Philosopher says, first (724),
        that when there is one matter it is possible for different things to
        come into being by reason of the cause of motion, either because there
        are different causes of motion, or because one and the same cause of
        motion is disposed in a different way for producing different effects.
        This is most evident in the case of things made by art. For we see that
        a chest and a bed are made from wood by one craftsman in virtue of the
        different art-forms which he himself possesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        1735. But even though there is a first matter common to all things,
        nevertheless the proper matters of different things are different.
        Therefore, lest someone should attribute the diversity of things in
        their entirety to the cause of motion and in no way to the material
        principle, he adds that in some of the things that are different the
        matter is necessarily different, namely, the proper matter. For not
        anything at all is naturally disposed to come into being from any
        matter, as a saw does not come from wood. Nor is it within the power of
        the craftsman to bring this about; for he never assigns one matter to
        each work, because he is unable to make a saw either from wood or from
        wool, which, on account of their softness, are not suitable for the work
        of a saw, which is to cut.
      </p>
      <p>
        1736. It is evident, then, that the diversity of things is a result of
        the efficient cause and of matter. Hence, if it is fitting that
        something specifically the same should be produced from a different
        matter, as a bowl from gold and from silver, it is obvious that the
        efficient principle, i.e., the art, must be the same. For if both the
        matter and the cause of motion were different, the thing produced would
        have to be different.
      </p>
      <p>
        1737. Hence, when one asks (725). He deals with matter in relation to
        the other causes according as matter is a principle of knowing. In
        regard to this he does two things. First (725), he shows that in the
        case of generable and corruptible things we must assign matter along
        with the other causes. Second (728:C 1740), he shows how matter is found
        in natural substances which are eternal (“In the case of natural
        substances”). Third (729:C 1743), he explains how matter is ascribed to
        accidents (“Thus all those things”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. For, first (725), since the
        ancient philosophers of nature assigned only the material cause, he says
        that when one asks what the cause of anything is, it is necessary to
        state all the causes “concerned,” i.e., all which contribute to the
        being of the thing in question, since causes are spoken of in several
        senses. For not all things have all the causes, although natural beings,
        and especially generable and corruptible ones, have all the causes. For
        example, in the generation of man his material cause is the menstrual
        fluid; his active cause is the seed, in which the active power is
        contained; his formal cause is his essence, which is signified by the
        definition; and his final cause is his end [or goal]. But perhaps these
        two causes, namely, the end and the form, are numerically the same. He
        says this because in some things they are the same and in some not. For
        the goal of a man’s generation is his soul, whereas the goal of his
        operations is happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        1738. <span style="font-weight: bold">It is necessary also</span> (726).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he shows that it is not only necessary to assign all the causes
        but also to state the proximate causes, so that by beginning with the
        first causes we may reach the proximate ones. For the knowledge had of a
        thing through first causes is only a general and incomplete knowledge,
        whereas that had of a thing through proximate causes is a complete
        knowledge. For example, if one asks about the material cause of man, one
        should not assign as his cause fire or earth, which are the common
        matter of all generable and corruptible things, but should state his
        proper matter, such as flesh and bones and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
        1739.
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >Indeed, concerning natural substances</span
        >
        (727).
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, he summarizes the foregoing. He says that it is necessary to
        proceed thus in regard to natural and generable substances if one is to
        consider the causes correctly, giving all the causes including the
        proximate ones. This is necessary in view of the fact that the causes
        are of this number, as has been explained (725:C 1737). And it is
        necessary to grasp the causes of a thing in order that it may be known
        scientifically, because science is a knowledge of the cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        1740.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">In the case of natural substances</span>
        (728).
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows how there is matter in natural substances which are eternal,
        namely, in the celestial bodies. He says that the matter in natural
        substances which are eternal, namely, in the celestial bodies, is not
        the same as that in bodies subject to generation and corruption. For
        perhaps such substances do not have matter, or if they do have matter,
        they do not have the sort that generable and corruptible bodies have,
        but only that which is subjected to local motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        1741. For, as was said above (725:C 1737), in the case of generable and
        corruptible things generation and corruption bring us to a knowledge of
        matter; because in the process of generation and corruption there must
        be one subject common to both privation and form. Hence, since in a
        celestial body there is no potentiality for privation of form but only
        for different places, it does not have a matter which is in potentiality
        to form and privation but one which is in potentiality to different
        places.
      </p>
      <p>
        1742. However, a body is related to place not as matter to form but
        rather as subject to accident. And although in one respect a subject is
        related to an accident as matter is to form, still a subject is not to
        be identified with matter, as is stated below (729:C 1743). Thus a
        celestial body as such does not have matter in any way, if subject does
        not imply matter; or it has matter as regards place, if subject implies
        matter.
      </p>
      <p><i>Matter</i></p>
      <p>1743. <span style="font-weight: bold">Thus all those</span> (729).</p>
      <p>
        He shows how matter is ascribed to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">accidents</span>. He says that those
        things which exist by nature yet are not substances but accidents, (~)
        do not have a <span style="font-weight: bold">matter</span> from which
        they come to be, but (+) they have a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">subject</span>, which is the substance.
        Now a subject bears some likeness to matter inasmuch as it is receptive
        of an accident. But it differs from matter in this respect, that while
        matter has actual being only through form, a subject is not constituted
        in being by an accident.
      </p>
      <p>
        1744. Therefore, if one asks what is the cause of an eclipse, one cannot
        give its (~) <span style="font-weight: bold">matter</span>, but the moon
        is the (+) subject undergoing this modification.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the <span style="font-weight: bold">efficient</span> cause which
        extinguishes the light is the earth placed directly between the sun and
        the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
        But perhaps it is impossible to give the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">final</span> cause; for those things
        which pertain to <span style="font-weight: bold">defect</span> do not
        exist because of some end but are rather a result of natural necessity
        or of the necessity of the efficient cause. However, he says “perhaps”
        because an investigation of the causes of particular events which take
        place in celestial movements is especially difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the <span style="font-weight: bold">formal</span> cause of an
        eclipse is its definition. But this definition is not clear unless the
        [efficient] cause is given therein. Thus the definition of a lunar
        eclipse is the privation of light in the moon. But if one adds that this
        privation is caused by the earth being placed directly between the sun
        and the moon, this definition will contain the [efficient] cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        1745. This is evident also in regard to the accident sleep. But in the
        case of sleep it is not clear what the primary subject is that undergoes
        this modification, although it is clear that the animal is the subject
        of sleep. However, it is not clear to what part of the animal sleep
        primarily belongs-whether to the heart or some other part; for some men
        hold that the primary organ of sensation is the brain and some the
        heart. However, sleep is the cessation of sensory operation. Then,
        having come to an agreement on the subject of sleep, it is necessary to
        consider from what, as its efficient cause, sleep comes—whether from the
        evaporation of food or physical labor or something of this kind. Next we
        must consider what modification sleep is, [defining] its primary
        subject, which will be some part of the animal and not the whole animal.
        For sleep is a kind of immobility. But it belongs primarily to an animal
        by reason of some part which is the subject of such a modification. Now
        in the definition of sleep we must state this primary subject, just as
        in the definition of every accident we must state its primary and proper
        subject. For color is defined by surface but not by body.
      </p>
      <p>
        1746.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But since some things</span> (730).
      </p>
      <p>
        He deals with matter in relation to the process whereby one thing is
        changed into something else. Therefore, first (730), he shows how change
        comes about in different ways in different things. Second (731:C 1748),
        he proposes certain problems (“Again, there is the problem”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first (730), that certain things sometimes are and sometimes
        are not but “without generation and corruption,” i.e., without being
        gencrated and corrupted in themselves, for example, points and all
        specifying principles and forms generally, whether substantial or
        accidental. For properly speaking, white does not come to be, but white
        wood does; for everything which comes to be comes “from something,”
        i.e., from matter, and comes to be that in which the process of coming
        to be is terminated, which is form. Thus everything which comes to be is
        composed of matter and form. Hence those things which are forms only
        cannot come to be in themselves. Therefore, when it is said that
        contraries come to be from each other, this has one meaning in the case
        of composite things and another in the case of simple things. For white
        man comes from black man in a different way than white from black,
        because white man signifies a composite and can therefore come to be in
        itself. But white signifies a form only, and therefore it comes to be
        from black only by reason of something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        1747. From the above, then, it is clear that matter does not exist in
        everything but only in those things which are generated or transformed
        essentially into each other. However, those things which sometimes are
        and sometimes are not, without being changed essentially, are such that
        their matter is not that from which they come, but they have as their
        matter the subject in which they exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        1748.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, there is the problem</span>
        (731).
      </p>
      <p>
        He raises two questions in regard to the above. The first of these
        pertains to the way in which matter is related to contraries, namely,
        whether in all things which seem to have contrariety or opposition
        matter is in potentiality to each contrary equally and in the same
        order. For health is a certain equality of humors, whereas disease is
        their inequality. But both inequality and equality are related to their
        subject in the same order. Therefore it seems that water, which is the
        matter of humors, is in potentiality to wine and vinegar as contraries,
        and is disposed equally to both.
      </p>
      <p>
        1749. But in solving this problem the Philosopher says that this is not
        true. For the form of wine is a certain positive state and nature,
        whereas the form of vinegar is the privation and corruption of wine.
        Hence matter is disposed first to wine as a positive state and form, but
        to vinegar as the privation and corruption of wine. And thus it is
        related to vinegar only through the medium of wine.
      </p>
      <p>
        1750.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Now this raises the problem</span>
        (732).
      </p>
      <p>
        He proposes a second problem, which is as follows. That from which a
        thing comes to be seems to be the matter of that thing; for example,
        mixed bodies come to be from the elements, which constitute their
        matter. Therefore, since vinegar comes from wine and a dead body from a
        living one, the problem arises why wine is not the matter of vinegar and
        a living body the matter of a dead one, since one is related to the
        other as potentiality is to actuality.
      </p>
      <p>
        1751. But the answer to this is that vinegar is the corruption of wine
        itself, and a dead body the corruption of a living one. Hence vinegar
        does not come from wine as matter, or a dead body from a living one; but
        one is said to come from the other in virtue of something else inasmuch
        as it comes from its matter. Hence the matter of a bowl is not a goblet
        but silver. Similarly, a living body is not the matter of a dead body,
        but the elements are.
      </p>
      <p>
        1752. But because a dead body is said to come from a living one or
        vinegar from wine, this preposition from will signify order if reference
        is made to the form itself of wine or living body; for in the same
        matter after the form of wine there is vinegar, and after the form of a
        living body there is a dead one. An(] it is in this way that
      </p>
      <p>
        we say that night comes from day. Therefore, in all things that come
        from each other in this way, as vinegar from wine and a dead body from a
        living one, the process of change is reversed only when these things are
        dissolved into their matter. For example, if a living body must come
        from a dead one, the latter must first be dissolved into its primary
        matter inasmuch as a dead body is dissolved into the elements; and from
        the elements again in due order a living body is constituted. It is the
        same in regard to vinegar and wine.
      </p>
      <p>
        1753. The reason for this is that, whenever matter is disposed to
        different forms in a certain order, it cannot be brought back from a
        subsequent state to one that is prior in that order. For example, in the
        generation of an animal, blood comes from food; and the semen and
        menstrual fluid, from which the animal is generated, come from blood.
        But this order cannot be reversed so that blood comes from semen and
        food from blood, unless these are resolved into their first matter;
        because for each thing there is a definite mode of generation. And it is
        the same [in the other case], because the matter of wine is related to
        vinegar only through the medium of wine, namely, inasmuch as it is the
        corruption of wine. The same is also true of a dead body and a living
        one, of a blind man and one who has sight, and so on. Therefore from
        such privations there can be a return to a prior form only when such
        things are dissolved into first matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1754. However, if there is some privation to which matter is immediately
        disposed, and this signifies nothing else than the non-existence of form
        in matter which lacks a disposition for form, then the process of
        reverting from such a privation to a [prior] form, as from darkness to
        illumination, will be possible because this [i.e., darkness] is nothing
        else than the absence of light in the transparent medium.<br />

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 6: 1045a 7-1045b 23
      </p>
      <p>
        733. It seems that we must discuss next the problem which was mentioned
        with regard to definitions and numbers: what it is that causes them to
        be one. For all things which have several parts, and of which the whole
        is not a kind of heap but is something over and above the parts, have
        some cause that makes them one. For in some bodies contact is the cause
        of their unity, and in others stickiness or some other such quality. But
        a definition is one intelligible structure not by the connection of its
        parts, like the <i>Iliad</i>, but by being one thing. What is it, then,
        that makes man to be one; and why is he one thing and not many, for
        example, animal and two-footed?
      </p>
      <p>
        734. And if, in a different way, as some claim, there is an
        animal-itself and a two-footed-itself, why is man not these two things?
        And if this were the case, men would not be such by participating in
        man, i.e., by participating in one thing, but in two, namely, in animal
        and two-footed. Hence in general man will not be one thing but many,
        i.e., animal and two-footed.
      </p>
      <p>
        735. It is evident, then, that those who accept this position and
        discuss and define things in the way they have been accustomed to do,
        cannot find an answer or solution to this problem. But if (as we say)
        one part is as matter and the other as form, or one is in potency and
        the other in act, the problem with which we are dealing will no longer
        appear to be a difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
        736. For this problem is just the same as we should have if the
        definition of cloak were round bronze. Now let us suppose that this term
        is the sign of this definition. Then when one asks what causes round and
        bronze to be one thing, there will no longer be a problem, because one
        is as matter and the other as form. What is it, then, apart from the
        efficient cause, that causes the potential to become actual in the case
        of things which are generated? For there is no other cause of the
        potential sphere being an actual sphere; but this was the essence of
        each.
      </p>
      <p>
        737. Further, some matter is intelligible and some sensible. And one
        part of a definition is always as matter and the other as actuality; for
        example, a circle is a plane figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        738. But each of those things which do not have matter, either
        intelligible or sensible, is at once one thing, just as it is a being: a
        particular thing, a quality, or a quantity; and for this reason neither
        being nor unity is expressed in their definitions. And their essence is
        at once one thing just as it is also a being. For this reason there is
        not some other cause of each of these being one or of being something;
        for each is at once a being and a unity, not as belonging to the class
        of being or unity, nor because these distinctions exist separately from
        singular things.
      </p>
      <p>
        739. And it is because of this difficulty that some men speak of
        participation, and raise the question as to what causes participation
        and what it is to participate. For some speak of the coexistence of the
        soul, as Lycophron, who says that knowledge is the coexistence of the
        act of knowing and the soul; and others say that life is the composition
        or connection of soul with body.
      </p>
      <p>
        740. The same argument applies in all cases. For being healthy will be
        either the coexistence or conjunction or composition of soul and health;
        and being a bronze triangle will be the composition of bronze and
        triangle; and being white will be the composition of surface and
        whiteness.
      </p>
      <p>
        741. Now the reason for this position is that these thinkers are looking
        for some unifying principle and difference of potentiality and
        actuality. But, as we have pointed out (736), both the ultimate matter
        and form are the same, one potentially and the other actually. Hence to
        ask what the cause of their unity is, is the same as to ask what makes
        them one; for each particular thing is a unity, and what is potential
        and what is actual are in a sense one thing. Hence there is no other
        cause except that which causes motion from potentiality to actuality.
        And all those things which do not have matter are simply one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        1755. Having dealt with the material and formal principles, Aristotle
        now intends to settle the question about the way in which they are
        united to each other; and in regard to this he does three things. First
        (733:C 1755), he raises the question. Second (735:C 1758), he answers it
        (“It is evident”). Third (739:C 1765), he rejects the false opinions
        about this question (“And it is because”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first, he gives two reasons for saying that this
        question involves a difficulty. He says (733) that, in regard to the
        question which was touched on above about definitions and numbers as to
        what makes each of them one, it must be noted that all things which have
        several parts (and of which the whole is not merely a heap of parts but
        is something constituted of parts and is over and above the parts
        themselves) have something that makes them one. For in some bodies which
        have unity in this way, contact is the cause of their unity, and in
        others stickiness or something else of this kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        1756. Now it is evident that, while a defining concept is one thing
        composed of many parts, it is not one thing merely by the addition of
        its parts, “like the <i>Iliad</i>,” i.e., the poem written about the
        history of the Trojans, which is one thing only by way of aggregation.
        But a definition is one thing in an absolute sense, for it signifies one
        thing. It is reasonable, then, to ask what makes both the definition of
        man to be one thing, and man himself, whose intelligible structure is
        the definition. For since man is animal and two-footed, and these seem
        to be two things, it is reasonable to ask why man is one thing and not
        many.
      </p>
      <p>
        1757.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">And if, in a different way</span> (734).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the reason why this question is a problem. For if what
        some men claim is true, i.e., if animal itself is a particular thing
        which exists of itself and is separate, and the same
      </p>
      <p>
        is true of two-footed, as the Platonists held, then it is reasonable to
        ask why man is not these two things connected together, so that
        particular men are such only by participating in man, and not by
        participating in one thing but in two, animal and two-footed. And
        according to this man will not be one thing but two, namely, animal and
        two-footed.
      </p>
      <p>1758. It is evident (735).</p>
      <p>
        He solves the above problem; and in regard to this he does two things.
        First, he offers an explanation that seems to provide a solution to the
        problem. He says that, if some men accept the things which have been
        said about Plato’s position, and change the natures of things in this
        way because they hold that universals are separate as the Platonists
        were accustomed to define and speak of them, it will evidently be
        impossible to give the cause of a man’s unity or solve the foregoing
        problem. But if, as is stated above (706:C 1700), one holds that in
        definitions one part is as matter and the other as form, i.e., one as
        potentiality and the other as actuality, then it will be easy to solve
        the question, because there does not seem to be a problem.
      </p>
      <p>1759. For this problem (736).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he solves this problem in the aforesaid way. First, he solves it
        in the case of natural substances which are generated and corrupted. He
        says that this problem would be the same as if we were to ask why bronze
        is round. For let us assume that the definition of the term cloak is
        round bronze, and that this term signifies this definition. Then when
        one asks why the definition round bronze is one, there does not seem to
        be any problem, because bronze is as matter and round as form. For there
        is no other cause of these being one except that which makes what is in
        potency to become actual. And in everything in which there is generation
        this is the agent. Hence, since this (what is in potentiality to become
        actual) is the essence signified by the definition, then in the case of
        things subject to generation and corruption it is evidently the agent
        which causes the definition of the essence to be one.
      </p>
      <p>
        1760. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, some matter</span> (737).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he solves the above problem in regard to the objects of
        <i>mathematics</i>. He says that matter is of two kinds, sensible and
        intelligible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sensible matter is what pertains to the sensible qualities, hot and
        cold, rare and dense and the like; and with this matter natural bodies
        are concreted. Now the objects of mathematics abstract from this kind of
        matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        But intelligible matter means what is understood without sensible
        qualities or differences, for example, what is continuous. And the
        objects of mathematics do not abstract from this kind of matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        1761. Hence, whether in the case of sensible things or in that of the
        objects of mathematics, their definitions must always contain something
        as matter and something as form; for example, in the definition of a
        mathematical circle, a circle is a plane figure,
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >plane is as matter and figure as form</span
        >. For a mathematical definition and a natural definition are each one
        thing on the same grounds (even though there is no agent in the realm of
        mathematical entities as there is in the realm of natural entities),
        because in both cases one part of the definition is as matter and the
        other as form.
      </p>
      <p>
        1762. He solves the above problem in regard to the things that are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">wholly separate from matter</span>. He
        says that in the case of all those things which do not have intelligible
        matter, as the objects of mathematics have, or sensible matter, as
        natural bodies have, that is to say, in the case of the separate
        substances, each one of these is at once one thing [individuated by
        form].
      </p>
      <p>
        For each of those things which have matter is not at once one thing, but
        they are one because unity comes to their matter. But if there is
        anything that is only a form, it is at once one thing, because it is
        impossible to posit in it anything prior in any order whatever that must
        await unity from a form.
      </p>
      <p>
        1763. He gives this example: the ten categories do not derive being by
        adding something to being in the way that species are established by
        adding differences to genera, but each is itself a being. And since this
        is true, it is evident that being does not await something to be added
        to it so that it may become one of these, i.e., either a substance or
        quantity or quality; but each of these from the very beginning is at
        once either a substance or quantity or quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the reason why neither unity nor being is given as a genus in
        definitions, because unity and being would have to be related as matter
        to differences, through the addition of which being would become either
        substance or quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        1764. Similarly, that which is wholly separate from matter and is its
        own essence, as was stated above (1708), is at once one thing, just as
        it is a being; for it contains no matter that awaits a form from which
        it will derive being and unity. In the case of such things, then, there
        is no cause that makes them one by means of motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, some of them have a cause which supports their substances
        without their substances being moved [separate simple substances depend
        on God for existence], and not as in the case of things subject to
        generation, which come to be through motion. For each of them is at once
        a particular being and a one, but not so that being and unity are
        certain genera or that they exist as individuals apart from singular
        things, as the Platonists held.
      </p>
      <p>
        1765. <span style="font-weight: bold">And it is because</span> (739).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he rejects the false opinion which some men held about this
        question; and in regard to this he. does three things.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, he states their position. He says that it is because of this
        problem that some, namely, the Platonists, posited participation, by
        which inferior beings participate in superior ones; for example, this
        particular man participates in man, and man in animal and two-footed.
        And they asked what the cause of participation is and what it is to
        participate, in order that it might become clear to them why this thing
        which I call two-footed animal is one thing. And others held that the
        cause of a man’s unity is a certain consubstantiality or coexistence of
        the soul with the body, as if soul’s being with body were signified in
        the abstract; as if we were to speak of animation as Lycophron said that
        knowledge is a mean between the soul and the act of knowing; and others
        said that life itself is the mean whereby soul is joined to body.

      <p>1766. The same argument (740).</p>
      <p>
        He rejects these positions. He says that if the statement made about the
        soul and the body is correct, i.e., that there is some mean uniting
        them, the same argument will apply in all things which are related as
        form and matter. For, according to this, being healthy will be a mean as
        a kind of consubstantiality or a kind of connection or bond between the
        soul, by which the animal subsists, and health. And being a triangle
        will be a mean combining figure and triangle. And being white will be a
        mean by which whiteness is connected with surface. This is obviously
        false. Hence it will be false that animation is a mean by which the soul
        is joined to the body, since animation means merely being ensouled.

      <p>1767. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now the reason</span> (740).</p>
      <p>
        He gives the reasons for the error in the above positions. He says that
        the reason why these thinkers held such views is that they sought for
        some principle which makes potentiality and actuality one thing, and
        looked for the differences of these as though it were necessary for them
        to be brought together by some one mean like things which are actual and
        diverse. But, as has been stated, both the ultimate matter, which is
        appropriated to a form, and the form itself are the same; for one of
        them is as potentiality and the other as actuality. Hence to ask what
        causes a thing is the same as to ask what causes it to be one, because
        each thing is one to the extent that it is a being. And potentiality and
        actuality are also one in a certain respect, for it is the potential
        that becomes actual; and thus it is not necessary for them to be united
        by some bond like those things which are completely different. Hence
        there is no other cause that produces the unity of things which are
        composed of matter and form except that cause which moves things from
        potentiality to actuality. But those things which simply do not have
        matter are some one thing of themselves just as they are something
        existing. These explanations will suffice for Book VIII.
