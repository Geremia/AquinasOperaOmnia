<p align=center><B>LECTURE I
<BLOCKQUOTE><p>1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with
his disciples across the Kidron valley [brook], where there was a garden, which
he and his disciples entered. 2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the
place; for Jesus often met there with his disciples. 3 So Judas, procuring a
band of soldiers and some officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees,
went there with lanterns and torches and weapons. 4 Then Jesus, knowing all
that was to befall him, came forward and said to them, "Whom do you seek?" 5
They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth. "Jesus said to them, I am he." Judas,
who betrayed him, was standing with them. 6 When he said to them, "I am he,"
they drew back and fell to the ground. 7 Again he asked them, "Whom do you
seek?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth." 8 Jesus answered, "I told you that I
am he; so, if you seek me, let these men go." 9 This was to fulfill the word
which he had spoken, "Of those whom you gave me I lost not one."<a href="John18.htm#_ftn1"

<p>2271 Before his passion, as we saw above, our Lord prepared
his disciples in many ways: teaching them by his example, comforting them with
his words, and aiding them by his prayers. Now the Evangelist begins the
history of the passion: first, he sets forth the mystery of the passion; secondly,
the glory of the resurrection (20:1).

<pIndent>Christ's passion was effected partly by the Jews,
and partly by the Gentiles. Thus, he first describes what Christ suffered from
the Jews; secondly, what he suffered from the Gentiles (19:1). He does three things
regarding the first: he shows how our Lord was betrayed by a disciple;
secondly, how he was brought before the high priests (v 13); and thirdly, how
he was accused before Pilate (v 28).

<p>In regard to Christ's betrayal, the
Evangelist mentions three things: first, the place; secondly, the procedure;
and thirdly, the willingness of Christ to submit to the betrayal (v 4). The
place of the betrayal was shown to be appropriate in three ways: because it was
outside the city; it was private and enclosed; and it was known to the traitor.

<p>2272 The place of the betrayal was some distance from the
city, and so Judas could more easily do what he intended. The Evangelist says, <b>When
Jesus had spoken these words, </b>the words we have read above. But since what
Christ said belonged to his prayer, it would seem more appropriate for the
Evangelist to say, "When Jesus had prayed." The Evangelist put it the way he
did to show that Christ did not pray because of any need of his own, since he
was the one who, as man, prayed, and who, as God, heard the prayer. Rather,
Christ prayed in order to teach us. Thus this prayer is described as "spoken
words."

<p>2273 <b>He went forth with his disciples, </b>but not
immediately after this prayer, as Augustine notes.<a href="John18.htm#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>
Other things happened, omitted by this Evangelist, but mentioned by the others.
For example, there was an argument among the disciples about who was to be
regarded as the greatest (Lk 22:24); before setting out he said to Peter:
"Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have
prayed for you that your faith may not fail" (Lk 22:31); again, the disciples
recited a hymn with the Lord, as Matthew (26:30) and Mark (14:26) report. And
so we should not think that they went out immediately after the words of the
previous chapter, but that Christ said these things before they went out.

<p>2274 He went forth <b>across the Kidron brook. </b>Matthew
and Mark say that they went to the Mount of Olives, and then to a garden called
 Gethsemane. There is no conflict here, because all of them are referring to
the same place, for the Kidron brook is at the foot of the Mount of Olives,
where there was a garden called Gethsemane. In Greek, Kidron is genitive
plural; and so in effect he is saying a brook "of cedars." Perhaps there were
many cedar trees planted there.

<p>It is fitting for this mystery that
he cross a brook, because the brook indicates his passion: "He will drink from
the brook by the way; therefore he will lift up his head" (Ps 110:7). Again, it
is fitting that he cross the Kidron brook for Kidron is interpreted to mean an
overshadowing, and by his passion Christ removed the shadow of sin and of the
law, and stretching out his arms on the cross, he protected us under the shadow
of his arms: "Hide me in the shadow of your wings" (Ps 17:8).

<p>2275 The place was especially suitable for the betrayal. He
says, <b>there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. </b>This was
especially suitable because Christ was satisfying for the sin of our first
parent which had been committed in a garden (for paradise means a garden of
delights). It was also suitable because by his passion he is leading us into
another garden and paradise to receive a crown: "Today you will be with me in Paradise" (Lk 23:43).

<p>2276 It was also an appropriate place because it was known
to the traitor, <b>now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place; for Jesus
often met there with his disciples, </b>including Judas, who was like a wolf
among sheep: "Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
(6:71). This wolf in sheep's clothing, who had been tolerated among the sheep
according to the profound plan of the master, learned where he could scatter
the small flock when the time came.

<p>2277 Since Judas had left the supper a while before the
others, how did he know that Christ would later be in the garden? Chrysostom
says that it was Christ's custom, especially at the major feasts, to bring his
disciples there after supper and teach them the deeper meaning of the feasts,
things that others were not ready to hear.<a href="John18.htm#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title="">[3]</a>
And so, because this was an important feast, Judas surmised that Christ would
be going there after supper. It was Christ's custom to teach his disciples
these sublime matters in the mountains or in private gardens, seeking places
free from disturbance so they would not be distracted: "I will allure her, and
bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her" (Hos 2:14).

<p>2278 Now the Evangelist shows the procedure of the traitor.
Notice, as we see from Luke (22:4), that after Judas had agreed with the chief
priests to betray Christ, he looked for an opportunity to deliver him without
disturbing the people. Consequently, he wanted to come to him privately and at
night, because during the day Christ was always busy teaching the people. Yet
even at night it was possible that he be hindered by a quickly gathering crowd,
or by the darkness in which Christ could be spirited away or escape from their
hands. So against the crowd, he armed himself with weapons, and against the
darkness he brought lanterns and torches. And because some of the crowd might
resist, he took a band of soldiers, not from the Jews, but from the governor.
In this way, no one would dare to resist because they would see the marks of
legitimate authority. Further, some Jews might resist out of zeal for the law,
especially because Christ was being taken by Gentiles. For this reason Judas
took some servants or <b>officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees: </b>"He
has run against God with his head held high" [Job 15:26]; "Have you come out as
against a robber, with swords and clubs?" (Lk 22:52)

<p>2279 Now the Evangelist shows the promptness of Christ to
willingly undergo betrayal: first, by voluntarily offering himself; secondly,
by stopping one of the disciples who was resisting (v 10). In regard to the
first, the Evangelist does two things: first, he tells how Christ identified
himself to show his power; secondly, to show his patience (v 7). In regard to
the first he does three things: first, he states the question Christ asked;
secondly, he shows Christ identifying himself, <b>I am he</b>; thirdly, we see
the effect this has (v 6).

<p>2280 He does three things regarding the first. First, he
recalls Christ's knowledge: <b>Then Jesus, knowing all that was to befall him,
came forward</b>;<b> </b>"Jesus knew that his hour had come" (13:1). The
Evangelist mentions this for two reasons: first, so that it does not appear
that the question he is asking comes from his ignorance; and secondly, so that
it does not seem that he is offering himself unintentionally and without knowing
that they have come to kill him. He knew everything that would happen to him.

<p>Secondly, he states Christ's
question, for although he knew all these things he <b>came forward and said to
them, Whom do you seek? </b>But this was not because of his ignorance, as we said.
Thirdly, he gives their answer, <b>Jesus of Nazareth</b>. They were seeking him
not to imitate him, but to slander and kill him: "You will seek me and die in
your sin" (8:21).

<p>2281 Now we see Jesus identifying himself and offering
himself so that they can seize him. <b>I am he</b>, he says, that is, I am
Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are looking for. The Evangelist adds that Judas was
also there because he had mentioned before that Judas had left them (13:31). It
could be expected that they might not recognize the face of Christ because of
the darkness. But this darkness would not explain why they did not know Christ
from his voice, especially those who were quite familiar with him. By saying, <b>I
am he</b>, Christ shows that he was not recognized even by Judas who was with
them and on close terms with Christ. This in particular shows the power of
Christ's divinity. <b>Judas ... was standing with them</b>, that is, he
continued in his evil to the point of identifying him with a kiss.

<p>2282 Now we see the effect of his revealing himself:<b> they
drew back and fell to the ground. </b>As Gregory says, sometimes we read that
the saints fall to the ground: "The king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and
did homage to Daniel" (Dan 2:46); "When I saw it, I fell upon my face" (Ez
1:28).<a href="John18.htm#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>
We also read that the evil fall: "Your men shall fall by the sword" (Is 3:25).
Yet there is a difference. It is said that the evil fall backward: "Eli fell
over backward from his seat" (1 Sam 4:18); while the saints fall on their face.
The reason for this is given in Proverbs (4:18): "The path of the righteous is
like the light of dawn.... The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they
do not know over what they stumble." Now those who fall backward do not see
where they fall. And so those who are evil are said to fall backward because
they fall over things that are invisible. Those who fall forward see where they
are falling. Thus the saints, who willingly cast themselves down with respect
to visible things, so they can be raised up to invisible things, are said to
fall on their face because they humble themselves.

<p>Mystically understood, we can say
that by this falling backward we can understand that the Jewish people, who
were a special people, because they did not listen to the voice of Christ in
his preaching, fell backward, excluded from the kingdom.

<p>2283 Now we see Christ questioning them a second time. First
we see his question; secondly, he identifies himself; thirdly, he offers
himself to them.

<p>According to Chrysostom, there are
two reasons why Christ asks them a second time whom they were seeking.<a
href="John18.htm#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>
First, to teach the faithful that he was captured because he willed it: "He was
offered because it was his own will" [Is 53:7]; he had already shown his power
because when his enemies came against him, they fell backward to the ground
before him. Secondly, he wanted, as far as he could, to give the Jews a reason
to be converted, having seen this miracle of his power: "What more was there to
do for my vineyard, that I have not done it?" (Is 5:4). And when they were not
converted by the revelation of his power, he voluntarily offered himself to be
taken by them. When <b>Again he asked them, Whom do you seek? And they said,
Jesus of Nazareth, </b>he again identified himself and answered, <b>I told you
that I am he</b>. It is obvious from this that they were so blind that they
could not recognize him.

<p>He offers himself when he says, <b>if
you seek me</b>, to arrest me, then do what you want, but <b>let these men go</b>,
my disciples, for it is not yet their time to be taken from the world by suffering:
"I do not pray that you should take them out of the world" (17:15). It is clear
from this that Christ gave them the power to capture him, for just as he saved
his disciples by his own power, so, much more clearly, he could have saved
himself: "No one takes it [my life] from me, but I lay it down of my own
accord" (10:18).

<p>2284 The Evangelist shows that the officers allowed the
apostles to leave not because Christ persuaded them to do so, but because of
his power, when he says, <b>This was to fulfill the word which he had spoken. </b>The
officers let the apostles go because they were not able to hold them, since
Christ had said that <b>of those whom you gave me I lost not one</b>.

<p>2285 On the contrary. When our Lord said that none was lost,
he was referring to the soul. How can the Evangelist adapt this to refer to the
loss of the body? We may answer, according to Chrysostom, that our Lord was
speaking (17:12) of the loss of both the soul and the body.<a href="John18.htm#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>
And if he spoke only of the soul we could say that here the Evangelist extends
it to the loss of the body. Or, we could say, with Augustine, that we must
understand these words to refer here also to the loss of the soul.<a
href="John18.htm#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>
The reason being that the apostles did not yet believe in the way that those
who do not perish believe. And so, if they had left the world then, some would
have perished.

<p align=center><b>LECTURE 2

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>10 Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck
the high priest's slave and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was
Malchus. 11 Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not
drink the cup which the Father has given me?"</BLOCKQUOTE></b>

<p>2286 The Evangelist has shown how ready Christ was to suffer
his betrayal since he willingly offered himself. He now shows this same
readiness because Christ forbade a disciple to resist. First, he mentions the
resistance of the disciple; secondly, his being restrained (v 11). In regard to
the first he does two things: first, he shows the zeal of the disciple in
striking the servant; secondly, we see the name of the servant.

<p>2287 He says that the officers arrested Jesus, but that <b>then
Simon Peter, </b>more volatile than that the other disciples, <b>having a
sword, drew it and struck the high priest's slave, </b>who was among the
officers, <b>and cut off his right ear</b>. This was not his intention; rather,
he wanted to kill him, but the strike to the servant's head missed and struck
the ear. Peter aimed for the head so that he could more easily show that he was
doing it out of zeal for his Lord: "I have been very jealous for the Lord" (1 Kgs
19:10).

<p>2288 Two questions can be asked about this. Since the Lord
had commanded his disciples not to have even two tunics (Mt 10:10), why was it
that Peter had a sword? I answer that Christ gave them this command when he
sent them out to preach, and it was to be in effect until his passion. But when
his passion drew near, Christ revoked it: "When I sent you out with no purse or
bag or sandals, did you lack anything?" (Lk 22:35). And then (in v 36): "But
now, let him who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag. And let him who has
no sword sell his mantle and buy one." Because of this permission Peter
understood that he was allowed to carry a sword.

<p>How could he get a sword so
quickly, since our Lord had spoken these words such a short time before? According
to Chrysostom, Peter obtained the sword earlier, when he heard that the Jews
were planning to deliver Christ over to the chief priests to be crucified.<a
href="John18.htm#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>
Or, we could say, with the Interlinear, that "sword" is used here for a knife,
which he probably had at the paschal meal, and which he took along when they
left.<a href="John18.htm#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>

<p>2289 The second question is why Peter struck the servant of
the high priest, since our Lord had told them not to resist evil (Mt 5:39). One
could answer that they were forbidden to resist someone in order to defend
themselves, but this did not apply to defending the Lord. Or, one could say
that they had not yet been strengthened by a power coming from above: "Stay in
the city, until you are clothed with power from on high" (Lk 24:49). And for
this reason they were not yet so perfect that they could not resist evil
entirely.

<p>2290 Now the name of the servant is given. Only John
mentions this name because, as stated below (v 15), John himself was known by
the high priest, and so he also knew some of the priest's servants. Since John
was certain of this servant's name, he gives it.

<p>It is Luke (22:51) who adds that
our Lord healed the ear. This is appropriate for a mystery: for the servant
stands for the Jewish people, who were oppressed by the chief priests: "You eat
the fat" (Ez 34:3). Peter, the head of the apostles, takes away this servant's
sense of hearing, because he heard the words of the law in a defective way, in
a carnal way. But our Lord gave him back a new sense of hearing: "As soon as
they heard of me they obeyed me" (Ps 18:44). With this in mind the servant is
fittingly named Malchus, which means "king," because through Christ we have
become kings by having a new life: "You ... have made them a kingdom and
priests to our God, and they shall reign on earth" (Rev 5:10).

<p>2291 Now we see the zeal of Peter being restrained. First,
we see Peter's zeal; secondly, the reason it was restrained (11b).

<p>2292 The Evangelist says that Peter drew his sword, and our
Lord said to him, <b>Put your sword into its sheath. </b>It was like saying
that it was not defense that was needed, but patience, and that he was not
allowed to use a material sword: "Ah, sword of the Lord! How long till you are
quiet?" (Jer 47:6). The mystical interpretation is that this signifies that the
sword of God's word was to be put into its sheath, that is, into the faith of
the Gentiles.

<p>2293 The reason Christ restrained Peter is given when he
says, <b>Shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me? </b>For one
should not resist what has been arranged by divine providence: "Who has
resisted him and has had peace?" [Job 9:4]. The passion is called a cup, a
drinking vessel, because the charity of the one suffering gave it a certain
sweetness, but in its own nature it was bitter. It was like a healing medicine
which, because it gives hope of being cured, acquires a certain sweetness,
although it has a bitter taste: "I will lift up the cup of salvation and call
on the name of the Lord" (Ps 116:13).

<p>The Father gave Christ this cup
because Christ willingly underwent the passion by his own will and by the will
of the Father: "You would have no power over me unless it had been given you
from above" (19:11).

<p align=center><b>LECTURE 3

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>12 So the band of soldiers and their captain and the
officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him. 13 First they led him to
Annas; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high
priest that year. 14 It was Caiaphas who had given counsel to the Jews that it
was expedient that one man should die for the people. 15 Simon Peter followed
Jesus, and so did another disciple. As this disciple was known to the high
priest, he entered the court of the high priest along with Jesus, 16 while
Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the
high priest, went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door, and brought
Peter in. 17 The maid who kept the door said to Peter, "Are not you also one of
this man's disciples?" He said, "I am not." 18 Now the servants and officers
had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and
warming themselves; Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself. 19
The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. 20
Jesus answered him, "I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in
synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together, I have said nothing
secretly. 21 Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me, what I said to
them; they know what I said."<a href="John18.htm#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</b></a></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>2294 Now the Evangelist describes how our Lord was taken by
the officers and led before the leaders. First, he is led to one of the
leaders, Annas; secondly, to another, Caiaphas (v 24). In regard to the first
he does two things: first, he mentions how he was presented before Annas;
secondly, how he was questioned by Annas (v 19). In regard to the first he does
two things: he mentions that he is led to Annas' house; secondly, that Christ's
disciples followed him (v 15). In regard to the first he does two things: he
mentions what was done to Jesus; secondly, he describes the high priest before
whom Jesus was brought (v 13b).

<p>2295 Three things were done to Christ. First, he was seized;
for he says, <b>the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the
Jews seized Jesus, </b>who is not apprehensible: "great in counsel,
incomprehensible in thought" [Jer 32:19]. Perhaps they were thinking of the
Psalm (71:11): "God has forsaken him; pursue and seize him, for there is none
to deliver him." Again, "The breath of our mouth, Christ the Lord, is taken in
our sins," that is, on account of our sins, in order to free us: "Even the
captives of the mighty shall be taken" (Is 49:25).

<p>Secondly, Christ was bound, <b>and
bound him, </b>who came to untie their bonds and break their chains: "You have
loosed my bonds" (Ps 116:16).

<p>Thirdly, he was led away, <b>they
led him to Annas, </b>so that they might destroy him who came to lead all to
the way of salvation: "You have led me, because you became my hope" [Ps 61:4].

<p>2296 Two reasons can be given why Jesus was first brought to
Annas. This could have been done by the order of Caiaphas, the high priest that
year. Caiaphas did this because he would have had more of an excuse for
condemning Jesus if Annas had already condemned him. The other reason was that
they were nearer to the house of Annas, which was on their way. They were
fearful that if the people became aroused Jesus might be taken away from them,
and so they made straight for the house of Annas.

<p>2297 Here the high priest is described by his relationship
to Caiaphas, <b>he was the father&#8209;in&#8209;law of Caiaphas. </b>Then
Caiaphas is described as <b>high priest that year. </b>We should remember that
according to the law the high priest was to hold his office for life, and when
he died to be succeeded by his son. But as the envy and the ambition of the leaders
increased, not only did the son not succeed the father, but the office itself
was not held for more than a year; and even then it was bought with money, as
Josephus says. And so it is not out of character that in the year of that high
priesthood, so wickedly obtained, that the high priest acted so despicably.

<p>2298 He is described by the advice he gave: <b>It was
Caiaphas who had given counsel to the Jews that it was expedient that one man
should die for the people </b>(in 11:50). The Evangelist recalls this to
prevent the hearts of the faithful from faltering. He shows that even by the
prophecy of the enemy Christ was captured<i> </i>and killed, not because he was
weak and lacked power, but for the salvation of the people, that is, so the
entire nation would not perish. For the testimony of one's adversary is very
effective; and truth is of such a nature that even its enemy is unable not to
speak it.

<p>2299 Now we see how the disciples joined Christ. First, how
Peter and another disciple followed him; secondly, we see how they entered the
place where Christ was; thirdly, how one denied him.

<p>2300 In regard to the first he says, <b>Simon Peter followed
Jesus</b>, because of his devotedness, but at a distance because of his fear, <b>and
so did another disciple, </b>John, who out of humility does not mention
himself. We can understand from this that the other disciples fled and
abandoned Jesus, as Matthew says (26:56).

<p>2301 In the mystical interpretation, these two disciples
indicate the two ways of life in which Christ is followed: the active life,
which is signified by Peter, and the contemplative life, signified by John.
Those in the active life follow Christ by obedience, "My sheep hear my voice"
(10:27). Those in the contemplative life follow Christ by knowledge and
contemplation, "We will know and follow you" [Ps 4:3].

<p>2302 These two disciples followed Christ because they loved
him more than the others did; and so they were the first to come to the tomb
(20:2). And it was these two who came because they were united to each other by
a stronger bond of love; and so they are frequently mentioned together in the
Gospel and in the Acts, where we read that "They sent to them Peter and John"
(Acts 8:14), and again that "Peter and John were going up to the temple at the
hour of prayer" (Acts 3:1).

<p>2303 Now the order in which they entered is given: John
entered first and then he brought in Peter (v 16).

<p>2304 It was John who entered first, with Jesus, <b>as this
disciple was known to the high priest ... while Peter stood outside at the door.
</b>Although John had been a fisherman and had been called as a young man by
Christ, he was still known by the high priest, either because John's father was
a servant of the high priest, or a relative. John did not mention that the high
priest knew him because he was proud, but because of his humility, so that the
fact that he was the first to enter, with Jesus, into the court of the high
priest, ahead of Peter, would not be ascribed to his virtue and superiority
rather than to his acquaintance with the high priest. Thus he says, <b>as this
disciple</b>, John himself, <b>was known to the high priest</b>. Consequently,
he was able to enter with Jesus into the high priest's court, where Christ had
been led. <b>While Peter stood outside</b>;<b> </b>this was like a foreboding
of his future denial: "Those who saw me, fled outside from me" [Ps 31:11].

<p>2305 Mystically understood, John enters with Jesus because
the contemplative life is one of familiarity with Jesus: "When I enter my
house, I shall find rest with her [wisdom]" (Wis 8:16). Peter stands outside
because the active life is busy with exterior things: "Mary sat at the Lord's
feet and listened to his teaching. But Martha was distracted with much serving"
(Lk 10:39).

<p>2306 Here we see how Peter was let in due to John's
intervention, because <b>the other disciple, John who was known to the high
priest, went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door, </b>with the
intention of bringing Peter in, and then he brought Peter in. The mystical
interpretation of this is that the active life is brought to Christ by the
contemplative life: for just as the lower reason is directed by the higher
reason, so the active life is directed by the contemplative life: "Oh send out
your light and your truth; let them lead me, let them bring me to your holy
hill and to your dwelling" (Ps 43:3).

<p>2307 Now we see the denial of Peter: first, the
circumstances or the incitement of his denial; secondly the denial itself (v
17b); thirdly, Peter strengthens his denial (v 18).

<p>2308 The circumstances and incitement of his denial was the
question of the maid who kept the door: <b>The maid who kept the door said to
Peter, Are not you also one of this man's disciples?</b> She says <b>you also</b>
because she knew that John was a disciple of Christ, but she did not mention
this to him because of their friendliness. This incident shows how weak Peter
was at that time, for he was incited to deny Christ under feeble circumstances.
How weak these circumstances were is shown, first of all, from the person who
asked him: for it was not an armed soldier or an imposing high priest, but a
woman, and a door keeper at that. Secondly, from the very form of the question:
she did not say, "Are you a disciple of that traitor?" but rather, <b>Are not
you also one of this man's disciples?</b> This seemed to indicate a certain
sympathy. We can learn from this that "By the word of the Lord the heavens were
made, and all their power by the breath of his mouth" [Ps 33:6], because this
same person who denied Christ at the questioning of a maid servant afterwards
professed and preached the name of Christ before the chief priests (Acts 4:8).

<p>2309 Now comes Peter's denial, when he says, <b>He said, I
am not</b>. We should note, according to Augustine, that Christ is denied not
only by those who say that he is not the Christ, but also by those who deny
that they are Christians.<a href="John18.htm#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>
For Peter at this time did nothing other than deny that he was a Christian. Our
Lord permitted Peter to deny him because he wanted the very one who was to be
the head of the entire Church to be all the more compassionate to the weak and
sinners, having experienced in himself his own weakness in the face of sin:
"For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weakness,
but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sinning" (Heb
4:15). This is true of Christ, and it can also be said of Peter, with his sins.

<p>Some say that Peter's denial did
not come from fear, but from love: for he wanted to always be with Christ and
to follow him all the time. But he knew that if he admitted he was a disciple
of Christ, he would have been separated from him and expelled. But this does
not agree with our Lord's words: for Peter did not deny Christ because he
feared to be separated from him, but because he was not willing to lay down his
life for Christ. Before, when Peter said, "I will lay down my life for you,"
Jesus answered, "Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to
you, the cock will not crow, till you have denied me three times" (13:37).

<p>2310 We see Peter strengthen his denial when we read, <b>Now
the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire ... Peter also was with
them, standing and warming himself, </b>so he would not seem to be one of
Christ's disciples. Trying not to seem a disciple, he mixed with the servants
and officers standing by the fire because of the cold, which sometimes occurs
in March during the early spring. Peter was not attentive to the Psalm: "Be
holy with the holy, persevere with those who persevere" [Ps 18:26]. Even the
very time of the year corresponded to his heart, in which charity had grown
cold: "Most men's love will grow cold" (Mt 24: 12).

<p>2311 <b>The high priest then questioned Jesus. </b>First we
see Christ's interrogation; secondly, his reply (v 20); thirdly, he is abused
for his reply (v 22).

<p>2312 Two charges were brought against Christ by the Jews: he
had false and novel teachings: "What is this? A new teaching!" (Mk 1:27); and
he was inciting civil discord, gathering his own followers: "He stirs up the
people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place" (Lk
23:5). Consequently, he is interrogated on these two points: first, about his
followers, <b>about his disciples</b>, whom were thought to be misled;
secondly, about <b>his teaching</b>, regarded as false.

<p>2213 Now our Lord's answer is given: first, we see his
manner of teaching; secondly, he asks for the testimony of others (v 21). Two
things are done about the first: we see how Christ taught his doctrine;
secondly, this is further described.

<p>2314 He says, <b>I have spoken openly to the world. </b>This
seems to conflict with "The hour is coming when I shall no longer speak to you
in figures but tell you plainly of the Father" (16:25). So, if he had not yet
spoken openly to his disciples, how could he have spoken openly to the world? I
answer that he had not yet spoken openly to his disciples in the sense that he
had set forth for them his most profound thoughts. But he did speak openly to
the world in the sense that he spoke to many, publicly.

<p>2315 This is described more fully as he says, <b>I have always
taught in the synagogues and in the temple</b>.<b> </b>On the contrary, Matthew
(c 16) shows that Christ taught his disciples when alone with them many things
without using figures. This can be answered in three ways. First, what Christ
said to the twelve disciples was not considered to be spoken in secret.
Secondly, he did not teach these things to them with the intention that they be
kept hidden. Thirdly, our Lord is speaking here of the teaching he gave to the
people, which was not given to them secretly but in public places: "I have told
the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation" (Ps 40:9); "I did not
speak in secret, in a land of darkness" (Is 45:19).

<p>2316 To support him he asks for the testimony of others,
saying, <b>Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me, what I said to them.
</b>First, he sends them to the testimony of others; secondly, he shows whose
testimony he wants; thirdly, he gives the reason for this.

<p>As to the first he says, <b>Why do
you ask me?</b> He is saying in effect: You can find this out from others. And
then he adds, referring to the second point, <b>Ask those who have heard me</b>:
"Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how to entangle him in his talk" (Mt
22:15). Nevertheless, they could not find anything against him. Then he gives
the reason for his request saying, <b>they know what I said, </b>and they can
testify to this.

<p>2317 After telling us of our Lord's answer, the Evangelist
now shows how it was rebuked: first, we see the rebuke given by an officer;
secondly, our Lord's defense of his answer (v 23).

<p>2318 An officer reproached our Lord's answer, first of all,
by an action. He delivered a reproving blow; for the Evangelist says, <b>When
he</b>, that is, Jesus, <b>had said this, one of the officers</b>, of the high
priest, <b>standing by struck Jesus with his hand</b>. This did not happen by
chance; it had been predicted long before and many times: "I gave my back to
the smiters, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard" (Is 50:6); "Let
him give his cheek to the smiter, and be filled with insults" (Lam 3:30); "With
a rod they strike upon the cheek the ruler of Israel" (Mic 5:1).

<p>Secondly, the officer reproached
Christ with words, saying, <b>Is that how your answer the high priest? </b>We
can see from this that Annas was a high priest, and that Jesus had not yet been
sent to Caiaphas. This is why Luke mentions two high priests: "in the high&#8209;priesthood
of Annas and Caiaphas" (Lk 3:2). Two high priests are mentioned because they
alternated as high priests, but that year Annas [really Caiaphas] was the high
priest.

<p>2319 Earlier, when the testimony of those who had heard
Jesus was being sought, and the chief priests had sent their officers to arrest
him (7:32), they themselves were captivated by the words of Jesus and returned
saying, "No man ever spoke like this man" (7:46). The officer who now struck
Christ was incited to do so in order to show that he had not been one of those
in the prior group. He thought that Christ had shown a lack of respect because
in saying, <b>Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me</b>, he seemed to
be finding fault with the high priest for asking a thoughtless question, and it
is written: "You will not speak evil of a ruler of your people" [Ex 23:28].

<p>2320 Jesus justified himself, saying, <b>If I have spoken
wrongly</b>, in my answer to the high priest, <b>bear witness to the wrong. </b>That
is, if your have reason to reproach me for what I have just said, show that I
have spoken badly, because "Only on the evidence of two witnesses, or of three
witnesses, shall a charge be sustained" (Deut 19:18). <b>But if I have spoken
rightly</b>, if you cannot show I have spoken badly, <b>why do you strike me?</b>
Why flare up against me?

<p>Or, this reply of Christ could be
referred to what he had said before this time: "Ask those who have heard me,
what I said to them" (v 21). Then the meaning is: <b>If I have spoken badly</b>,
in the synagogue and in the temple, which I should not have done, <b>bear
witness to the wrong</b>, report what I have said to the high priest. But the
officer was unable to do his. <b>But if I have spoken rightly</b>, that is,
taught rightly, <b>Why do you strike me?</b> In other words: This is unjust:
"Is evil a recompense for good? Yet they have dug a pit for my life" (Jer
18:20).

<p>2321 A difficulty arises here for in Matthew our Lord
commanded his disciples, "If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him
the other also" (Mt 5:39). And we also read about Christ that "Jesus began to
do and teach" (Acts 1:1). So, Christ ought to have done himself what he had
taught others to do. But he did not do this. Indeed, he did the contrary and
defended himself.

<p>I say to this, with Augustine, that
the statements and commands found in sacred scripture can be interpreted and
understood from the actions of the saints, since it is the same Holy Spirit who
inspired the prophets and the other sacred authors and who inspires the actions
of the saints. As we read: "Moved by the Holy Spirit holy men of God spoke" (2
Pet 1:21); and "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God" (Rom
8:14). Thus, sacred scripture should be understood according to the way Christ
and other holy persons followed it. Now, Christ did not turn his other cheek
here; and Paul did not do so either (Acts 16:22). Accordingly, we should not
think that Christ has commanded us to actually turn our physical cheek to one
who has struck the other. We should understand it to mean that we should be
ready to do this if it turned out to be necessary to do so. That is, our
attitude should be such that we would not be inwardly stirred up against the
one striking us, but be ready or disposed to endure the same or even more. This
is how out Lord observed it, for he offered his body to be killed.<a
href="John18.htm#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>
So, our Lord's defense is useful for our instruction.

<p>2322 Now there is mention that he was sent from one high
priest to the other. First, it is mentioned that Jesus was sent to the other
high priest; secondly, the narration of Peter's denial is completed (v 25).

<p>2323 He says, <b>Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the
high priest, </b>to whom he was originally being led. We saw before why he had
been first brought to Annas. Note the wickedness of Annas: although he ought to
have released Christ, since he was without fault, he yet sent him tied to
Caiaphas.

<p>2324 Now the second and third denials of Peter are
presented: first, the circumstances of the denials; secondly, the two denials;
and thirdly, the fulfillment of Christ's prediction (v 27).

<p>2325 The circumstance of Peter's second denial was his
staying with the officers of the high priest who were standing near the fire.
Chrysostom says that although Christ was on his way to Caiaphas, Peter still
remained with the officers [by the fire].  Peter had become so preoccupied with
his sin after his denial that he, who before was so ardent, now seemed not to
care what happened to Christ: "No man repents of his wickedness, saying, 'What
have I done?'" (Jer 8:6). For Chrysostom, <b>Simon Peter was still standing and
warming himself, </b>although Christ had already left, unmindful of the saying:
"Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked" (Ps 1:1).<a
href="John18.htm#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>

<p>But this interpretation is not
acceptable because it would follow that Peter's second and third denials were
made in the absence of Christ. This is contrary to Luke (22:61), who says that
after the third denial of Peter, our Lord turned and looked at him. For this
reason Augustine explains it another way and says that the Evangelist is giving
a general view in his own way to show the connection and order of the denials.
The Evangelist had said above that "the servants and officers had made a
charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming
themselves; Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself" (v 18). The
Evangelist then interposes the examination of Christ by the high priest (v 19&#8209;23),
and immediately returns to continue the series of Peter's denials, using
practically the same words as before, "Now Simon Peter was standing and warming
himself" (v 25), that is, referring to the time before Christ was sent to
Caiaphas.

<p>2326 Then the Evangelist mentions the next two denials of
Peter (v 25). Two things are stated about each: the circumstance of the denial,
that is, the question, and the denial itself. There are two questions about the
literal meaning. When Matthew speaks of the second denial, he says, "And when
he went out to the porch, another maid saw him, and she said to the bystanders,
'This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.' And again he denied it with an oath" (Mt
26:71&#8209;2). There seems to be two disagreements here. John says that Peter
denied Christ by the fire (v 25), and Matthew says this happened as Peter was
going out to the porch. Again, in Matthew, Peter is questioned by another maid,
but John has him questioned by others, that is, a number of others, for he
says, <b>They said to him, Are not you also one of his disciples? </b>(v 25).
Luke also says that Christ was questioned by one person, "And after an interval
of about an hour still another insisted, saying, 'Certainly this man also was
with him'" (Lk 22:59). [This is the third denial in Luke, and his second denial
is also instigated by one person, Lk 22:58].

<p>We should say to these points that
after Peter first denied Christ, he then got up and as he was going out to the
porch another maid questioned him. Or, this maid told others that Peter was one
of them, as Matthew says (Mt 26:71). Thus Peter denied Christ a second time.
After this Peter returned so as to avoid seeming to be a follower of Christ and
sat with the others. As he was sitting there, bystanders, who had heard it from
the maid, questioned him again, as Matthew says (Mt 26:73). Or, one of the
servants asked first, as John has here (v 26) and then other bystanders joined
in. This was Peter's third denial.

<p>About this third denial, John says,
<b>One of the servants of the high priest, a kinsman of the man whose ear Peter
had cut off</b>. This person testified to what he had seen, <b>Did I not see you
in the garden with him? </b>And so after an interval of an hour Peter again
denied it, the third time.

<p>It is not important if other
Evangelists say that the third question was asked by several persons, while
John has it asked by one. For it is possible that this man, being more certain,
asked first, and that incited the others to ask also. Those who were standing
about said many things about this matter, and one Evangelist speaks of one of
these, and another of something else. This happened because their main
intention was not to note these details, but to show the statement Peter made
and to show that what our Lord had said to Peter came true. Accordingly, all
agree on what Peter said: "What the Lord speaks, that will I speak" (Num
24:13).

<p>2327 Now he mentions the sign given by Christ which Peter
recalled. <b>And at once the cock crowed, </b>moved by God's power, so that the
prediction of the physician would be fulfilled and to demonstrate the
presumption of the one who was sick.

<p align=center><b>LECTURE 5

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>28 Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the
praetorium [to Caiaphas, to the praetorium]. It was early. They themselves did
not enter the praetorium, so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the
passover. 29 So Pilate went out to them and said, "What accusation do you bring
against this man?" 30 They answered him, "If this man were not an evildoer, we
would not have handed him over." 31 Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves
and judge him by your own law." The Jews said to him, "It is not lawful for us
to put any man to death." 32 This was to fulfill the word which Jesus had
spoken to show by what death he was to die.</BLOCKQUOTE></b>

<p>2328 Now the Evangelist tells about Christ's being handed
over to the Gentiles: first, we see him delivered to the governor; secondly,
Christ is examined by him (v 29); thirdly, the governor declares that Christ is
innocent (v 38b). He does three things about the first: the place where Christ
was delivered is stated; secondly, the time; thirdly, the way he was handed
over.

<p>2329 The place was the praetorium, for he says, <b>They led
Jesus to Caiaphas, to the praetorium. </b>This is the place where judgment is
given. In the army the commander's tent was known as the praetorium; and so
this residence of the governor was also called a praetorium.

<p>But how can Christ be led to
Caiaphas, to the praetorium? One could say that Caiaphas had come ahead to the
residence of Pilate to tell him that Jesus would be handed over to him. And so
Jesus was led to Caiaphas when he was in the praetorium with Pilate. Or, one
could say that since Caiaphas was the high priest, he had a large dwelling, so
large that the governor lived there and made it his residence. Then the meaning
is: <b>they led Jesus to Caiaphas</b>, to his residence, and so <b>to the
praetorium.</b>

<p>Or, one could say that the Greek
text is better, which says, <b>Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the
praetorium. </b>This takes away the problem.

<p>2330 The time is mentioned, <b>It was early</b>, for their
villainy was so great that they could hardly wait to turn him over to Pilate to
be killed: "Woe to those who devise wickedness and work evil upon their beds!
When the morning dawns, they perform it" (Mic 2:1); "The murderer rises at the
light" (Job 24:14).

<p>Here we find a difficult problem.
The other three Evangelists say that early in the evening Christ was struck at
the residence of Caiaphas, and questioned by him: "If you are the Christ, tell
us" (Luke 22:67), and in the morning Christ was led to Pilate. But John says
that he was led to Caiaphas. If we want to keep to the letter of the text, we
could say that Caiaphas first saw Jesus when he was at the house of Annas,
during the night, and at that time Christ could be examined by him.

<p>But there still remains the
difficulty that they say that Christ was struck at the residence of Caiaphas.
This is solved by the Greek text which says that "they led Jesus from Caiaphas
to the praetorium," because then during the night he was led from the residence
of Annas to the residence of Caiaphas, where he was struck and examined by him,
and in the morning he was led from Caiaphas to the praetorium.

<p>2331 <b>They themselves did not enter the praetorium, so
that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover. </b>Here we see,
first, their useless superstition, because they would not go into the praetorium.
Secondly, we see the deference Pilate paid them, since he went out to meet
them. A problem arises about the first point: that they would not enter the
praetorium so as not to be defiled. The other Evangelists say that Christ was
seized in the evening, on the day of the supper; and this would be the passover
meal: "I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you" (Lk 22:15). And
then in the morning of the next day he was brought to the praetorium. Why then
do we read <b>so that they might eat the passover</b>,<b> </b>since it was the
day after the passover? Some of the modem Greeks say that we are now on the
fourteenth lunar day of the month, and that Christ was crucified on the day the
Jews celebrated the passover, but that Christ anticipated the passover by one
day, since he knew he would be killed on the day of the Jewish passover. Thus,
he celebrated the passover on the thirteenth lunar day, in the evening. And
since the law commanded that the Jews should not have leavened bread from the
fourteenth day of the first month to the twenty&#8209;first day, they say that
Christ consecrated leavened bread.

<p>2332 This is not acceptable for two reasons. First, the Old
Testament has no instance where anyone was permitted to anticipate the
celebration of the passover. But if one was prevented, he could postpone it to
the next month: "If any man of you or of your descendants is unclean ... he
shall still keep the passover to the Lord. In the second month on the
fourteenth day in the evening they shall keep it "(Num 9:10). And since Christ
never omitted any observance of the law, it is not true to say that he
anticipated the passover. Secondly, Mark (14:12) states explicitly that Christ
came on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the passover
lamb; and Matthew says that "on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples
came to Jesus saying, 'Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the
passover?'" (Mt 26:17). So, we should not say that Christ anticipated the
passover.

<p>2333 Accordingly, Chrysostom explains this another way.<a
href="John18.htm#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>
He said that Christ fulfilled the law in all matters and did observe the
passover on the proper day, that is, the fourteenth day, in the evening. But
the Jews were so intent on killing Christ that they did not observe it on the
proper day, but on the day following, the fifteenth. Thus the sense is: <b>so
that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover </b>which they had
neglected the day before.

<p>This is not acceptable either, for
in Numbers (9:10) it is said that if anyone is prevented from eating the
passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, he is to eat it, not on the
following day, but on the fourteenth day of the second month.

<p>2334 Therefore we should say with Jerome, Augustine and
other Latin Fathers, that the fourteenth day is the beginning of the feast; but
the passover refers not just to that evening, but to the entire time of the
seven days during which they ate unleavened bread, which was to be eaten by
those who were clean.<a href="John18.htm#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>
And because the Jews would have contracted uncleanness by entering the
residence of a foreign judge, they did not enter so that <b>they might not be
defiled, but might eat the passover, </b>that is, the unleavened bread.

<p>See their wicked blindness, for
they feared becoming defiled from a gentile man, but did not fear to shed the
blood of a God and a man, "Those who laid you waste go forth from you" (Is
49:17).

<p>2335 Now we see the deference Pilate showed them when he
says, <b>So Pilate went out to them, </b>to take Christ, whom they were
offering, and said, <b>What accusation do you bring against this man? </b>In
this examination of Christ, we see first, how Christ is examined before his
accusers by Pilate; secondly, how Christ is examined by Pilate in private (v
33). Concerning the first he does two things: first, we have Pilate's
questioning; secondly, his generous concession to the Jews, <b>Take him
yourselves</b>.

<p>2336 Concerning the first, we have the examination by
Pilate, and then the malicious reply of the Jews. When Pilate saw Jesus bound
and brought by so may seeking his condemnation, he said, <b>What accusation do
you bring against this man? </b>Their reply was, <b>If this man were not an
evildoer, we would not have handed him over. </b>They are saying here: We have
already examined and condemned him, and are now handing him over to you to be
punished. They were regarding their own judgment as sufficient for Pilate. Yet
they were not speaking truly when they said he was an evildoer, for "He went
about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil" (Acts 10:38).
They were acting like the Psalm says, "They requite me evil for good" (Ps
35:12).

<p>2337 Luke is different, for he says that the Jews accused
Christ of many crimes: "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea,
from Galilee even to this place" (Lk 23:5). I reply that, as Augustine says,
the Jews said many things to Pilate at that time, and it could be that they
first said what John reports, and then said what Luke tells us.<a href="John18.htm#_ftn17"
name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>

<p>2338 The Evangelist now mentions Pilate's generous
concession (v 31): first, we see this concession; secondly, the Jews refuse it;
and thirdly, we see the reason for their refusal (v 32).

<p>2339 Pilate said, <b>Take him yourselves, </b>intending to
do them a favor. Festus did the same to Paul: "But Festus, wishing to do the
Jews a favor, said to Paul, 'Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem, and there be
tried on these charges before me?'" (Acts 25:9). Or, this could be said as a
taunting remark: for they had already examined and condemned Christ, and Pilate
wanted those who had condemned Christ as an evildoer to pass the sentence,
because "It was not the custom of the Romans to give up any one before the
accused met the accusers face to face, and had opportunity to make his defense
concerning the charge laid against him" (Acts 25:16). So the meaning is then:
You want my judgment, but <b>Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law</b>,<b>
</b>for I will never be that kind of a judge.

<p>2340 The refusal of the Jews is mentioned when he says, <b>The
Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death. </b>This
seems not to agree with Exodus [22:18]: "You will not permit a sorcerer to
live." And they regarded Jesus as a sorcerer.

<p>According to Augustine the meaning
is, <b>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death </b>on a feast day, but
it is lawful on other days.<a href="John18.htm#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>
Or, according to Chrysostom, the Jews had lost much of their power: for they
could not pass judgment on a crime against the state.<a href="John18.htm#_ftn19"
name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>
But here they intended to condemn Christ especially for matters against the
state: "Everyone who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar" (19:12).
This is why they said, <b>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death</b>,<b>
</b>for crimes against the state, although we can do this for some sins against
the law, for this kind of judgment was reserved to them. Or, it could be said
that some things are not lawful either because they are prohibited by divine
law &#8209; and they were not prohibited from doing this by divine law &#8209;
or because they are forbidden by human law &#8209; and in this way it was not
lawful for them to put anyone to death, for such power was now in the hands of
the governor.

<p>2341 There is another question: How then could they have
stoned Stephen (Acts 7:58)? Chrysostom answers this by saying that the Romans
allowed the Jews to make use of their own laws, and because the punishment of
stoning was part of their law, the Romans allowed them to do this.<a
href="John18.htm#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>
But in the law death on the cross was abhorred: "A hanged [on a tree] man is
accursed by God" (Deut 21:23). And so they did not use this kind of death. The
Jews, in their malice, were not satisfied just to stone Christ, they wanted to
condemn him to the most disgraceful of deaths, as we see from Wisdom (2:20).
Thus they now say, <b>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death, </b>meaning
the death on the cross. Or, one could say that Stephen was stoned during a
change of governors, when many laws were violated.

<p>2342 The Evangelist gives the reason the Jews refused when
he says, <b>This was to fulfill the word which Jesus had spoken to show by what
death he was to die. </b>The words <b>this was to fulfill </b>do not indicate
the intention the Jews had, but the arrangement of God's providence. For Jesus
had said (Mt 20:19) that it was by the Gentiles that he would be crucified and
killed, but that he would be handed over to them by the Jews. So, in order that
this be accomplished, the Jews were unwilling to judge and kill him themselves.

servants would fight, that I might not be handed over to the Jews; but my
kingship [kingdom] is not from the world." 37 Pilate said to him, "So you are a
king?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for
this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is
of the truth hears my voice." 38 Pilate said to him, "What is truth?" After he
had said this, he went out to the Jews again, and told them, "I find no crime
in him. 39 But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the
Passover; will you have me release for you the King of the Jews?" 40 They cried
out again, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.<a

<p>2343 Above, the Evangelist told how Pilate examined Christ
before those who accused him; here he describes how Pilate questioned him in
private. First, the Evangelist gives Pilate's question; then, the answer of
Jesus (v 34). In regard to the first he does two things: first, we have
Pilate's question; secondly, we see Christ asking the reason for the question, <b>Do
you say this of your own accord?</b>

<p>2344 In regard to the first, note that Pilate, as a just
judge, and as one proceeding cautiously, did not immediately agree with the
accusation of the high priest, "You shall not follow a multitude to do evil;
nor shall you bear witness in a suit, turning aside after a multitude, so as to
pervert justice" (Ex 23:2). Rather, <b>Pilate entered the praetorium again and
called Jesus </b>aside, because he had serious doubts about him. So he called
Christ over to examine the case more closely and to allow Christ to answer in
more peace and away from the shouts of the Jews: "I searched out the cause of
him whom I did not know" (Job 29:16).

<p>2345 Then Pilate said to him, <b>Are you the King of the
Jews?</b> This shows, as Luke says (Lk 23:2), that the Jews were accusing
Christ of this crime, although John says only that "If this man were not an
evildoer, we would not have handed him over" (18:30), and may other crimes were
laid on him. But the charge about his being a king touched the heart of Pilate
most, and that is why he questioned him only about this: "For out of the
abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" (Mt 12:34).

<p>2346 Then (v 34), Jesus is seen questioning his examiner:
first, we have Christ's question; then Pilate's answer, <b>Am I a Jew?</b>

<p>2347 The Evangelist says, <b>Jesus answered</b>, asking a
question in return, <b>Do you say this of your own accord or did others say it
to you about me?</b> There are two reasons why someone asks a question.
Sometimes it is to find out something that the questioner does not know; as
when a student questions his teacher. Sometimes one asks a question about
things he already knows in order to learn what answer will be given; as when a
teacher questions his student. Now our Lord knew both what he asked about, and
what answer would be given, and thus he was not asking out of ignorance, "All
are open and laid bear to the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (Heb 4:13).
Rather, he asked so that we might know what the Jews and Gentiles thought, and
at the same time be taught about that kingdom.

<p>2348 <b>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew?</b> Why did he answer
this way? Because our Lord had asked him whether he said this on his own.
Pilate showed by this that it was not his concern to inquire if Christ was the
King of the Jews; it was rather the affair of the Jews, whose King he said he
was. By giving this answer Pilate showed that it was others who had told him
that Christ was the King of the Jews. Accordingly he says, <b>Your own nation
and the chief priests have handed you over to me</b>, by bringing this charge
against you. He says, <b>your own nation</b>, because, considering his human
nature, Christ was born a Jew: "For I hear many whispering. Terror is on every
side. 'Denounce him! Let us denounce him!' say all my familiar friends" (Jer
20:10); "A man's enemies are the men of his own house" (Mic 7:6). And we read <b>chief
priests</b>, because the greater their power the greater their crime: "And in
this faithlessness the hand of the officials and chief men has been foremost"
(Ezra 9:2); "I will go to the great, and will speak to them; for they know the
way of the Lord, the law of their God. But they all alike had broken the yoke,
they had burst the bonds" (Jer 5:5). If they have handed you over to me, <b>What
have you done?</b> It's unbelievable that they would have handed you over to me
except for some serious matter.

<p>2349 Now Christ's answer is given: and first, the mistaken
impression about his kingdom is corrected; secondly, the truth is established
(37b). As to the first he does two things: the mistaken impression is
corrected; and a sign is given as proof, <b>if my kingdom were of this
world....</b>

<p>2350 The false idea of Christ's kingdom is rejected by his
saying, <b>My kingdom is not of this world. </b>The Manicheans misunderstood
this, and said that there were two gods and two kingdoms; there was a good god,
who had his kingdom in a region of light, and an evil god, who had his kingdom
in a region of darkness, and this darkness was this world, because all material
things, they said, were darkness. The meaning would then be, <b>My kingdom is
not of this world, </b>that is, God, the Father, who is good, and I, do not
have our kingdom in this region of darkness.

<p>But this is contrary to, "God is
the king of all the earth" (Ps 47:7); and again, "Whatever the Lord pleases he
does, in heaven and on earth" (Ps 134:6). Thus we should say that Christ said
this for the sake of Pilate, who believed that Christ was claiming an earthly
kingdom in which he would reign in the physical way that those of earth do, and
so should be punished by death for trying to reign unlawfully.

<p>2351 Sometimes the word <b>kingdom </b>means the people who
reign, and sometimes the authority to reign. Taking the word in its first
sense, Augustine says, <b>My kingdom, </b>that is, my faithful &#8209; you
"have made them a kingdom ... to our Lord" (Rev 5:10) &#8209; <b>is not of this
world.<a href="John18.htm#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><b>[22]</b></a>
</b>He does not say they are not "in the world" (17:11), but that they are <b>not
of this world, </b>because of what they love and imitate, since they have been
wrested from it by grace. For this is how God has delivered us from the power
of darkness and has brought us into the kingdom of his love.

<p>Chrysostom explains this sentence
by taking <b>kingdom</b> in the second sense, and says, <b>My kingdom</b>, that
is, the power and authority which makes me a king, <b>is not of this world</b>,
that is, does not have its origin in earthly causes and human choice, but from
another source, from the Father: "His dominion is an everlasting dominion,
which shall not pass away" (Dan 7:14).<a href="John18.htm#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"
title="">[23]</a>

<p>2352 Here he shows by clear signs that his kingdom is not of
this world: first, a sign is given; secondly, the conclusion is drawn (v 36).

<p>2353 In regard to the first, note that one who has an
earthly kingdom, whether by right or by force, needs associates and ministers
to keep him in power: the reason being that he is powerful through his
ministers, not all by himself: "There was a long war between the house of Saul
and the house of David; and David grew stronger and stronger, while the house
of Saul became weaker and weaker" (2 Sam 3:1). But the heavenly king, because
he is powerful by himself, gives power to his servants; and consequently he
does not need ministers for his kingdom. And thus Christ says that his kingdom
is not of this world, because <b>if my kingdom were of this world, my ministers
would fight, that I might not be handed over to the Jews. </b>When Peter
started to fight for Christ (18:10), he forgot that he was not of this world.
Still, our Lord did have some ministers, the angels, who could have rescued him
from the hands of the Jews, but he chose not to be rescued: "Do you think that
I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve
legions of angels?" (Mt 26:53).

<p>2354 <b>But my kingdom is not from the world</b>, that is,
because Christ does not need such ministers, he concludes that his <b>kingdom
is not from the world, </b>that is, does not have its source from this world.
And yet it is here, because it is everywhere: "She [Wisdom] reaches mightily from
one end of the earth to the other, and she orders all things well" (Wis 8:1);
"Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the
earth your possession" (Ps 2:8); "And to him was given dominion and glory and
kingdom, that all peoples, nations and languages should serve him" (Dan 7:14).

<p>2355 Now our Lord reveals the truth about his kingdom:
first, we see the circumstances for this; secondly, the revelation itself; and
thirdly, the effect this revelation had, <b>What is truth?</b>

<p>2356 In respect to the first, note that Pilate understood
our Lord's statements to mean that he did have a physical kingdom, but far
away: "The unspiritual man does not receive the gifts of the Spirit of God ...
and he is not able to understand them" (1 Cor 2:14). Accordingly he was in a
hurry to know the truth, and so said, <b>So you are a king?</b>, you also?

<p>2357 When he answers, <b>You say that I am a king</b>,
Christ first says that he is a king; secondly, he shows the nature of his
kingdom (v 37); thirdly, he mentions those over whom he reigns, <b>Every one
who is of the truth</b>.

<p>2358 With regard to the first, note that our Lord's answer
about his kingship was so worded that he neither seemed to be clearly asserting
that he was a king &#8209; since he was not a king in the sense in which Pilate
understood it &#8209; nor denying it &#8209; since spiritually he was the King
of Kings.

<p>He says, <b>You say that I am a
king</b>, in the physical sense in which I am not a king; but in another way I
am a king, "Behold a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule in
justice" (Is 32:1).

<p>2359 He shows the character and nature of his kingdom when
he says, <b>For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to
bear witness to the truth. </b>This is explained in two ways.

<p>In one way by Augustine, so that
the kingdom of Christ is his faithful, as was said above. Thus, Christ reigns
over his faithful; and he came into the world to gather his faithful to himself
and establish a kingdom: "A nobleman went into a far country to receive a
kingdom" [Lk 19:12]. The meaning then is this: <b>For this I was born</b>, that
is, for this purpose I was born in the flesh. He explains this saying, <b>and
for this I have come into the world, </b>by physical birth &#8209; for this is
the way he came into the world, "God sent his Son into the world" [Gal 4:4] &#8209;
<b>to bear witness to the truth, </b>that is, to myself, who am the truth,
"Even if I do bear witness to myself, my testimony is true" (8:14). And to the
extent that I manifest myself, the Truth, to that extent I establish my
kingdom. For this cannot be done without manifesting the truth, which can only
be done fittingly by me, who am the light: "The only Son, who is in the bosom
of the Father, he has made him known" (1:18); "It was declared at first by the
Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard him, while God also bore
witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by the gifts of the Holy
Spirit" (Heb 2:3).

<p>2360 Chrysostom explains it differently, this way.<a
href="John18.htm#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>
You ask if I am a king, and I say that I am: but I am a king by divine power,
because <b>for this I was born</b>, that is, born from the Father, by an
eternal birth; just as I am God from God, so I am king from king: "I was
appointed king" [Ps 2:6], and then follows, "Today I have begotten you" [v 7].
Then when he adds <b>and for this I have come into the world, </b>it is not to
explain the previous words, but to refer to his birth in time. It is like
saying: Although I am an eternal king, yet I have come into the world for this,
<b>to bear witness to the truth, </b>that is, to myself, that I am a king from
God the Father.

<p>2361 Now he shows over whom he reigns. Before (10:11), he
said that he was a shepherd and those under him were sheep; that is the same as
what he is saying here, that he is a king and his subjects are the kingdom.
This is so because a king is to his subjects as a shepherd to his sheep; and
just as a shepherd feeds his sheep &#8209; "Should not shepherds feed the
sheep?" (Ez 34:2) &#8209; so a king supports his subjects. He said in
particular, "My sheep hear my voice" (10:27); accordingly, he also says here, <b>every
one who is of the truth hears my voice, </b>not just outwardly, but with an
interior belief and love, and carrying this out in action: "Every one who has
heard and learned from the Father comes to me" (6:45). But why does a person
hear my voice? Because such a one is <b>of the truth, </b>which is God.

<p>2362 But since all of us are from God, all are of the truth
and hear his voice. We can answer this by saying that all are from God by
creation, and this is one way we are of God. But besides this, some are said to
be of God because they love and imitate him. We read before, "You are not of
God" (8:47), that is, considering your affections, but you are of God by
creation. <b>Every one hears my voice</b>, with belief and love, <b>who is of
the truth, </b>that is, who has accepted the duty of loving the truth.

<p>2363 He does not say, "Every one who hears my voice is of
the truth," because it would follow that we are of the truth because we
believed. But actually, we believe because we are of the truth, that is,
because we have received the gift of God which enables us to believe and love
the truth: "By grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your
own doing, it is the gift of God" (Eph 2:8); "For it has been granted to you
that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer
for his sake" (Phil 1:29).

<p>2364 Now the Evangelist tells us the effect of Christ's
answer. We can see from this that Pilate abandoned his idea that Christ had an
earthly kingdom, and now thought of Christ as a king in the sense of one who
teaches the truth. He desired to learn this truth and to become a member of
this kingdom and so he said, <b>What is truth? </b>He was not asking for a
definition of truth, but wanted to know that truth by whose power he could
become a member of this kingdom. This indicates that truth was not known by the
world and had vanished from almost everyone, as long as they remained
unbelievers: "Truth has fallen in the public squares, and uprightness cannot
enter" (Is 59:14); "Truth has decayed in the children of men" [Ps 12:1]. But
Pilate did not wait for Christ's answer.

<p>2365 Apropos of this question, note that we find two kinds
of truth in the gospel. One is uncreated and making: this is Christ: "I am the
way, and the truth, and the life" (14:6); the other truth is made, "Grace and
truth came [were made] through Jesus Christ" (1:17).

<p>By its nature truth implies a
conformity between a reality and the intellect. The intellect is related in two
ways to reality. An intellect can be related to things as a measure of these
things; that would be the intellect which is the cause of these things. Another
intellect is measured by things, this would be an intellect whose knowledge is
caused by these things. Now truth is not in the divine intellect because the
intellect is conformed to things, but because things are conformed to the
divine intellect. While truth is in our intellect because it understands
things, conforms to them, as they are. And so uncreated truth and the divine
intellect is a truth which is not measured or made, but a truth which measures
and makes two kinds of truth: one is in the things themselves, insofar as it
makes them so they are in conformity with what they are in the divine
intellect; and it makes the other truth in our souls, and this is a measured
truth, not a measuring truth. Therefore, the uncreated truth of the divine
intellect is appropriated, especially referred, to the Son, who is the very
concept of the divine intellect and the Word of God. For truth is a consequence
of the intellect's concept.<a href="John18.htm#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>

<p>2366 Now, (v 38) we see Pilate's finding in regard to
Christ: first, Pilate states his innocence; secondly, we see his intention to
show mercy (v 39).

<p>2367 Concerning the first, note that Pilate, as Augustine
says, was eager to free Christ.<a href="John18.htm#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>
When he had asked Christ, <b>What is truth? </b>he suddenly realized how he
could free Christ by means of a custom which allowed him to release a prisoner
at the time of the passover. And so, not waiting for an answer to his question,
he decided to make use of this custom to do this. This is why the Evangelist
says about Pilate, <b>After he had said this.</b>

<p>Pilate heard the cries of the Jews,
and thinking that he could calm them and then listen to Christ's answer to this
difficult question under more tranquil conditions, <b>went out to the Jews
again, </b>and declared Christ's innocence, <b>I find no crime in him</b>, that
is, nothing deserving death: "He committed no sin" (1 Pet 2:22). But even if he
did commit a crime, I, who have authority in these matters, and especially the
authority to judge of matters against the state, I wish to free and release
him.

<p>2368 Accordingly he says, <b>But you have a custom that I
should release one man for you at the Passover. </b>First, he offers to release
Christ; secondly, the Evangelist gives the reply of the Jews.

<p>2369 This practice was started by Pilate or some other Roman
governor as a favor to the people. Wishing to free Christ using this custom
Pilate said, <b>Will you have me release for you the King of the Jews? </b>He
did not call him this as if this were a crime, but to heighten their malice. It
was like saying: Even if he is the king of the Jews, which is not your role to
judge, but mine, still, if you want me to, I will release him for you.

<p>2370 The Jews <b>cried out again, Not this man, but
Barabbas! </b>Then to indicate the malice of the Jews, the Evangelist mentions
the crime committed by the one they wanted released, saying, <b>Now Barabbas
was a robber</b>:<b> </b>"Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves"
(Is 1:23). This fulfills the words of Jeremiah (12:8): "My heritage has become
to me like a lion in the forest." "But you denied the Holy and Righteous One
and asked for a murderer to be granted to you" (Acts 3:14).
