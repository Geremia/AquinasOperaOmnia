    Virtue is of two kinds, intellectual and moral. The intellectual is
    generated and fostered for the most part by teaching, and so requires time
    and experience. Moral virtue however is derived from customary action
    (<i>mos</i>). Hence by a slight variation of the original term we have this
    name “moral.”

    From this it is clear that moral virtue is not instilled in us by nature,
    for nothing natural is changed by habit; thus a stone that naturally
    gravitates downward will never become accustomed to moving upward, not even
    if someone should continue to throw it into th air ten thousand times.
    Neither will fire become accustomed to tend downward, nor will anything else
    that naturally tends one way acquire the contrary custom. Therefore, the
    moral virtues are not in us by nature nor are they in us contrary to nature.
    We do have a natural aptitude to acquire them, but we are perfected in these
    virtues by use.

    Again in the things that come to us from nature, we first receive the
    potentialities and afterwards we put them into operation. This is obvious in
    the case of the senses, for we did not acquire our senses from seeing and
    hearing repeatedly but on the contrary we made use of the senses after we
    have them—we did not come into possession of them after we used them.
    Virtues however we acquire by previous activity as happens in different
    arts, for the things we must learn how to make, we learn by making. Thus men
    become builders by building and harpists by playing the harp. Likewise we
    become just by doing just actions, we become temperate by doing temperate
    actions, and we become courageous by doing courageous actions.

    Our contention is verified by what is done in the state, for legislators

    Again, every virtue has both its origin and its deterioration from the same
    principles. A similar situation is found in any art, for it is from playing
    the harp that both good and bad harpists are made. Proportionately this can
    be said of builders and of all the rest. Men become good builders from
    building well, but they become poor builders by building poorly. If this
    were not so, there would be no need of a teacher but all would be born good
    or bad workmen. This is the case also with virtue. Of those who engage in
    transactions with their fellowmen, some become just and others unjust. Of
    those exposed to dangers who habitually experience fear or confidence, some
    become brave and some cowardly. We may say the same of men in reference to
    concupiscence and anger, for some become tmperate and mild, others
    self-indulgent and irascible; some conduct themselves well in these matters,
    others badly. We may then universally state in one sentence: like actions
    produce like habits.

    Therefore, we must cultivate actions of the right sort because differences
    in actions are followed by differences in habits. It is not of small moment

    <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    245. After the Philosopher has treated the questions introductory to virtue,
    he now begins the study of the virtues. He divides the treatise into two
    parts. In the first part [I] he treats the virtues themselves. In the second
    he examines certain things that follow or accompany the virtues. He does
    this in the seventh book (B. 1145 a 15) at “Now, making a new start, we must
    say etc.” [Lect. 1; I]. The first part is subdivided into two sections. In
    the first [I, A] he studies the moral virtues; in the second the
    intellectual virtues, in the sixth book (B.1138 b 18) at “But since we
    previously said etc.” [Lect. 1]. The reason for this order is that the moral
    virtues are more known, and through them we are prepared for a study of the
    intellectual virtues. In the first [A, A’], which is divided into two parts,
    he investigates the matter of the moral virtues in general. In the second
    [Bk. III, Lect. 14] he examines the moral virtues specifically, at “We
    stated previously... is a mean etc.” (B.1115 a 7). This first is again
    subdivided into two parts. In the first of these [A’, 1] he treats moral
    virtue in general. In the second he examines certain principles of moral
    actions. This is in the third book [Lect. 1] beginning at “Since virtue is
    concerned with passions etc.” (B. 1109 b 30). This first has a threefold
    division. In the first part [1, a] he is looking for the cause of moral
    virtue. In the second [Lect. 5] he seeks to find out what moral virtue is,
    at “Now we must search out the definition of virtue” (B. 1105 b 20). In the
    third part [Lect. 11] he shows how a man may become virtuous, at “A
    sufficient explanation has been given etc.” (B. 1109 a 19). On the initial
    point he does three things. First [a, i] he shows that moral virtue is
    caused in us by actions. Second [Lect. 2; a, ii] he shows by what actions it
    may be caused in us, at “The present study etc.” (B.1103 b 27). In the third
    part [Lect. IV] he finds a particular problem in what was previously said,
    at “Someone may rightly ask etc.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    (B.1105 a 18). In regard to the first he does two things. Initially [i, x]
    he shows the cause of the formation of virtue; and second [I, y] what the
    cause of its destruction is, at “Again, every virtue etc.”On the initial
    point he does three things. First [x, aa] he proposes that moral virtue
    originates in us from the habit of acting. Second [x, bb] that mora virtue
    is not in us by nature, at “From this it is clear etc?’ Third [x, cc] he
    explains by a sign what he had said, at “Our contention is ‘verified by what
    is done etc.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    246. He says first that virtue is of two kinds, intellectual and moral, and
    that the intellectual is both generated and increased for the most part by
    teaching. The reason is that intellectual virtue is ordered to knowledge
    which we acquire more readily from teaching than by discovery. More people
    can know the truth by learning form others than by ascertaining it
    themselves. Everyone indeed who finds out from others will learn more than
    he can discover by himself. But because we cannot proceed to in the process
    of learning, men must learn many truths by discovery. Besides, since all our
    knowledge is derived from the senses, and the senses in turn very often
    beget experience, it follows that intellectual virtue may need long
    experience.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    247. But m moral virtue is derived from customary activity. Now moral
    virtue, found in the appetitive part, implies a certain inclination to
    something desirable. This inclination is nature, which tends to what is
    agreeable to itself, or from custom which is transformed into nature. Hence
    the name “moral” differing somewhat from custom is taken from it. In Greek
    <i>ethos</i> spelled with <i>epsilon</i> —a short “e”—means habit or moral
    virtue, while <i>ithos</i> spelled with <i>eta</i> —a long “e”—signifies
    custom. With us also, the name “moral” means custom sometimes and other
    times it is used in relation to vice or virtue.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    248. Then [x, bb], at “From this it is clearly,” he proves from the premises
    that moral virtue is not produced by nature for two reasons. The first [bb,
    a’] is that none of the things from nature are changed by use. He
    illustrates this point by the example of a stone that naturally tending
    downwards will never become accustomed to moving upward, no matter how often
    it is thrown into the air. The reason is that the things which naturally
    operate either merely operate or they operate and are operated upon. If they
    merely operate, their principle of action is not changed. So long as the
    cause remains the same, the inclination to the same effect remains. If,
    however, they so operate as also to be operated upon—unless the passivity be
    such that it removes the principle of action—the natural tendency in them
    will not be destroyed. But if the passivity be such as to take away the
    principle of action, then it will not belong to the same nature. Thus what
    was previously natural will cease to be natural. When a thing operates
    naturally, therefore, no change is effected regarding its action. The same
    is also true if the operation is contrary to nature unless perhaps the
    motion be such that it destroys nature. But if the natural principle of the
    operation remains, there will always be the same action. Therefore, in the
    things that are according to nature and in the things that are contrary to
    nature habit plays no part.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    249. The reason for this is that moral virtue pertains to the appetite that
    operates according as it is moved by the good apprehended. When the appetite
    operates often, therefore, it must be often moved by its object. in this the
    appetite follows a certain tendency in accordance with the mode of nature,
    as many drops of water falling on a rock hollow it out. Thus it is obvious
    that the moral virtues are not in us by nature, nor are they in us contrary
    to nature. We do have a natural aptitude to acquire them inasmuch as the
    appetitive potency is naturally adapted to obey reason. But we are perfected
    in these virtues by use, for when we act repeatedly according to reason, a
    modification is impressed in the appetite by the power of reason. This
    impression is nothing else but moral virtue.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    250. He presents the second reason [bb, b’] at “Again in the in the things.”
    In all the things with which nature has endowed us, potency is previous to
    operation. This is obvious in the senses. We did not receive the sense of
    sight and hearing from seeing and hearing repeatedly. On the contrary, from
    the fact that we had these senses, we began to use them. It did not happen
    that we came into possession of the senses from the fact that we used them.
    But we have acquired the virtues by acting according to virtue, as happens
    in the operative arts in which men learn by making the things that are to be
    made after they have mastered the skill. In this way men become builders by
    building, and harpists by playing the harp. Likewise men become temperate or
    courageous by doing just actions or temperate actions or courageous actions.
    Therefore, virtues of this kind are not in us by nature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    251. Then [x, cc], at “Our contention is verified,” he makes known what he
    had said, by a sign. He says the statement just made that by performing
    actions we become virtuous is verified by what is done in the state.
    Legislators make men virtuous by habituating them to virtuous works by means
    of statutes, rewards and punishment. Such ought to be the aim of every
    legislator—in fact he who does not succeed in this fails in lawmaking. It is
    precisely in this way that a good constitution differs from a bad one.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    252. Then [i, y], at “Again, every virtue,” he shows that virtue is produced
    and destroyed by identical works. First [y, aa] he explains his proposition,
    and second [y, bb] he infers a corollary from what has been said, at
    “Therefore, we must etc.” He says first that the production and the
    destruction of virtue have their source in the same principles taken in a
    different way. The same is true in any art. He shows this first from
    activities, because men become both good and bad harpists—understanding this
    proportionately—from the way they play the harp. A similar reason holds for
    builders and all other workmen. Men become good builders by building well
    repeatedly, they become poor builders by building poorly. If this were not
    so, men would not need to learn arts of this kind from some master workman
    who would direct their actions, but there would be good and bad workmen in
    all the arts no matter how they would be practiced. As it is in the arts, so
    also in the virtues.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    253. Those who act well in their dealings with their fellowmen become just,
    and those who act in an evil way become unjust. Likewise those faced with
    danger who accustom themselves to fear and confidence in the right way
    become courageous; in the wrong way, cowardly. This is true also of
    temperance and meekness in the matter of concupiscence and anger. We may
    then universally sum up in one sentence: like actions produce like habits.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    254. Then [y, bb], at “Therefore, we must,” he affirms that a person must
    give careful attention to the performance of such actions because
    differences in actions are followed by differences in habits. He concludes,
    therefore, it is not of small moment but it makes a great difference—indeed
    everything depends on it—that one becomes accustomed to perform either good
    or evil actions from earliest youth, for we retain longer the things
    impressed on us as children.

        related to the other virtues.

        It must be presupposed that any discussion concerning actions to be
        performed ought to be given in a general way and not definitively. We
        remarked in the beginning that discussions must be pursued according to
        the nature of the subject matter. Now things pertaining to actions, and
        relevant considerations, do not have anything fixed about them any more
        than the things that concern health. If this be true in the general
        treatment, still mor uncertainty will be found in the consideration of
        particular cases. Indeed this study does not fall under either art or
        tradition. But those who perform moral actions must always pay attention
        to what is appropriate to the occasion as is done in medicine and
        navigation. Although this is the situation, we ought to try to be of
        assistance to others in the present study.

        We must then first consider that moral matters are of such a nature as
        to be destroyed by defect and excess. To prove such notions that are not
        readily manifest we must use obvious signs and evidence such as we have
        in the case of bodily strength and health. An excessive amount of
        exercise no less than a lack of it impairs health. Likewise eating and
        drinking too much or too little causes damage to health. But health is
        produced, increased, and preserved by eating and drinking in moderation.
        It is the same then with temperance and fortitude and the other virtues.
        The man who is afraid of everything, who runs away and will endure
        nothing becomes a coward. On the other hand, the man who fears
        absolutely nothing and wades into every danger becomes reckless.
        Likewise a man who tastes every pleasure and passes up none, becomes
        intemperate while he who seeks to avoid all pleasures like a boor
        becomes as it were insensible. Temperance and fortitude are destroyed by
        excess and defect but are preserved by the golden mean.

        Not only the production, increase, and destruction of virtues have
        identical sources and causes but the actions themselves also have the
        same sources and causes. We see this in the more obvious actions like
        bodily strength. A man becomes strong from taking abundant nourishment
        and from hard work. Then when he is strong, he will be more able to do
        these things. We find the same thing in the virtues since we become
        temperate by giving up pleasures, and having become temperate we can b
        very easily give up pleasures. The same is true of the virtue of
        fortitude. We become brave by accustoming ourselves to despise and
        endure terrors, and having become brave we are very capable of enduring
        terrors.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        255. After the Philosopher has shown that virtues are caused in us by
        actions, he now inquires how this is done [ii]. On this point he does
        two things. First [ii, x] he shows what are the actions that cause
        virtue in us. Second [Lect. 3; y], at “We may understand etc.” (B.1104 b
        4), he shows what is the sign of virtue already produced in us. On the
        initial, point he does three things. First [x, aa] he shows the
        necessity of the present investigation. Second [x, bb], at “It must be
        presupposed etc.,” he treats the method of investigation. Third [x, cc]
        he shows actions as causes of virtue. In regard to the first he does two
        things. Initially [aa, a’] he presents the necessity itself. Second [aa,
        b’], at “To be in accord with right reason etc.,” he shows what we must
        suppose here. Regarding the first we must consider that in the
        speculative sciences where we seek only the knowledge of the truth, it
        is sufficient to know what is the cause of a determined effect. But in
        the practical sciences whose end is action, we must know by what
        activities or operations a determined effect follows from a determined
        cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        256. He says then that the present study, moral philosophy, is not
        pursued for the sake of the contemplation of truth like the other
        studies of the speculative sciences, but for the sake of action. In this
        science we seek a definition of virtue not only to know its truth but to
        become good by acquiring virtue. The reason he assigns is that if the
        investigation of this science were for the knowledge of truth alone, it
        would have little utility. It is not of great importance nor does it
        contribute much to the perfection of the intellect that a man should
        know the changeable truth about contingent actions with which virtue is
        concerned. This being the case, he concludes that we must thoroughly
        inquire about the actions we ought to perform because, as we have
        already observed (248-253), actions have influence and control over the
        formation of good and bad habits in us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        257. Then [aa, b’], at “To be in accord with right,” he shows it should
        be taken for granted that actions causing virtue possess the common
        quality of being in accord with right reason. This happens because the
        good of everything consists in the fact that its operation is suited to
        its form. Now the distinctive form of man is that which makes him a
        rational animal. Hence man’s action must be good precisely because it
        harmonizes with right reason, for perversity of reason is repugnant to
        its nature. Later in the sixth book (1109) we shall ascertain what is
        right reason, which belongs to the intellectual virtues, and how it
        pertains to the other virtues, which are the moral.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        258. Then [x, bb], at “It must be,” he explains the method of
        investigating matters of this kind. We must presume, he says, that any
        discussion concerned like this with actions to be performed ought to be
        given in a general way, that is, as a precedent or as, likely, but not
        definitively. This was pointed out in the introduction to the whole work
        (24). The reason is that the discussions are to be carried on according
        to the nature of the subject matter, as was noted in the same place
        (32). We see that things pertaining to moral actions and materials
        useful to them, like external goods, do not have in themselves anything
        fixed by way of necessity, but everything is contingent and changeable.
        The same occurs in works relating to medicine, which are concerned with
        health, because the dis position of the body to be cured and the
        remedies used to effect a cure are changeable in many ways.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        259. The teaching on matters of morals even in their general aspects is
        uncertain and variable. But still more uncertainty is found when we come
        down to the solution of particular cases. This study does not fall under
        either art or tradition because the causes of individual actions are
        infinitely diversified. Hence judgment of particular cases is left to
        the prudence of each one. He who acts prudently must attentively
        consider the things to be done at the present time after all the
        particular circumstances have been taken into consideration. In this way
        a doctor must act in bringing about a cure and a captain in steering a
        ship. Although this doctrine is such as to be uncertain in its general
        aspects and incapable of precision in particular cases, we ought to
        study it so that in these matters we may be of some assistance to men in
        directing their actions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        260. Then [x, cc], at “We must then first,” he shows what are the
        operations that may cause virtue. On this point he does two things.
        First [cc, a’] he shows by what actions virtue is caused. Second [cc,
        b’], at “Not only the production etc.,” he shows that virtue already
        formed produces in turn like actions. He says first we must consider
        before anything else that virtues or operations causing virtues are of
        such a nature as to be destroyed by excess and.defect. To prove this we
        must use certain more obvious signs and evidence, that is, the things
        happening in regard to the powers of the body that are more manifest
        than the capacities of the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        261. We see that bodily strength is impaired by immoderate games, that
        is, certain bodily exercises in which the contestants do battle naked,
        because the natural power of the body is weakened by excessive exertion.
        Likewise the lack of exercise destroys bodily strength because, when not
        exercised, the members remain flabby and incapable of work. A similar
        comment may be made about health. If someone takes either too much food
        or drink, or less than he needs, his health is impaired. But if a man
        uses exercise, food, and drink in moderation, he will become physically
        strong and his health will be improved and preserved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        262. It is the same with the virtues of the soul, for instance,
        fortitude, temperance, and the other virtues. A person who fears
        everything, takes to flight, and never faces anything terrifying becomes
        a coward. Likewise he who fears nothing and wades into every danger
        thoughtlessly becomes rash. The same is true of temperance. He who
        tastes every pleasure and avoids none becomes intemperate. But he who
        avoids all pleasures as a boor does, without any reason, becomes as it
        were insensible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        263. However we are not to conclude from this that virginity, which
        abstains from all venereal pleasure, is a vice. The reason is that
        virginity does not abstain from all pleasures, and that it abstains from
        particular pleasures according to right reason. Similarly, it is not a
        vice for some soldiers to refrain from all venereal pleasure in order to
        devote themselves more fully to fighting. Now these things have been
        said because temperance and fortitude are destroyed by excess and defect
        but are preserved by the golden mean, which is understood not according
        to quantity but according to right reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        264. Then [cc, b’] at “Not only,” he shows that virtue produces actions
        similar to the actions that caused it. He says that the same kinds of
        activity cause the production and increase of virtue, and also its
        destruction if they are taken in a contrary way. Likewise the operations
        of the virtues already produced consist in these same works. This is
        obvious in bodily actions which are more manifest. As bodily strength is
        caused from the fact that a man can take abundant nourishment and can
        work hard, and when he has become strong he will be more able to do
        these things, so also it is with the virtues of the soul. From the fact
        that we give up pleasures, we become temperate; and when we have become
        temperate, we can very easily give up pleasures. It is the same with the
        virtue of fortitude. We become brave by accustoming ourselves to despise
        and endure terrors, and having become brave we are very capable of
        enduring terrors. So also, fire once kindled from generated heat can
        give off intense heat.

        We may understand pleasure or sorrow that follows activity as an
        indication of the habits that are present. Indeed the man who avoids
        bodily pleasures is temperate if he is glad about it; intemperate, if
        sad about it. Likewise, the man who encounters dangers is brave if he
        rejoices or is not sad, but cowardly if he is saddened. Moral virtue
        then is concerned with pleasure and sorrows.

        Furthermore, as we said previously, every habit of the soul has a
        natural disposition to do and to be busied with those things by which it
        is made better and worse. Men become wicked by pursuing the pleasures
        and avoiding the sorrows that are wrong, or by doing this at the wrong
        time or in the wrong manner or in some other way that one may deviate
        from reason. Consequently, some define virtues as certain quiescent and
        emotionless dispositions. But they err in speaking absolutely and in not
        qualifying the passions as to manner, time, and so forth. We must
        suppose therefore that virtue is such that it works what is best

        Our contention will become evident from the following consideration.
        Three things fall under our choice: the good, the useful, the
        pleasurable; and three contrary things we avoid: the evil, th harmful,
        the sorrowful. In regard to all these, the virtuous man disposes himself
        rightly and the vicious man badly. This is especially true in the matter

        As Heraclitus says, it is even more difficult to fight against pleasure
        than anger. Now the more difficult is always treated by art and virtue,

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        265. After the Philosopher has shown what kind of activity produces
        virtue, he now [y] explains how we may recognize virtue already
        produced. On this point he does two things. First [y, aa] he presents
        what he intends to do; and second [y, bb], at “We perform evil actions
        etc.,” he proves his proposition. Regarding the first we must consider
        that when virtue produces actions similar to the actions that formed it,
        as was just noted (264), the performance of this action differs before
        and after virtue. Before virtue man does a kind of violence to himself
        in operating this way. Such actions, therefore, have some admixture of
        sorrow. But after the habit of virtue has been formed, these actions are
        done with pleasure. The explanation is that a habit exists as a sort of
        nature, and that is pleasurable which agrees with a thing according to
        nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        266. He ssays that an indication that habits, good or bad, have already
        been formed is given by the pleasure or sorrow that follows the
        operations. He illustrates this by examples. The man who is glad that he
        has avoided bodily pleasures is temperate because he performs an action
        in keeping with the habit. Likewise, he who encounters dangers with
        pleasure, or at least without sorrow, is brave. Particularly in the act
        of fortitude it is enough not to have sorrow, as will be explained in
        the third book (584-585). One who faces dangers with sorrow is cowardly.
        He then assigns the reason for what he has said from the fact that every
        moral virtue is concerned with pleasures and sorrows.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        267. From this we must not conclude that ever moral virtue is concerned
        with pleasures and sorrows as its proper matter. The matter indeed of
        every moral virtue is that on which reason imposes a norm. Thus justice
        treats of dealing with others, fortitude treats of fears and
        aggressiveness, temperance of certain pleasures. But pleasure is the
        principal end of all the moral virtues, as will be said in the seventh
        book of the present work (1504-1515). In every moral virtue it is
        requisite that a person have joy and sorrow in the things he ought. In
        keeping with this, he says that moral virtue is concerned with pleasures
        and sorrows because the purpose of any moral virtue is that a man be
        rightly ordered in his pleasures and sorrows.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        268. Then [y, bb], at “We perform evil actions,” he proves his
        proposition: first [bb, a’] by reasons taken from things belonging to
        virtue, and second [bb, b’], at “Our contention will etc., by reasons on
        the part of the virtuous man himself. He presents four reasons
        pertaining to the first point. The first reason [a’, a] is taken from
        the inclination of men intent on virtue. It was shown previously
        (264-265) that virtue is produced and destroyed by deeds of the same
        person done in a contrary way. Indeed, we see that virtue is destroyed
        by pleasure and sadness; we perform evil actions out of a desire for
        pleasure, we avoid good or virtuous works because of the sadness we fear
        in honest labor. Hence, as Plato said, one who is intent on virtue
        should have some sort of moral training from his earliest years that he
        may rejoice and be sorrowful about the right things. This is proper
        instruction for youths so that they become accustomed to take pleasure
        in good works and be grieved in evil works. Therefore, teachers of youth
        compliment those who do good deeds and reprove those who do evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        269. At “Besides, if” [a’, b] he presents the second reason based on the
        matter of the moral virtue in the following way. Evry moral virtue deals
        with actions (as justice which treats of buying, selling, and other
        things of this kind), or with passions (as mildness which treats of
        anger), and so with the other virtues. But pleasure or sorrow follows
        every passion that is nothing else but the motion of the appetitive
        power in pursuit of good or in flight from evil. When the good to which
        the appetite tends is forthcoming, therefore, or when the evil which it
        flees is avoided, pleasure follows. But when the contrary happens,
        sorrow follows. Thus the angered man rejoices in getting revenge and
        likewise the cowardly man in avoiding dangers. But when the opposite is
        true, these persons are sorrowful. It remains, therefore, that every
        moral virtue regards pleasures and sorrows as having the aspect of ends.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        270. The third reason presented at “Penalties inflicted” [a’, c] is
        taken from the idea of a remedy for the soul. As a medicine used for the
        restoration of health is a kind of disagreeable potion from which the
        sweetness has been removed, so a penalty used for the restoration of
        virtue is a kind of medicine, for a penalty consists in taking away
        certain pleasures or applying certain disagreeable things. The reason
        for this is that a medicine is naturally to be used as a contrary thing.
        Thus in the case of fever doctors apply cooling remedies. Hence moral
        virtue also is concerned with certain pleasures and sorrows.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        271. At “Furthermore, as [a’, d] he presents the fourth reason, which.
        is taken from what is contrary to and destructive of virtue. Every
        habit, he says, has a disposition to do and to be busied with the things
        by which it is made worse and better, that is, by which the goodness of
        a good habit and the evil of a bad habit is increased. This can be
        understood likewise of the things by which the habit naturally becomes
        worse or better, that is, by which it naturally is formed or increased
        (which is to be made better), or destroyed or diminished (which is to be
        made worse). We see that men become evil through the deterioration of
        virtue from the fact that they pursue the pleasures and steer clear of
        the sorrows which they ought not, or when they ought not, or in some
        other way by which one may deviate from right reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        272. The Stoics took occasion of this to say that virtues are certain
        quiescent and passionless dispositions. The reason was that they saw men
        become evil through pleasures and sorrows, and consequently they though
        that virtue consists in the total cessation of the changes of the
        passions. But in this they erred wishing to exclude entirely the
        passions of the soul from a virtuous man. It belongs, of course, to the
        good of reason to regulate the sensitive appetite—and the passions are
        movements of this appetite. Hence it is not the business of virtue to
        exclude all, but only the inordinate passions, that is, those which are
        not as they ought to be and aare not at the time the ought to be (he
        adds also all the other things belonging to the remaining
        circumstances). From this he then concludes that we must suppose that
        virtue should work what is best regarding pleasures and sorrows but
        vice, which is the habit opposed to virtue should work what is evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        273. Then [bb, b] at “Our contention will” he introduces to his
        proposition four other reasons taken on the part of men in whom virtue,
        pleasure, and sorrow are found. The first reason [b’, a] is derived from
        pleasures in general. He says that three things fall under human choice:
        the good or virtuous, the helpful or useful, and the pleasurable.
        Contrary to these are also three things: evil or vice as opposed to the
        virtuous, the harmful as opposed to the useful, the sorrowful as opposed
        to the pleasurable. In regard to all these, the virtuous man disposes
        himself rightly but the vicious man badly, especially in the matter of
        pleasure, which is more common among the things mentioned since it
        belongs to two of them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        274. First in regard to the things partaking of pleasure. Pleasure is
        found in all animals since it is not only in the intellectual power but
        also in the sensitive power. The useful and the virtuous, however,
        pertain to the intellectual power alone. This is so because the virtuous
        act is performed in, accord with reason while the useful implies an
        order of one to another, and “to order” is proper to reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        275. Another common feature is on the part of the things themselves in
        which pleasure is gained. Pleasure, in fact, follows everything that
        falls under choice. Now the virtuous is pleasurable to man because it is
        agreeable to reason, and the useful also gives pleasure by reason of the
        expected benefit. But, on the other hand, not every pleasurable action
        is useful or virtuous, as is obvious in the pleasures of sense.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        276. At “Pleasure, too” [b’, b] he presents the second reason, which is
        taken from an inherent characteristic of pleasure. Pleasure has grown up
        with us all alike from childhood, since a newborn child delights in his
        milk. Therefore, it is difficult for man to curb this passion acquired
        with life because it starts in man at the beginning of life. Hence moral
        virtue is especially concerned with pleasure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        277. He assigns the third reason at “Some regulate” [b’, c]. This reason
        is derived from man’s inclination. All men regulate their activities by
        pleasure and sorrow. They are intent on activities they find pleasant
        and they avoid activities they find distressing. Hence the whole
        business of a moral virtue, which is ordered to good activity, must
        concern pleasure and sorrow. It is quite important to note what
        activities one finds pleasant or painful, whether rightly or wrongly so.
        The reason is that he who rejoices in good performs good actions, but he
        who rejoices in evil performs evil actions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        278. He assigns the fourth reason at “As Heraclitus says” [b’, d]. This
        is taken from a comparison with anger. It is more difficult, as
        Heraclitus said, to fight against pleasure than against anger, even
        though it seems most difficult to fight against anger because of its
        vehemence. But the desire of pleasure is both more common and more
        natural, and besides, it lasts longer. Art and virtue however always
        treat of the more difficult, for anyone can operate well in the easier
        things. But it takes one skilled in virtue and art to operate well in
        difficult things. Thus it is obvious, from what has been said, that the
        whole business of virtue and of political science or of public affairs
        is concerned with pleasures and sorrows. If a man uses these well he
        will be virtuous, but if he uses them badly he will be evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        279. Then [y, cc], at “It has been said that,” he sums up in conclusion
        the points that have been made: virtue is concerned with pleasures and
        sorrows; virtue is produced and increased by the same actions that, when
        done in the opposite way, destroy virtue; the same actions producing
        virtue are in turn produced by virtue once formed.

        Someone may rightly ask how we can say that man must become just by

        perform just and temperate works they are already just and temperate, as
        those who produce grammatical or musical works are already grammarians

        But this is not true in the arts. A man may at times produce something
        grammatical by chance or with the help of another. He will therefore be
        a grammarian only if he produces a grammatical work in a grammatical
        way, that is, in accordance with the science of grammar that he

        Another dissimilarity between the arts and virtues is that works of art
        have their perfection in themselves. It is enough then that these be
        made with certain qualities. Yet works of virtue are not justly and
        temperately performed if they have certain qualities, but the agent
        performing them must fulfill the following conditions. (1) He must know
        what he is doing. (2) He must choose th virtuous works for thier own
        sakes. (3) He must possess the disposition and operate according to it
        resolutely and with stability. Except for knowledge, these conditions
        are not required in the other arts. Mere knowledge, however,has little
        or no importance to he virtues but what occurs form the frequent
        performance of just and temperate actions is all important.

        Works then are called just and temperate when they are such as a just

        perform them.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        280. After the Philosopher has shown that virtues are caused by actions,
        he now raises a doubt about this assertion. Regarding it he does three
        things. First [A] he presents a problem. Second [B], at “But this is not
        true etc.,” he solves it. Third [C], from the discussion of the question
        he comes to the conclusion principally intended, at “It has been well
        said, therefore, etc.” The doubt that he first raises is this. What is
        true of virtue is true of art. But in art it is true that no one
        produces a work of art except one who possesses the art, as no one
        produces anything grammatical unless he is a grammarian, nor anything
        musical unless he be a musician. It will be true in virtue, therefore,
        that whoever performs just works is already just and whoever performs
        temperate works is already temperate. Hence our previous contention
        (164) does not seem to be true, that men become just by doing just
        actions and temperate by doing temperate actions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        28t. Then [B, 1], at “But this is not” he solves this doubt first by
        rejecting what was assumed about art and second [B, 2] by disproving the
        likeness said to exist between virtue and art, at “Another dissimilarity
        etc.” He says first that it is not true in art, as was assumed, that
        whoever produces a grammatical work is already a grammarian. It happens
        sometimes that an ignoramus by chance pronounces a word correctly.
        Sometimes this happens with the help of another whose example is
        followed, for instance, a mimic imitates the correct pronunciation given
        by a grammarian. But a man is to be judged a grammarian only when he
        produces a grammatical work and in a grammatical way, that i&amp;, in
        accord with the science of grammar that he possesses.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        282. Then [B, 2], at “Another dissimilarity” he gives the second
        solution, in two steps. First [2, a] he eliminates the likeness between
        art and virtue. Second [2, b] he concludes the solution at “Works then
        are called just etc.” He says first that there is no similarity in art
        and virtue since works of art have in themselves what belongs to the
        perfection of the art. The explanation is that art is the right plan of
        making things, as will be said in the sixth book of the present work
        (1153, 1160, 1166). “Making” is an operation that passes to external
        matter, and an operation of this kind is a perfection of the thing made.
        Hence in such actions the good consists in the object made. It is enough
        for the good of art, therefore, that the things made be good. But
        virtues are principles of actions that do not go out into external
        matter but remain in the agents. Hence actions of this kind are
        perfections of the agents. So the good of these actions is identical
        with the agents themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        283. He says, therefore, in order that actions be justly and temperately
        performed, it is not enough that the things done be good but the agent
        must work in a proper manner. Regarding this manner, he says we must pay
        attention to three things. (i) The first, pertaining to the intellect or
        reason, is that one who performs a virtuous action should not act in
        ignorance or by chance but should know what he is doing. (2) The second
        is taken on the part of the appetitive power. Here two things are noted.
        One is that the action be not done out of passion, as happens when a
        person performs a virtuous deed because of fear. But the action i,
        should be done by a choice that is not made for the sake of something
        else, as happens when a person performs a good action for money or
        vainglory. The actions should be done for the sake of the virtuous work
        itself which, as something agreeable, is inherently pleasing to him who
        has the habit of virtue. (3) The third, taken from the nature of a
        habit, is that a person should possess a virtuous choice and operate
        according to it resolutely—that is, consistently on his part—and with
        stability so as not to be moved by any external thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        284. Only the first of these, knowledge, is required in the arts. A man
        can be a good artist even if he never chooses to work according to art
        and does not persevere in his work. But knowledge has little or no
        importance in a person being virtuous, but his goodness consists
        entirely in other things that take place within him by frequent actions,
        and thus he becomes stable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        285. Then [2, b], at “Works then,” he concludes the solution of the
        abovementioned doubt. He states that things done are called just and
        temperate because they are similar to the things that a just and
        temperate man does. Whoever performs these actions need not necessarily
        be just and temperate, but he who performs them as just and temperate
        men perform them according to the three conditions just laid down is
        said to be just and temperate. Men, therefore, first perform just and
        temperate actions-not in the same way as the just and temperate do-and
        such actions in their turn produce the habit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        286. If it should be asked how this is possible, since nothing can move
        itself from potency to act, we must answer that the perfection of moral
        virtue, which we are treating, consists in reason’s control of the
        appetite. Now, the first principles of reason, no less in moral than in
        speculative matters, have been given by nature. Therefore, just as by
        means of previously known principles a man makes himself actually
        understand by personal effort of discovery, so also by acting according
        to the principles of practical reason a man makes himself actually
        virtuous.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        287. Then [C], at “It has been well said, therefore,” he comes to the
        conclusion principally intended. First [C, 1 ] he brings his proposition
        to an end; and second [C, 2], at “Many, however, fail etc.,” he
        discredits a false opinion of certain persons. He concludes that it has
        been well said above (264, 280) that a man becomes just by doing just
        actions and temperate by doing temperate actions. But he who does not
        perform actions nor develop his disposition will never become virtuous.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        288. Then [C, 2], at “Many, however” he discredits the false opinion of
        certain persons who do not perform works of virtues but, by taking
        refuge in the discussion of virtues, think they can become virtuous by
        philosophizing. Such people, he says, are like the sick who carefully
        listen to what the doctor has to say but do nothing about carrying out
        his prescriptions. Thus philosophy is to the cure of the soul what
        medicine is to the cure of the body. Hence, as those who listen to the
        advice of doctors and disregard it will never have a well regulated
        body, so those who listen to the warnings of moral philosophers and do
        not heed them will never have a well regulated soul.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        289. After the Philosopher has treated the cause of virtue, he now
        begins to investigate the definition of virtue. He divides the
        investigation into two parts. In the first [I] he shows what virtue is,
        and in the second [Lect. 10] he ascertains the opposition of virtue to
        vice at “There are three etc.” (B. 1108 b 11). The first part is treated
        under two headings. In the first [I, A] he determines what virtue is in
        general. In the second [Lect. 8] he applies the adopted definition to
        particular virtues, at “We must speak of virtue not only under its
        universal aspect” (B.1107 a 28). This first section is also twofold, and
        in the first of these [A, A’] he investigates the definition of virtue.
        In the second [Lect. 7; 1] he concludes the definition, at “Virtue then
        is a habit etc.” (B. 1107). On the first point he first [A’, 1]
        investigates the genus of virtue and second [Lect. 6] its specific
        difference, at “We must consider not only etc.” (B. 1106 a 16). He
        investigates the genus by parts. Hence, regarding the first he does
        three things. First [1, a] he offers the division. Second [1, b], at “By
        passions I mean etc.,” he explains its parts. Third [1, c], at “Neither
        virtues nor vices,” he argues from the accepted definition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        290. He says first that to establish the definition of virtue we have to
        take for granted three principles in ‘the soul: passions, powers, and
        habits. Virtue must come under one of these, for he just said (282) that
        virtue is a principle of certain operations of the soul. Now no
        principle of operation is found in the soul outside these three.
        Sometimes a man seems to act from passion, for example, anger; sometimes
        from habit, as when he works by art; sometimes from mere potentiality,
        as when he begins a new activity. It is obvious that not absolutely
        everything in the soul is included under this division—the essence of
        the soul and the operation of the intellect do not belong here—but only
        the things that are principles of some operation are considered.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        291. Then [1, b]; at “By passions I mean,” he indicates the members of
        the division just mentioned. First [b, i] he makes known those that are
        passions; second [b, ii], those that are powers, at “I call those
        principles powers etc.”; third [b, iii], those that are habits, at “I
        call those principles habits etc.” Regarding the first we must consider
        that passions are not attributed to the vegetative soul because the
        powers of this part of the soul are not passive, as they are in both the
        sensitive part and the intellective part, but active. The perceptive and
        appetitive powers, except the active intellect, are passive. Although
        feeling and understanding are in a way passions (i.e., they “suffer”
        change, passions are properly denominated not because of the
        apprehension of sense or intellect but only because of the appetite. The
        reason is that the operation of the perceptive power takes place
        according as the thing perceived is in the knower according to the state
        of the knower. Now the object perceived is, so to speak, drawn to the
        knower. But the operation of the appetitive power takes place according
        as the one desiring is inclined to the thing desired. Because it is
        characteristic of the recipient (<i>patientis</i>) that he be drawn by
        the agent, and not the converse, it follows that only the operations of
        the appetitive powers, but not the operations of the perceptive powers,
        are called passions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        292. Even among the appetitive powers the operation of the intellective
        appetite is not properly called passion. It does not take place with a
        change of a bodily organ, which is necessary to the nature of a passion
        properly speaking. Also in the operation of the intellective appetite,
        which is the will, man is not the passive recipient, but rather he
        directs himself as the master of his action. It remains, therefore, that
        operations of the sensitive appetite, which are accompanied by a change
        of a bodily organ and which in a way draw man, should be called passions
        in a strict sense.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        293. The sensitive appetite is divided into two powers: (1) the
        concupiscible, which concerns sensible good absolutely (this is
        pleasurable to sense) and evil contrary to it; (2) the irascible, which
        concerns good under the aspect of a certain eminence. For example,
        victory is said to be a kind of good, although it is not accompanied by
        pleasure of sense. Whatever passions concern good or evil absolutely,
        therefore, are found in the concupiscible appetite. Certain of
        these-three in number-regard the good: love (which implies a certain
        connaturality of the appetite with the good loved), desire (which
        implies a movement of the appetite towards the good loved), and delight
        (which implies a repose of the appetite in the good loved). Opposed to
        these in respect to evil are: hatred to love, aversion or flight to
        desire, sadness to delight. But those passions that concern good or evil
        under the aspect of difficulty belong to the irascible, as fear and
        boldness in regard to evil, hope and despair in regard to good. A fifth
        is anger, which is a composite passion and so has no opposite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        294. In enumerating the passions, therefore,. he says they are:
        concupiscence (which we call desire), anger, fear, boldness, envy (which
        is contained under sadness), and joy (which is contained under pleasure)
        for this is a non-corporeal pleasure that consists in an interior
        perception of the good, and likewise a love, hatred, and desire of the
        same interior kind. Desire differs from concupiscence in that
        concupiscence pertains to bodily pleasure while desire concerns every
        pleasure without distinction.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        295. He adds jealousy and pity, which are species of sadness. Pity is
        sadness at another’s misfortune, and jealousy is sadness because one
        lacks what others have.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        296. He also adds that pleasure and sorrow universally follow the
        abovementioned passions, because all others imply certain movements to
        good and evil, and these movements are accompanied by pleasure or
        sorrow. Hence all other passions are terminated at pleasure and sorrow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        297. Then [b, ii], at “I call those principles powers,” he identifies
        the powers not in general but those pertaining to moral study precisely
        as they differ from the passions. He affirms that powers are said to
        exist according as we are considered capable of experiencing these
        passions, that is, the powers are said to “suffer” or to receive these
        passions. Thus the irascible power exists according as we are capable of
        becoming angry and the concupiscible power according as we are capable
        of becoming sad or showing pity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        298. Then [b, iii], at “I call those principles habits,” he identifies
        the habits. Likewise this is not done in general but in regard to those
        pertaining to moral study by comparison with the passions. Habits, he
        states, are said to exist according as we consistently use the passions
        well or badly. Now a habit is a disposition determining a power in
        reference to something. When the determination is made conformable to
        the nature of the thing, there will be a good habit which disposes that
        a thing be done well, Otherwise there will be a bad habit according to
        which a thing will be done badly. He illustrates what we do according to
        habit, how we may be angry either wrongly-when this is done in a violent
        or weak manner, that is, according to excess or defector well if done
        with moderation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        299. Then [1, c], at “Therefore neither virtues,” he argues from the
        division previously given, First [c, i] he shows that virtues are not
        passions. Second [c, ii], at “For this reason also etc.,” he shows that
        they are not powers. Third [c, iii], at “If then virtues etc.,” he
        concludes they are habits. For the first statement he assigns four
        reasons. The first is this [i, w]. We are called good according to
        virtues and evil according to the opposite vices. But we are not called
        good or evil according to passions taken absolutely. Passions,
        therefore, are neither virtues nor vices.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        300. He presents the second reason at “We are neither” [i, x]. It is
        taken from praise and reproach, which are kinds of attestation of
        goodness and evil. He says that we are praised for virtues and
        reproached for the opposite vices. But we are neither praised nor
        reproached for the passions taken absolutely. A man is not praised or
        blamed because he is simply afraid or angry but only because he is
        afraid or angry in a particular way, that is, according to reason or
        contrary to reason. The same must be understood of the other passions of
        the soul. The passions of the soul, therefore, are neither virtues nor
        vices.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        301. At “We become angry” [i, y] he presents the third reason, which is
        taken from a virtuous manner of acting. Virtues are either choices or
        not without choice, for the very act of virtue can be called virtue. If
        we consider the principal acts of virtues, which are interior, virtue is
        choice; but if we consider the exterior acts, virtue is not without
        choice because the exterior acts of virtue proceed from interior choice.
        If virtue be taken as the very habit of virtue, even in this sense it
        does not lack choice, as a cause is not without its proper effect. The
        passions, however, come to us without choice because they precede the
        deliberations of the reason necessary for choice. This is what he means
        saying that we are angry and are afraid without willing it, that is, not
        by choice of the reason. The passions, therefore, are not virtues.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        302. He presents the fourth reason at “We are said” [i, z]. This is
        taken from the very nature of virtue. The passions are movements
        according to which we are said to be moved. The virtues and vices are
        qualities according to which we are said not to be moved but to be
        disposed in some way, whether well or badly that our movement may ensue.
        The passions, therefore, are neither virtues nor vices.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        303. Then [c, ii], at “For this reason,” he shows that virtues are not
        powers for two reasons. The first of these [ii, x] is taken from the
        nature of good and evil, as has just been proved (299-300) about the
        passions. The reason is this. No one is called good or evil, no one is
        praised or reproached, because he is capable of being affected by some
        passion-for instance, that he is capable of becoming angry or being
        afraid. But we are called good or evil and are praised or reproached
        because of virtues and vices. Virtues and vices, therefore, are not
        powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        304. He gives the second reason at “Furthermore, the powers” [ii, y]. It
        is taken on the part of the cause and is this. Powers are in us by
        nature because they are natural characteristics of the soul. But virtues
        and vices by which we are called good or evil are not in us by nature,
        as was proved above (248-251). Virtues and vices, therefore, are not
        powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        305. Then [c, iii], at “If then,” he concludes his proposition. If
        virtues are neither passions nor, powers, it remains that they are
        habits according to the previously given division. Thus he concludes
        that virtue with regard to its generic definition obviously is a habit.

        We must explain, therefore, that virtue perfects everything of which it,
        is the virtue, rendering both the possessor good and his work good. Thus
        the virtue or power of the eye makes good both the eye and its
        operation, for it is by the power of the eye that we see well. Likewise
        the virtue or excellence of a horse makes the horse good and also makes
        him good for running, riding and awaiting the enemy. If this be true in
        all other things, then human virtue will be a habit making man good and
        rendering his work good.

        mean and executing the work according to the mean. Hence it is customary
        to tell a man who has done a good piece of work that nothing is to be
        added or taken away, meaning that excess and defect disfigure a work but
        the mean preserves it. As we have said, good workmen work with an eye on
        the mean. But virtue like nature is more certain and better than art.
        Virtue then will aim at the mean.

        I am speaking of moral virtue, for it treats of passions and operations
        in which we find excess, defect, and the mean. Thus aggressiveness,
        fear, concupiscence, aversion, anger, pity, and, in general, pleasure
        and sorrow take place with excess and defect. Both of these are evil;
        but to experience these passions at the right time, for the right
        objects, toward the right persons, with the right motive, and in the
        right way is the mean and the highest good of virtue. Similarly, excess,
        defect, and the mean are to be found in actions. Now moral virtue is
        concerned with passions and operations in which excess is vicious,
        defect is reproachable, and the mean receives praise and shows the right
        path. These two (praise and righteousness) pertain to virtue. Moral
        virtue, therefore, is a kind of middle course and aims at the mean.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        306. After the Philosopher has explained, the genus of virtue, he now
        begins an inquiry into the specific difference of virtue. First [I] he
        presents his proposition. He says that in order to know what virtue is
        we must consider not only that it is a habit—thus the genus is
        understood, but what kind of habit—thus the specific difference is
        indicated.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        307. Second [II], at “We must explain, therefore,” he makes known the
        proposition. On this point he does two things. First [II, A] he
        manifests a certain common quality of virtue. Second [II, B], from this
        quality of virtue he explains its specific difference, at “How this
        etc.” He says first that every virtue makes its possessor good and his
        work good. Thus the virtue or power of the eye makes the eye good and
        gives us good sight, which is the proper function of the eye. Likewise
        the virtue or excellence of a horse makes a horse good and makes it
        perform well, that is, run fast, ride easily, and fearlessly await the
        enemy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        308. The reason is that the virtue or power of a thing is judged by the
        best it can do. For example, the power of one who can carry a hundred
        pounds is determined by his actual carrying of this weight, as is said
        in the first book <i>De Coelo</i> (Ch. II, 281 a 8; St. Th. Lect. 25,
        249) and not by the fact that he carries fifty pounds. Now the utmost or
        best to which the power of anything extends is called its excellent
        performance. It belongs to the virtue of every thing, therefore, to
        render an excellent performance. Because a perfect operation proceeds
        only from a perfect agent, it follows that everything is both good and
        operates well according to its own virtue. If this be true in all other
        things—and such was already apparent from our examples—human virtue must
        be a kind of habit, as was mentioned above (305). From this habit man
        becomes good formally speaking (as one becomes white by whiteness) and
        operates well.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        309. Then [II, B], at “How this,” he investigates the specific
        difference of virtue according to the quality of virtue previously
        indicated. He does this under three headings: first [B, A’] according to
        the property of the operations; second [B, B’], according to the nature
        of virtue, At “but it will become still clearer etc.”; third [Lect. 7;
        C’] according to the special character of good or evil, at “Moreover,
        there are many etc.” (B.1106 b 29). He says first that the way in which
        a man may become good and do good has been treated already (257). It was
        noted also (260-264) that we are made good in every virtue by operations
        according to the mean. Then having become good we perform good actions.
        It remains, therefore, that if virtue makes a man good and his work
        good, it will consist in the mean.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        310. Then [B, B’], at “but it will become etc.,” he proves the same by
        the nature of virtue. Regarding this he does three things. First [B’, 1]
        he introduces certain preliminaries necessary to explain his
        proposition. Second [B’, 2], he concludes his proposition at “Every
        practical science then etc.” Third [B’, 3], he explains an inference at
        “I am speaking of moral virtue etc.” On the first point he does two
        things. First [1, a] he proposes the things necessary to elucidate the
        proposition. Second [1, b] he clarifies what he has said, at “By the
        mean on the part etc.” He says first that the manner in which we become
        good and perform good acts will be clearer still if we consider the
        nature of virtue. For an understanding of this, we must take for granted
        beforehand that virtue treats three things: the more, the less, and the
        equal. Virtue treats these both in continuous, contingent matters, and
        even in any other divisible matter, whether it be numerically divided as
        all discrete things, or whether it be divided incidentally—for example,
        by intensity and indistinctness of a quality in a subject. These three
        are so arranged that the equal holds a middle place between the more,
        which pertains to excess, and the less, which pertains to defect. This
        can be understood in two ways: one according to absolute quantity in
        some thing and the other in relation to us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        311. Then [1, b], at “By the mean on the part of the thing,” he
        clarifies what he said about the difference on the part of the thing
        (objective) and in regard to us (relative): first [b, i] by means of
        reason, and second [b, ii] by way of example at “For example, if etc.”
        He says first that the objective mean is the point equidistant from both
        extremes. It is the same for all because it is understood according to
        the absolute quantity of the thing. But the mean is relative in regard
        to us inasmuch as it neither exceeds nor falls short of a proportion
        suitable to us. Hence this mean is not the same for all. If we apply the
        relative mean to a shoe, it will not be more than the length of the foot
        nor less. It will not be the same for all because not all have the same
        size foot.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        312. Then [b, ii], at “For example, if,” he clarifies what he has said,
        by way of example: first [ii, x] regarding the objective mean which is
        equally distant from the extremes. Thus six is the mean between ten
        (which is the more) and two (which is the less) because six is less than
        ten and more than two by the same amount, four. The mean, which is taken
        in numbers from the equal distance between two extremes, is said to be
        according to arithmetic proportion which considers numerical quantity.
        But the mean, which is taken from the equality of proportion in regard
        to us, is said to be according to the geometric proportion as will be
        made clear afterwards in the fifth book (944, 949, 950, 972).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        313. Second [ii, y], at “But the mean in regard to us,” he gives
        examples of the mean. He says that the mean, which is understood in
        comparison with us, is not to be taken according to equal distance
        between extremes. This is sufficiently clear in the previous example of
        the shoe. If a shoe twenty fingers’ breadth is long and a shoe four
        fingers’ breadth is short it does not necessarily follow that one twelve
        fingers’ breadth will be the right fit. Perhaps it will be large
        compared to the foot of one person and small compared to the foot of
        another. He also exemplifies this mean in food. If eating ten pounds or
        ten portions is much and eating two pounds is little, a trainer—whose
        duty it is to make out someone’s diet—should not for this reason
        prescribe six pounds, since even this is much for one person and little
        for another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        314. This would indeed be little for a man called Milo who, according to
        Solinus, ate a whole beef in a day. But it would be much for a champion
        in gymnastics, for one who has to excel in sports—in which men used to
        contend naked—and must eat lightly to be in better condition. The same
        is true of those who run at the stadium and of those who take up
        wrestling—a sport engaged in by the Greeks for exercise. So it is also
        in every operative science. The wise man avoids excess and defect, and
        wants to find the mean not objectively but relative to us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        315. Then [B’, 2], at “Every practical science,” he argues from the
        premises in this way. Every operative science perfects its work in this:
        that in planning it aims for the mean, and in execution it carries out
        its work in accord with the mean. Indications of this can be had from
        the fact that men are in the habit of saying, when a work is well done,
        that not a thing is to be added nor taken away. Thus they give us to
        understand that excess and defect spoil a work which is preserved by the
        mean. Hence good workmen, as has been pointed out (313-314), work with
        an eye on the mean. But virtue like nature is more certain and even
        better than any art. Moral virtue operates by inclining in a determined
        way to one thing as nature does. Indeed custom becomes nature. But art,
        which operates according to reason, is indifferent to various objects.
        Hence like nature it is more certain than art.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        316. Likewise virtue is better than art because by art a man is capable
        of doing a good work, but art does not cause him to do the good work. He
        can do a bad work because art does not incline to the good use of art; a
        grammarian for example can speak incorrectly. But by virtue a man not
        only is capable of operating but actually performs the action because
        virtue like nature inclines to a good operation. Art alone gives only
        the knowledge of the operation. Consequently even for this secondary
        reason virtue, which is better than art, aims at the mean.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        317. Then [ B’, 3], at “I am speaking,” he explains a further
        conclusion. He affirms that what has been said (256-263) ought to be
        understood of moral virtue that concerns passions and operations to
        which belong excess, defect and mean. He gives an example first from the
        passions saying that fear, aggressiveness, concupiscence, aversion
        (which is a fleeing from something), anger, pity, and any Pleasure and
        sorrow may happen in greater and less degree than they ought. Both the
        excess and the defect are evil. But if a man should fear and dare (so of
        the other passions) what he ought, in the things he ought, in regard to
        the persons he ought, for the motive he ought, and in the way he ought,
        this will be a mean for the passions. It will be also the highest good
        of virtue. Similarly excess, defect, and mean are found in actions.
        Moral virtue treats of passions and actions as its proper matter so that
        in them excess is vicious and defect worthy of reproach, but the mean
        receives praise and shows the right path. These two pertain to virtue:
        righteousness (which is opposed to vicious perverseness) and praise
        (which is opposed to reproach). This and vicious perverseness follow
        from the first two (excess and defect).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        318. Thus he concludes that moral virtue considered in itself is a kind
        of middle course and is an indicator of the mean inasmuch as it aims at
        the mean and accomplishes it.

        Moreover, there are many ways of sinning (for evil partakes of the
        unlimited in the opinion of the Pythagoreans, and good partakes of the
        limited). However, there is only one way of doing what is right. It is
        easy to sin, therefore, but difficult to do what is right. It is easy
        indeed to miss a bull’s eye but difficult to hit it. For this reason

        Not every action or passion of the soul admits a mean. Certain ones
        imply vice by their very name: passions such as ill-will, shamelessness,

        An excess and defect are not found in temperance and fortitude because a
        mean is in no way an extreme, so excess or defect cannot be the mean of
        vice but what is done is vicious. As a consequence there cannot be a
        mean in any excess or defect, nor can there be excess or defect in any
        mean.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        319. After giving the two previous reasons, the Philosopher now [C’]
        adds a third based upon the nature of good and evil. Accepting the
        Pythagorean view, he says that there are many ways of sinning because
        evil, which is included in the nature of sin, partakes of the unlimited,
        but good partakes of the limited. We must understand then, on the
        contrary, that there is only one way of doing what is right.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        320. The reason for this can be found in the statement of Dionysius in
        the book <i>De Divinis Nominibus</i>, that good results from a united
        and complete cause but evil from any single defect, as is evident in
        physical goodness and badness. Ugliness, which is a defect of physical
        beauty, results from any member being unsightly. But beauty arises only
        when all the members are well proportioned and of a healthy hue.
        Likewise sickness, a defect in the constitution of the body, happens
        from a single disorder of any humor. But health is dependent on the
        proper proportion of all the humors. Likewise sin is committed in human
        action from any circumstance being inordinate in any way either by
        excess or defect. But goodness will be present only when all the
        circumstances are rightly ordered. As health or beauty comes about in a
        single way but sickness and ugliness in many, even in an unlimited
        number of ways, so also moral goodness results in only one way but the
        act of sin takes place in countless ways. Hence it is easy to sin
        because sin can happen in a variety of modes, but it is difficult to do
        what is right because rectitude happens only in one way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        321. He gives as an example that it is easy to miss the center of the
        target, because a miss can happen in numerous ways. But to hit the
        center spot is difficult because a hit happens in only one way. Now it
        is obvious that excess and defect take place in various ways but the
        mean in a single way. Hence excess and defect manifestly pertain to vice
        but the mean to virtue because men are good simply, that is, in one way,
        but evil at sundry times, i.e., in many ways as has just been stated
        (320).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        322. Then [D’], at “Virtue then is,” he infers the definition of virtue
        from the premises. First [D’, 1] he presents the definition, and second
        [D’, 2] he explains it, at “Virtue is a mean between two etc.” Third
        [D’, 3] he rejects an error, at “Not every action etc.” In the
        definition of virtue he treats four points. The first of these is the
        genus, which he touches on when he says that virtue is a habit (305).
        The second is the act of the moral virtue, for the habit must be defined
        by the act. This he mentions by the word “chooses,” that is, acts
        according to choice, for the principal act of virtue is choice—he will
        discuss this later (432). Since the act must be determined by the object
        he refers then, third, to the object or the term of the action when he
        says “the mean in regard to us.” It was shown above (314) that virtue
        seeks out and uses the mean not of the thing but in regard to us.
        Similarly it has been said (257) that moral virtue is in the appetite,
        which participates in reason. He had to add, therefore, a fourth notion,
        which refers to the cause of goodness in virtue, by the words determined
        by reason.” It is good to seek the mean only insofar as, it is
        determined by reason, but because reason can be right or erring, we must
        perform virtue according to right reason, as was ascertained previously
        (257).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        323. To explain this he adds “as understood by a wise man.” “Wise” here
        does not refer to one who is wise simply, knowing the ultimate causes of
        the whole universe, but rather to one who is prudent, that is, wise in
        human affairs, but this he will discuss in the sixth book (1163).
        Certainly the making of what is good in the art of building is
        determined by the judgment of one wise in that art, and the same is true
        in all the other arts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        324. Then [D’, 2], at “Virtue is a mean,” he explains the previously
        given definition in regard to his saying that virtue consists in the
        mean. On this point he does three things. First [2, a] he shows between
        what things there is a mean and, second [2, b], in reference to what
        thing- this mean may be considered, at “In regard to this etc.” Third
        [2, c] he deduces a corollary at “For this reason virtue etc.” He says
        first that virtue itself is a kind of middle course between two vices
        and between two vicious habits: one by way of excess and the other by
        way of defect. Thus liberality is the middle course between extravagance
        tending toward excess and miserliness tending toward avarice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        325. Then [2, b], at “In regard to this,” he shows in reference to what
        norm we are to judge excess, defect, and mean. He says we must further
        consider that some vices fall short of but others exceed, both in the
        passions and in actions, what is right. In regard to this some are
        deficient and others are in excess. But virtue, precisely as it observes
        what it ought, is said to discover the mean by reason and to choose it
        by the will. Thus it is evident that virtue itself is a middle course
        and, on the other hand, it employs the mean. It is indeed the middle
        course between two habits, but it uses the mean in actions and passions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        326. Then [2, c], at “For this reason,” he draws a further conclusion
        from his remarks: that virtue in its essence and definition is a mean.
        But precisely as it possesses the character of the best and as it acts
        or guides well in a determined genus it is an extreme. For an
        understanding of this, we must consider (as has been pointed out in
        322), that the entire goodness of moral virtue depends on the rectitude
        of the reason. Hence good is in harmony with moral virtue according as
        it follows right reason, but evil has a reference to each vice, viz.:
        excess and defect inasmuch as both depart from right reason. Therefore,
        according to the nature of goodness and evil both vices are in one
        extreme that is, in evil which is thus shown to be a deviation from
        reason. Virtue however is in the other extreme, that is, in good which
        is characterized as a following of reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        327. By reason of this, virtue and the contrary vices do not follow the
        species indicated by the definition, because right reason is the motive
        and the extrinsic norm for the right appetite. But an evil appetite does
        not intend by vice to deviate from right reason—this is contrary to its
        intention—for it directly intends that object in which excess or defect
        is present. What is contrary to its intention is incidental. Now the
        incidental and the extrinsic do not constitute a species but the species
        of a habit is taken from the object to which the habit tends. But
        according to objects the mean belongs to virtue, and the extremes to
        vices. He says, therefore, that according to the nature of good, virtue
        lies in the extreme but according to the essential species, in the mean.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        328. Then [D’ 3], at “Not every action,” he rejects an erroneous view.
        Because virtue can occupy the middle course and vice the extremes in
        actions and in passions, someone might think that this would happen in
        all actions and passions. But he rejects this by saying that not every
        action or passion of the soul admits a mean in the context of virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        329. He explains this first from reason [3, a], at “Certain ones etc.”
        Certain actions and passions by their very name imply vice: passions
        such as ill-will, shamelessness, envy and actions such as adultery,
        theft, murder. All of these and their like are evil in themselves and
        not only in their excess or defect. Hence in such things a person cannot
        be virtuous no matter how he acts, but he always sins in doing them. In
        explaining this he adds that right or wrong in actions like adultery
        does not arise from the fact that a person does the act as he ought or
        when he ought, so that then the act becomes good, but on the other hand
        evil when not done as it ought. Without qualification sin is present
        whenever any of these is present, for each of them implies an act
        opposed to what is right.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        330. Second [3, b], he gives some examples by way of proof in the matter
        of vice, at “To seek a mean.” He says that because such things imply
        evil in themselves, seeking a mean and extremes in them is like
        attributing a mean to excess and defect, whether it be in acting
        unjustly, or cowardly or lewdly—this would certainly be unfitting. Since
        these actions imply excess and defect, it follows that excess and defect
        would be a mean (which is a contradiction) and that we would have to
        find the excess of the excess and the defect of the defect, which could
        go on forever.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        331. Third [3, c], he explains the same thing by example in the matter
        of virtue at “An excess.” Because temperance and fortitude imply a mean
        of themselves, they do not admit excess and defect in the sense that a
        man can be temperate or courageous in an excessive or defective manner.
        Likewise the mean of those things, which of themselves imply extremes,
        cannot be excess and defect. But no matter how any one of them is done,
        it is vicious.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        332. Last he concludes that there cannot be a mean of any excess or
        defect, nor can there be an excess or defect of any mean.

        We must speak of virtue not only under its universal aspect but we must
        apply the doctrine to individual cases. In discussions which treat of
        actions, universals are not of much utility and particulars are more
        accurate, for actions are concerned with singulars. It is fitting then
        that discussions be in harmony with particulars. Therefore our teaching

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        333. After the Philosopher has explained what virtue is in a general
        way, he now applies the definition in a special way to each virtue. On
        this point he does two things. First [I] he shows the necessity of this
        procedure. Second [II] he carries out his proposal at “In actions
        concerned with fear etc.” He says first that we must speak of the
        essence of virtue not only in its universal aspect but the general
        doctrine must be applied to each case in a special way. The reason he
        gives is that in discussions concerned with actions, universals are not
        of much utility and particulars are more accurate because actions
        pertain to singulars. Fittingly then discussions about actions should be
        in harmony with particulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        334. If then our study be about actions considered only universally, it
        will be futile both because it does not accomplish its purpose, which is
        the direction of individual actions, and because a study from a
        universal viewpoint-where deficiencies in particulars may not
        occur-cannot be made in these things by reason of the changeableness of
        the matter, as was said before (32-36). But the study of particulars is
        more effective, being suitable to control actions, and also more
        accurate because particulars are understood to the extent that the
        universal is verified in them. What was said (289-332), therefore, about
        virtue in general must have been based upon the explanation of
        individual virtues.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        335. Then [II], at “In actions concerned with,” he carries out his
        proposal, showing by particular cases that the mean is good and
        praiseworthy but the extreme is evil and blameworthy. He shows this
        first in the virtues [II, A]; and second [Lect. 9; B], in the passions
        at “Also in the passions etc.” (B. 1108 a 31). Regarding the first point
        we must consider that virtues have been distinguished in two ways. Some
        observe the distinction of virtues according to certain general modes
        which are four in number. The root of virtue consists in the rectitude
        of reason according to which we must direct our actions and passions.
        Actions however are to be directed in a way different from the passions,
        for actions in themselves do not resist reason, as buying, selling, and
        so forth. Consequently, for such things reason need only establish a
        certain equality of rectitude. But the passions indicate a kind of
        inclination that can be contrary to reason in a twofold way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        336. In one way it draws reason to something else, as is evident in all
        passions that deal with following the appetite—for example,
        concupiscence, hope, anger, and others of this kind. For these passions
        reason must establish a rectitude in suppressing and restraining them.
        In another way passion shrinks from what is according to reason, as in
        all passions that denote flight of the appetite—for example, fear,
        hatred, and the like. In passions of this kind reason must establish a
        rectitude by stabilizing the soul in what is conformable to reason.
        According to this we designate four virtues, which some men call
        principal. Rectitude of reason itself pertains to prudence, equality
        established in operations to justice, constancy of soul to fortitude,
        and moderation of the passions—as the words indicate—to temperance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        337. Some, therefore, have understood these virtues in a general way,
        thinking that all knowledge of truth belongs to prudence, the equality
        of all actions to justice, all constancy of soul to fortitude, and all
        curbing and moderation of the passions to temperance. Cicero, Seneca,
        and others spoke of these virtues in this way. They considered such to
        be general virtues and called all other virtues species of these.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        338. But this distinction does not seem to be appropriate. First because
        the above-mentioned virtues are of such a nature that without them there
        can be no virtue. Hence the species of virtue cannot be differentiated
        by this. Second, virtues and vices are not specified by reason but by
        their object (322).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        339. Aristotle then distinguishes virtues more fittingly according to
        their objects or matter. Thus the previously mentioned four virtues are
        not called principal because they are general but because their species
        are taken according to certain important notions, as prudence is not
        concerned with all knowledge of the truth but especially with the act of
        reason that is command. Justice is not concerned with equality of all
        actions but only of those referring to another, where the better thing
        is the establishment of equality. Fortitude is not concerned with every
        kind of constancy but only that which arises at the fear of the danger
        of death. Temperance is not concerned with all restraint but only with
        that of the desires and pleasures of touch. The other virtues, however,
        are as it were secondary. They can be reduced, therefore, to the
        previously mentioned virtues not as species to general but as secondary
        to principal virtues.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        340. Since then these things have been taken for granted, we must know
        that the Philosopher does not treat justice and prudence here but later
        on in the fifth book (885-1108) and the sixth book (1161-1173). He does
        treat here, however, temperance, fortitude, and certain other secondary
        virtues, all of which are concerned with some of the passions. But all
        passions regard some object that pertains either to the bodily life of
        man or external goods or human acts. Therefore, he first [A, A’]
        mentions the virtues touching on the passions, the objects of which
        pertain to bodily life. Second [A, B’] he mentions those pertaining to
        external goods at “In respect to the giving and receiving of money
        etc.”; and third [Lect. 9; C’] those regarding exterior acts at “There
        are three other means etc.” (B. 1108 a 9). On the first point he does
        two things. First [A’, 1] he speaks of fortitude, which regards dangers
        destructive of life. Second [A, 2] he speaks of temperance, which
        regards things useful for the preservation of life, such as food by
        which life is preserved in the individual and sex by which life is
        preserved in the species, at “With regard to pleasures and pains etc.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        341. He says first that fortitude is a mean concerned with fear and
        daring precisely as they regard the danger of death. But of those
        sinning by excess, the state of the man who is excessive in being
        fearless and also deficient in fearing is not given any special name
        because this rarely happens. Likewise many things are without a name
        because men do not advert to them ordinarily so that they would give
        them a name. But he who is extreme in daring is called rash. Such a one
        differs from the fearless man who is so-called from the lack of fear,
        but the rash man is so-called from an excess of daring. He who fears
        excessively and lacks daring is called a coward.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        342. Then [A’, 2], at “With regard to pleasures,” he discusses
        temperance. He says that temperance is a mean not for all pleasures and
        pains but for those of touch, pertaining to food and sex. It is less
        concerned with pains than with pleasures, for pains of this kind are
        caused only from the absence of pleasures. Excess in such things is
        called intemperance, but the defect does not often occur because
        everyone naturally desires pleasure. Hence this defect is unnamed. He
        himself, however, invents a name and calls insensible those who do not
        feel pleasures of this kind. One who, contrary to right reason, avoids
        such pleasures is appropriately called insensible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        343. Then [A, B’], at “In respect to the giving,” he introduces the
        virtues that, regard external things. First [B’, 1] he treats those
        virtues concerned with the desire of external goods and second [Lect. 9;
        B’, 2] those that regard external evils, at “With respect to anger etc.”
        (B. 1108 a 3). External goods are riches and honors. First [1, a] then
        he presents the virtues regulating riches; second [Lect. 9; b] those
        referring to honors at “The mean in regard to honor etc.” (B. 1107 b
        23)Regarding the first he does two things. First [a, i] he treats
        liberality, which is concerned with moderate riches; then [a, ii]
        magnificence, which is concerned with great riches, at “Having to do
        with the use of money etc.” He says first that liberality is a mean
        between the giving and receiving of money. But extravagance and
        stinginess constitute, in an opposite way, excess and defect. The
        spendthrift overdoes the giving and falls short in the acquisition, but
        the miser on the contrary is excessive in acquiring and deficient in
        giving. These matters are here discussed in outline or as conforming to
        a pattern, and as falling under headings or summarily. Later (528-594;
        595-648; 658-706) he will treat more accurately both these and other
        matters.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        344. Then [a, ii], at “Having to do with the use of money,” he
        introduces magnificence. He says that besides the above-mentioned
        habits, liberality and the opposed vices, there are also other virtues
        concerned with money, for which even magnificence is a kind of mean. The
        princely or munificent person, as engaged in expending great sums,
        differs from the generous person who gives small amounts. Excess in
        respect to magnificence is called <i>apyrocalia</i>: a meaning
        “without,” <i>pyros</i> meaning “practice,” <i>kalos</i> meaning “good,”
        that is, without the practice of what is good. Thus those who spend a
        great deal care little about how they bestow their goods. This excess is
        also called <i>banausia</i> from <i>banos</i> meaning “furnace” because,
        like a furnace, the squanderer consumes everything. The defect however
        is called meanness. These extremes in fact differ from those that are
        opposed to liberality, but the way they differ will be treated
        subsequently in the fourth book (707-734).

        As we pointed out, liberality that bestows small amounts differs from
        magnificence. So also there is a virtue concerned with ordinary honors
        that differs from magnanimity whose province is great honors. A man can
        desire ordinary honors in the right way, more than he ought, and less
        than he ought. If he is excessive in the desire of honors, he is called
        ambitious; if deficient, he is said to be unambitious. But he who
        strikes a mean has no special name. Likewise the habits are without
        names except for ambition, which we call the excessive love of honors.
        Hence persons who are in the extremes argue about the location of the
        mean. Even we sometimes call the man possessing the mean ambitious, and
        sometimes we call him unambitious. Why we do this will be explained
        afterwards, but for the present we should refer to the remaining states
        in the way indicated.

        With respect to anger we find an excess, a defect, and a mean. Although

        There are three other means which are alike in one respect and different
        in another. They are all concerned with communicating what we say and
        do, but they differ because one of them refers to the truth, and the
        others to the pleasantness found in this communication. One of these
        latter concerns pleasantness in the things said and done in jest, the
        others regard the things that belong to the usual manner of living. We

        mean is always praiseworthy but that the extremes are neither right nor

        Righteous indignation may be assigned as the mean between envy and
        <i>epicacotharchia</i> or rejoicing in evil. These are concerned with
        pleasure and sorrow over what happens to our neighbors. The righteously
        indignant person is saddened at the unmerited prosperity of the wicked.
        But the envious person goes far beyond this and eats his heart out over
        the success of everyone. The man called <i>epicacotharchos</i> is so
        deficient in sadness that he actually rejoices. However, there will be

        345. Having completed the virtues that concern riches, he now [b] treats
        those dealing with honors. First [b, i] he deals with the virtue
        referring to great honors, and second [b, ii] with the virtue referring
        to ordinary honors, at “As we pointed out etc.” He says first that
        magnanimity is the mean between honor and dishonor. But the excess in
        following after the things belonging to great honors is a certain
        disposition that is called <i>chaumotes</i> because it blazes forth in
        things pertaining to the desire of honor. In Greek <i>cauma</i> is fire,
        and <i>capnos</i> means smoke. If the word be written
        <i>chapnotes</i> it can be translated “exhalation” or presumption. We
        are accustomed to say that they who breathe with great difficulty on
        climbing high altitudes are wheezing or puffing. But the defect opposed
        to magnanimity is faintheartedness.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        346. Then [b, ii ], at “As we pointed out,” he proposes another virtue
        referring to ordinary honors. He says, as has been indicated (344), that
        liberality differs from magnificence because liberality bestows small
        amounts while magnificence bestows great sums. So too there is a virtue
        concerned with ordinary honors which differs from magnanimity which is
        concerned with great honors. That in this question there should be some
        virtue consisting in a mean is made clear by his adding that ordinary
        honors are desired as they ought (this belongs to the mean of virtue),
        more than they ought (this belongs to excess), and less than they ought
        (this belongs to the defect). He who excessively desires honor is
        ambitious or a lover of honor. He who is deficient in the desire of
        honor is unambitious or without the desire of honor. But he who strikes
        a happy mean has no special name.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        347. Likewise the dispositions, i.e., the habits of vice or of the
        mean-virtue are unnamed. However, we can invent names: calling the habit
        by which a person excessively loves honor, ambition; and the habit by
        which a person is deficient in the love of honor, “unambitiousness.” But
        because the mean has not been named, the persons who are in the extremes
        argue about the location of the mean. Both maintain that they possess
        the mean. He explains this by drawing a comparison with two states that
        are in the habit of bickering over their common border when the boundary
        has not been fixed. Both claim the intervening territory as their own.
        But this is fairly common to all the vices for each of the extremes to
        think they possess the mean and that the virtuous are in the other
        extreme, e.g., the coward considers the brave man reckless; the reckless
        man says the brave man is a coward. Hence Aristotle states what is
        proper to this matter, that not only do the vicious appropriate the name
        of virtue to themselves, but even the virtuous use the name of the vice
        as if it were a virtue because the mean has not been named.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        348. This is what he refers to when he adds that even we (speaking
        correctly too) sometimes call a man who possesses the mean ambitious,
        and other times unambitious. Also at times we praise a person because he
        is ambitious. We are accustomed to say in commending a person that he is
        solicitous about his honor, and thus we call the man who loves honor,
        virtuous. On the other hand we sometimes praise an unambitious man,
        saying in his praise that he does not care about the esteem of men, but
        about the truth. So we call the unambitious man virtuous. Why we do this
        will be explained afterwards in the fourth book (794-795)But for the
        present we should continue with the remaining mediums in the way
        designated, that is, as conforming to a pattern.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        349. Then [2], at “With respect to anger,” he proposes the virtue
        concerning external evils by which man is provoked to anger. He says
        that in regard to anger there is an excess, a defect, and a mean.
        Although all these for the most part are without names, we are
        accustomed to call the man following the mean mild, and the mean itself
        mildness. But he who is excessive in this passion we call irascible and
        we say he has the quality of irascibility. The man however who is
        deficient we call apathetic and say he has the defect of apathy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        350. Then [C’], at “There are,” he proposes the virtues that concern
        human actions. First [C’, 1] he shows their variety, and second [C’, 2]
        he gives examples of these at “In regard to truth etc.” He says first
        that three means are alike in one respect and different in another. They
        are alike in that all refer to words and deeds in which men communicate
        among themselves. They are different in that one of them refers to the
        truth of such words and deeds. The others, however, refer to
        pleasantness in these words and deeds, so that one of them regards
        pleasantness in the things that are said or done in jest, the others
        regard what belongs to the usual manner of living, i.e., serious
        matters.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        351. We must speak of these things so it will become more apparent that
        the mean is always praiseworthy and the extremes are not to be praised
        but rather condemned. Many of these are without special names, but, as
        we have done with the others, we shall try to invent names to clarify
        what is said for the sake of the good that will ensue. The reason is
        that the purpose of this science is not the manifestation of truth but
        virtuous activity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        352. Then [C, 2], at “In regard to truth,” he gives examples of these
        virtues and first [2, a] of that which concerns truth. He says that in
        regard to truth the mean is had by the man who is called truthful, and
        the mean itself is called truthfulness. But pretension, which is the
        excess (when a person pretends greater things about himself than are
        true), is called boasting, and the pretender is called a braggart. But
        dissembling, which is the defect (when a person makes pretense of
        certain contemptible things about himself), is called dissimulation or
        irony. Such a pretender is called a dissembler.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        353. Second [2, b], at “In respect to,” he gives an example of the
        virtue concerned with amusement. He says, regarding pleasantness in
        amusement, that the man who observes the mean is called witty
        (<i>eutrapelos</i>) giving as it were a pleasant turn to every incident.
        The disposition itself is called wit (<i>eutrapelia</i>). But the man
        who is guilty of excess is called a buffoon or <i>bomolochus</i>, from
        <i>bomo</i> meaning “altar” and <i>lochos</i> meaning “plundering.” He
        is said to be like the bird of prey which always flew near the
        sacrificial altars to snatch some food. In a similar way the man who is
        excessive in amusement always insists on snatching a word or action of
        someone to give it a comic turn. The disposition however is called
        buffoonery. But the man who is deficient is said to be boorish and to
        have the quality of boorishness.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        354. Third [2, C], at “In the remaining,” he exemplifies the third of
        these virtues saying that in the remaining pleasantness, which is in
        life, touching on our serious actions, the mean is struck by the
        friendly person-not so designated from the effect of friendship but from
        amicable conversation. Such a one we term affable. The mean itself is
        called friendliness or affability. But one who overdoes this merely for
        the purpose of pleasing is called obsequious. If he acts for his own
        utility, for example, his profit, he is called a sycophant or a
        flatterer. One who falls short in this matter and does not fear to
        sadden those he lives with is called contentious and perverse.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        355. Then [B], at “Also in the passions,” he gives an example of certain
        laudable passions-first [B, a], of modesty. He says that a mean is found
        even in the passions and their phases, modesty, for instance, is not a
        virtue, as will be explained in the fourth book (867-882). The modest
        person is praised because a mean can be taken in such matters. One who
        goes to excess so that he blushes at everything is called
        <i>cataplex</i>, a bashful person. But he who falls short, blushing at
        nothing is called shameless, while he who strikes the mean is called
        modest.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        356. Second [B, b], at “Righteous indignation,” he discusses another
        passion called <i>nemesis</i> or righteous indignation, which is a mean
        between envy and <i>epicacotharchia</i> (<i>tharcus</i> meaning
        “rejoicing,” <i>kakos</i> meaning “evil,” <i>epi</i> meaning “over”) or
        rejoicing in evil. These are dispositions concerned with pleasure and
        sorrow over what happens to our neighbors. The righteously indignant
        person or the fair critic is saddened at the prosperity of the wicked.
        But the envious person goes to excess in grieving over all—both good and
        bad—who prosper. The person however called <i>epicotharchos</i> is so
        deficient in sadness that he actually rejoices over the wicked who are
        successful in their wickedness. But these topics are treated elsewhere,
        in the second book of the <i>Rhetoric</i> (Ch. 10).

        357. Last, because justice has. various parts in which the mean is
        differently understood, justice will be treated in the fifth book
        (885-1108) together with the manner in which the parts consist in the
        mean. Likewise, the rational or intellectual virtues will be discussed
        later in the sixth book (1109-1291).

        There are three dispositions, of which two are vices: one by excess, the
        other by defect. The third is virtue and consists in the mean. Everyone

        As the average is greater compared to the less and less compared to the
        greater, so mean habits are in excess compared to the defect and in
        defect compared to excess. This is true both in the passions and in
        actions. The brave man seems reckless compared to the coward, and
        cowardly compared to the reckless. Likewise the moderate man seems
        self-indulgent compared to the insensible man, and insensible compared
        to the self-indulgent. Also the generous person is a spendthrift in

        These things are mutually opposed in such a way that there is a greater
        opposition of the extremes among themselves than to the mean. The reason
        is that the extremes are more removed from one another than from the

        either from the average.

        Moreover there seems to be a similarity between some extremes and the
        mean, for example, between rashness and fortitude, between extravagance
        and generosity. But between the extremes themselves a complete
        dissimilarity exists. Now the things that are farthest removed from one
        another are said to be contraries. Therefore the things most removed

        In some cases it is the defect that is more opposed to the mean but in

        This happens for two reasons, one of which is drawn from the very thing
        itself. It is not the extreme that is nearer and more like the mean but
        its contrary that is more opposed to the mean. Thus, since rashness
        seems nearer and more like fortitude, it is cowardice having less
        likeness that is more opposed to fortitude. Things that are more removed
        from the mean seem to be more opposed to it. This first reason then
        comes from the thing itself.

        But the other reason arises on our part. Those vices which are somewhat
        innate in us seem in a way to be more opposed to the mean. For example,
        we more naturally follow pleasure and so we are more easily moved to
        self-indulgence than to temperance. Therefore, we say that the vices
        that more readily increase are more opposed to virtue. For this reason
        self-indulgence (which is an excess) is more opposed to temperance.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        358. After the Philosopher has shown in general what virtue is, and has
        applied the definition to particular virtues, he treats the opposition f
        virtues and vices. Regarding this question he does three things. First
        [1] he shows that there is a twofold opposition among these habits: one,
        of the vices among themselves, the other, of the vices to the virtue.
        Then [2] he shows that the opposition among the vices themselves is the
        greater, at “These things are mutually opposed etc.” Last [3] he shows
        how one of the extremes is more opposed to virtue than the other, at “In
        some cases etc.” On the first point he does three things. First [1, a]
        he states his proposal. Second [1, b] he proves the proposition, at “As
        the average etc.” Third [1, c] he deduces a corollary from what has been
        said, at “For this reason the extremes tend to throw etc.” He says first
        that there are three dispositions of which two are vices: one by excess
        and the other by defect. The third is according to virtue which consists
        in a mean. Everyone of these is opposed in some way to every other one,
        because not only are the extremes opposed to one another but also the
        mean to the extremes.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        359. Then [1, b], at “As the average” he proves what he had said. It was
        unnecessary to prove that two vices, which are compared to one another
        as excess and defect, are opposed since they are far removed from one
        another. But it will seem doubtful that virtue is opposed to vices, as
        was just said (358). Since virtue holds a middle place between the
        vices, virtue is not very far removed from either of them, while
        opposition is farthest apart, as stated in the tenth book of the
        <i>Metaphysics</i> (Ch. 4, 1055, a 4-32; St. Th. Lect. 5, 2023-2035).
        Therefore, the Philosopher here makes a special point that virtue is
        opposed to both extremes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        360. On this subject we must consider that the mean partakes to some
        extent of both extremes. Precisely as it partakes of one of them it is
        contrary to the other, as the average—a mean between the great and
        small—is small compared to the great and great compared to the small.
        Therefore, the average is opposed both to the great by reason of the
        small and to the small by reason of the great. Because of this there is
        a motion of the contrary against the mean as against a contrary, as is
        explained in the fifth book of the Physics (Ch. 1, 224 b 30-35; St. Th.
        Lect. 1, 476).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        361. Therefore, the habits of the mean both in regard to passions and
        actions appear excessive to one who is in defect and deficient to one
        who is in excess. Thus a brave man compared to a coward is reckless, but
        compared to a reckless man, a brave man is a coward. Likewise a moderate
        man compared to an insensible man is self-indulgent, but compared to the
        self-indulgent the moderate man is insensible. The same may be said of
        the generous man who is a spendthrift in comparison with the miser, but
        a miser in comparison with the spendthrift. It is evident then that
        virtue is opposed to the extremes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        362. Then [1, c], at “For this reason,” he deduces a corollary from what
        was said. Because the mean habit is constituted by comparison of one
        extreme with the nature of the other, the extremes tend to throw the
        mean toward one another. In other words, both extremes consider the mean
        as it were an extreme opposed to them. Thus the coward calls the brave
        man reckless and the reckless man calls him a coward. This is an
        indication of what we just stated (359, 361), that virtue is opposed to
        both extremes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        363. Then [2], at “These things are mutually opposed,” he shows there is
        greater opposition of the vices among themselves than to virtue for two
        reasons. The first reason [2, a] is that the more removed things aile
        from one another, the mom opposed they are because opposition is a kind
        of distance. But the extremes are more removed from one another than
        from the mean, as great and small are more removed from one another than
        from the average, which is a mean between them, Therefore, vices are
        more opposed to one another than to virtue. We must consider that
        Aristotle speaks here about the opposition of virtue to vices, not
        according to good and evil—in this way both vices come under one
        extreme—but according as virtue by reason of its own species is a mean
        between two vices.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        364. He states the second reason [2, b] at “Moreover there seems.” It is
        this. There is some similarity between virtue and one extreme, for
        instance, between fortitude and rashness, between generosity and
        prodigality. But there is complete dissimilarity between the two
        extremes or vices. Therefore, they are opposed to one another in the
        greatest degree because their opposition denotes the greatest distance,
        as was indicated (359).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        365. Then [3], at “In some cases,” he shows that one extreme is more
        opposed to virtue than the other. On this point he does two things.
        First [3, a] he states his proposal. Second [3, b] he assigns the
        reasons at “This happens for two reasons.” He says first that in some
        cases it is the defect that is more opposed to the mean of the virtue,
        but in other cases it is the excess. Thus not rashness, which certainly
        pertains to the excess, but cowardice, which pertains to the defect, is
        most opposed to fortitude. On the contrary, however, it is not
        insensibility (to which lack and defect belong) but self-indulgence (to
        which excess pertains) that is most opposed to temperance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        366. Then [3, b], at “This happens for two reasons,” he assigns two
        reasons for what he said. One [b, i] is taken from the thing itself,
        that is, from the very nature of the virtues and vices. It was just
        stated (364) that one extreme has a similarity to the mean of virtue.
        From the very fact that one extreme is nearer and more like the mean of
        virtue than the other, it follows that not the one more similar to the
        mean but the one contrary to it is more opposed to the virtue. Thus if
        rashness is nearer and more like fortitude, it follows that cowardice is
        more unlike and consequently more opposed to fortitude. The reason is
        that the habits more removed from the mean seem to be more opposed to
        it. But the explanation of these things must be taken from the nature of
        the passions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        367. What Aristotle says here touches on the moral virtues concerned
        with the passions. To these virtues it belongs to preserve the good of
        reason against the movement of the passions. Now passion can destroy the
        good of reason in two ways. First, its vehemence can incite to greater
        activity than reason prescribes, especially in the desire of pleasure
        and in the other passions pertaining to the following of the appetite.
        Hence the virtue, which touches the passions of this kind, aims
        principally at restraining these passions. For this reason the vice
        referring to the defect is more like the virtue, and the vice referring
        to the excess is more opposed to it, as is evident in temperance. But
        other passions destroy the good by withdrawing to something less than
        what is according to reason, as is evident in the case of fear and other
        passions having to do with flight. Hence the virtue concerned with such
        passions strives as much as possible to strengthen man against defect in
        the good of reason. On this account the vice of defect is more opposed
        to the virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        368. Then [b, ii], at “But the other,” he assigns another reason on our
        part. Since virtue ought to restrain vices, the aim of virtue is to curb
        more effectively those vices to which we have a stronger inclination.
        For this reason those vices, which are in any way somewhat innate in us,
        are more opposed to virtue. As from birth we more readily follow
        pleasures than flee from them, we are very early moved to
        self-indulgence which implies an excess of pleasure. Therefore, we say
        that those vices, which rather naturally tend to increase in us because
        we are by nature inclined to them, are more opposed to virtue. For this
        reason self-indulgence, to which excess of pleasure pertains, is more
        opposed to temperance than insensibility is, as has been observed (365).

        A sufficient explanation has been given to show that moral virtue is a
        mean, how it is a mean, that it is a mean between two vices—one by
        excess and the other by defect—and that it aims at the mean both in the
        passions and operations.

        It is not easy to be virtuous because in every case it is difficult to
        discover the mean. Thus, not every one can locate the center of a
        circle—it takes a person who knows. Likewise it is easy for anyone to
        become angry, or to hand out money and waste it. But not everyone (for
        it is not easy) can give to the right person, the right amount, at the
        right time, for the right purpose, in the right manner. All this

        For this reason he who aims at the mean must first avoid the extreme
        which is more opposed to the mean. (Circe used to give this warning:
        keep your ship beyond spray and rolling billow. [ <i>Odyssey</i> xii,
        219]) One of the extremes indeed is a greater sin and the other a lesser

        This is perhaps difficult in individual cases. It is not easy to

        we should be angry, in what type of things we should be angry, and for

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        369. After the Philosopher has treated the nature of virtue, he shows
        here how a person can acquire virtue. He does this because, as was
        indicated before (351), the purpose of this teaching is not that men may
        know the truth but that they may become good. On this point he does two
        things. First [1 ] he shows that it is difficult for man to become
        virtuous. Second [2] he shows how man may attain this, at “For this
        reason he who aims etc.” The first notion calls1or a twofold procedure.
        First [i, a] he reviews what has been said. It has been sufficiently
        explained before (310, 316), he states, that moral virtue is a mean, how
        it is a mean (not objectively but relative to us), and between what
        things it is the mean, i.e., between two vices— one by excess, the other
        by defect. It has also been explained (317-318) why virtue is a middle
        course, namely because it aims at the mean; virtue searches out and
        chooses the mean both in the passions and actions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        370. Second [1, b], at “It is not easy,” he concludes from the premises
        that it is difficult to be good or virtuous because we see that in every
        case it is difficult to discover the mean but easy to deviate from the
        mean. Thus, not everyone—only an informed person who is a
        geometrician—can find the center of a circle. On the other hand, anyone
        can easily deviate from the center. Likewise, anyone can hand out money
        and waste it. But not everyone (for it is not easy) can give to the
        right person, the right amount, at the right time, for the right
        purpose, in the right manner-all of which belongs to virtuous giving.
        Indeed, because of the difficulty it is a rare and difficult thing, but
        praiseworthy and virtuous precisely as conforming to reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        371. Then [2], at “For this reason,” he shows the ways in which a person
        may become virtuous. On this point he does two things. First [2, a] he
        shows how a person can discover the mean. Second (2, b] he treats the
        discovery of the mean at “This is perhaps difficult etc.” In regard to
        the first he gives three admonitions. One of these [a, i]. is taken from
        the nature of the thing. He states that it is difficult to become
        virtuous and to discover the mean. Therefore, one who aims at the mean
        (i.e., he who intends to attain the mean) must strive principally to
        avoid the extreme more opposed to the virtue. Thus if someone wishes to
        arrive at the mean of fortitude he ought to direct his principal efforts
        to avoiding cowardice, which is more opposed to fortitude than rashness
        is, as has been explained (365).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        372. He gives an example of a certain Circe who used to warn sailors to
        beware chiefly of the greatest dangers from the sea, which are waves
        sinking the ship and mist obscuring the vision of the sailors. This was
        the warning: “Clear of the smoke take care and clear of the rollers to
        keep her,” as if to say: so guard your ship that you may escape spray
        and waves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        373. He gives the reason for this admonition, saying that one of the
        extremes—that which is more opposed to the virtue—is a greater sin; but
        that the extreme, which is less opposed to the virtue, is a lesser sin.
        Therefore, since it is exceedingly difficult to reach the mean of
        virtue, a man ought to try to avoid at least the greater dangers that
        are more opposed to virtue. Thus sailors say that after the best voyage
        on which a man is exposed to no dangers, the next best is to choose the
        least of the dangers. A similar thing happens to a man’s life in the way
        that was explained (371), that he may chiefly avoid the vices that are
        opposed to virtue.

        374. He gives the second admonition [a, ii] at “We must take into
        account.” It is understood on our part, as far as concerns the things
        proper to each of us. One who wishes to be virtuous, he says, must take
        into account that to which his appetite is naturally inclined. Different
        people are by nature more inclined to one thing than another. Each one
        can know what he is naturally inclined to from the pleasure and sorrow
        he experiences, because what is agreeable to each according to his
        nature is pleasurable.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        375. Hence, if someone takes pleasure in a particular action or passion,
        this is a sign that he is naturally inclined to it. But men vehemently
        tend to the things to which they are naturally inclined, and so, easily
        exceed the n in this matter. We, therefore, must draw ourselves as, much
        as possible to the opposite. The reason is that when we make an effort
        to recede from sin, to which we are prone, we will finally with
        difficulty arrive at the mean. He makes a comparison with nurserymen who
        straighten crooked saplings. These men wishing to make trees straight
        force them the opposite way and so bring them to the mean, an upright
        position.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        376. Here we must consider that this way of acquiring virtues is most
        effective: that a man should strive for the opposite of that to which he
        is inclined either by nature or habit. However, the way advocated by the
        Stoics is easier: that a man little by little withdraw from those things
        to which he is inclined, as Cicero relates in his work
        <i>Questiones Tusculanae</i> (Bk. IV, C. 31-35, n. 65-76). The way that
        Aristotle lays down is suitable for those who strongly desire to
        withdraw from vice and to attain virtue. But the way of the Stoics is
        more appropriate to those who have weak and halfhearted wills.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        377. He lays down the third admonition [a, iii] at “Everyone.” This is
        also understood on our part, not in the sense that it is proper to every
        individual, as has been said (374-376) of the second admonition, but
        precisely as it is common to all. All are naturally inclined to
        pleasure. Therefore, he says that everyone without exception who aims at
        virtue ought to be on his guard especially against pleasures. Because
        men are very inclined to pleasure, pleasurable objects apprehended
        easily move their appetite. Hence, he notes that we cannot easily judge
        pleasure by dwelling on its consideration without the appetite accepting
        it and bursting forth in desire for it. What the Trojan elders felt
        toward Helen when they decided that she must depart, we ought to feel
        toward pleasure; in all that concerns pleasure we ought to reecho their
        words in order that we may reject bodily pleasures. Rejecting pleasures
        in this way, we will fall into sin less frequently since the desire of
        pleasure leads men to many sins.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        378. He concludes then that those who do what has been suggested under
        this heading, i.e., summarily, will be quite able to acquire the mean of
        virtue.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        379. Then [2, b], at “This is perhaps difficult,” he shows how the mean
        of virtue must be determined. On this point he does three things. First
        [b, i] he indicates the difficulty of this. Next [b, ii] he shows what
        suffices to determine the mean, at “One who deviates a little etc.” Last
        [b, iii] he answers a latent question at “It cannot be determined etc.”
        He says first that it is difficult to discover the mean especially when
        we consider the particular circumstances in individual actions. The
        reason is that it is not easy to determine how a thing is to be done and
        in regard to what persons, and in what type of things, and how long a
        time one should be angry. He gives a sign of this difficulty: that
        those, who are deficient in getting angry for instance, are sometimes
        praised by us and called mild, while those who are rather irascible in
        inflicting punishment or making resistance are sometimes praised by us
        and called manly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        380. Then [b, ii], at “One who.” he indicates what suffices for the mean
        of virtue. He says that one who deviates a little from what is done well
        according to virtue is not censured, whether he inclines to excess or
        defect. The reason is that a slight departure from the mean of virtue is
        hidden on account of the difficulty with the mean. But one who deviates
        greatly is censured because the deviation is not hidden.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        381. Then [b, iii], at “It cannot easily,” he answers a latent question.
        Someone could ask how much departure from the mean should be censured
        and how much should not. He himself answers that it cannot easily be
        determined, in so many words, at what point and how much a person
        departing from the mean should be blamed. Likewise no other sensible
        thing, which is judged rather by sense than reason, can easily be
        determined. Things of this kind, belonging to the operations of the
        virtues, are individual cases. For this reason judgment about them
        exists in the sensitive part of the soul, even if not in the external,
        at least in the internal sense by which a person judges well about
        singulars, and to which belongs the judgment of prudence, as will be
        said in the sixth book (1215, 1249). But this much suffices here to show
        that the mean habit in all cases is rather praiseworthy. However,
        sometimes we must incline toward excess and sometimes toward defect
        either on account of the nature of virtue or on account of our
        inclination, as is clear from what was explained above (369-378). Thus
        the mean according to which a thing is done well will be easily
        discovered. So ends the second book.
