acting.  &#8212; 245-247</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Virtue is of two kinds, intellectual and moral. The intellectual is generated and fostered for the most part
by teaching, and so requires time and experience. Moral virtue however is derived from customary action
(<i>mos</i>). Hence by a slight variation of the original term we have this name &#8220;moral.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -2.18833in; margin-left: 2.18833in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>bb.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>He shows that moral virtue is not in us by nature.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -2.18833in; margin-left: 2.18833in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>a&#8217;<span>&#160;&#160;</span>The first (reason) is this. &#8212; 248-249</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">From this it is clear that moral virtue is not instilled in us by nature, for nothing natural is changed by
habit; thus a stone that naturally gravitates downward will never become accustomed to moving upward,
not even if someone should continue to throw it into th air ten thousand times. Neither will fire become
accustomed to tend downward, nor will anything else that naturally tends one way acquire the contrary
custom. Therefore, the moral virtues are not in us by nature nor are they in us contrary to nature. We do
have a natural aptitude to acquire them, but we are perfected in these virtues by use.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -2.18833in; margin-left: 2.18833in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>b&#8217;<span>&#160;&#160;</span>The second reason. &#8212; 250</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Again in the things that come to us from nature, we first receive the potentialities and afterwards we put
them into operation. This is obvious in the case of the senses, for we did not acquire our senses from
seeing and hearing repeatedly but on the contrary we made use of the senses after we have them&#8212;we did
not come into possession of them after we used them. Virtues however we acquire by previous activity
as happens in different arts, for the things we must learn how to make, we learn by making. Thus men
become builders by building and harpists by playing the harp. Likewise we become just by doing just
actions, we become temperate by doing temperate actions, and we become courageous by doing
courageous actions.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Our contention is verified by what is done in the state, for legislators make men good in accordance with
political norms. Such is the aim of every legislator. In fact he who does not succeed in this fails in
lawmaking. It is precisely in this way that a good constitution differs from a bad one.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Again, every virtue has both its origin and its deterioration from the same principles. A similar situation
is found in any art, for it is from playing the harp that both good and bad harpists are made.
Proportionately this can be said of builders and of all the rest. Men become good builders from building
well, but they become poor builders by building poorly. If this were not so, there would be no need of
a teacher but all would be born good or bad workmen. This is the case also with virtue. Of those who
engage in transactions with their fellowmen, some become just and others unjust. Of those exposed to
dangers who habitually experience fear or confidence, some become brave and some cowardly. We may
say the same of men in reference to concupiscence and anger, for some become tmperate and mild, others
self-indulgent and irascible; some conduct themselves well in these matters, others badly. We may then
universally state in one sentence: like actions produce like habits.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Therefore, we must cultivate actions of the right sort because differences in actions are followed by
differences in habits. It is not of small moment but it matters a great deal&#8212; more than anything
else&#8212;whether one becomes promptly accustomed to good or bad habits from youth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">245. After the Philosopher has treated the questions introductory to virtue, he now begins the study of
the virtues. He divides the treatise into two parts. In the first part [I] he treats the virtues themselves. In
the second he examines certain things that follow or accompany the virtues. He does this in the seventh
book (B. 1145 a 15) at &#8220;Now, making a new start, we must say etc.&#8221; [Lect. 1; I]. The first part is
subdivided into two sections. In the first [I, A] he studies the moral virtues; in the second the intellectual
virtues, in the sixth book (B.1138 b 18) at &#8220;But since we previously said etc.&#8221; [Lect. 1]. The reason for
this order is that the moral virtues are more known, and through them we are prepared for a study of the
intellectual virtues. In the first [A, A&#8217;], which is divided into two parts, he investigates the matter of the
moral virtues in general. In the second [Bk. III, Lect. 14] he examines the moral virtues specifically, at
&#8220;We stated previously... is a mean etc.&#8221; (B.1115 a 7). This first is again subdivided into two parts. In the
first of these [A&#8217;, 1] he treats moral virtue in general. In the second he examines certain principles of
moral actions. This is in the third book [Lect. 1] beginning at &#8220;Since virtue is concerned with passions
etc.&#8221; (B. 1109 b 30). This first has a threefold division. In the first part [1, a] he is looking for the cause
of moral virtue. In the second [Lect. 5] he seeks to find out what moral virtue is, at &#8220;Now we must search
out the definition of virtue&#8221; (B. 1105 b 20). In the third part [Lect. 11] he shows how a man may become
virtuous, at &#8220;A sufficient explanation has been given etc.&#8221; (B. 1109 a 19). On the initial point he does
three things. First [a, i] he shows that moral virtue is caused in us by actions. Second [Lect. 2; a, ii] he
shows by what actions it may be caused in us, at &#8220;The present study etc.&#8221; (B.1103 b 27). In the third part
[Lect. IV] he finds a particular problem in what was previously said, at &#8220;Someone may rightly ask etc.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">(B.1105 a 18). In regard to the first he does two things. Initially [i, x] he shows the cause of the formation
of virtue; and second [I, y] what the cause of its destruction is, at &#8220;Again, every virtue etc.&#8221;On the initial
point he does three things. First [x, aa] he proposes that moral virtue originates in us from the habit of
acting. Second [x, bb] that mora virtue is not in us by nature, at &#8220;From this it is clear etc?&#8217; Third [x, cc]
he explains by a sign what he had said, at &#8220;Our contention is &#8216;verified by what is done etc.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">246 . He says first that virtue is of two kinds, intellectual and moral, and that the intellectual is both
generated and increased for the most part by teaching. The reason is that intellectual virtue is ordered to
knowledge which we acquire more readily from teaching than by discovery. More people can know the
truth by learning form others than by ascertaining it themselves. Everyone indeed who finds out from
others will learn more than he can discover by himself. But because we cannot proceed to in the process
of learning, men must learn many truths by discovery. Besides, since all our knowledge is derived from
the senses, and the senses in turn very often beget experience, it follows that intellectual virtue may need
long experience.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">247. But m moral virtue is derived from customary activity. Now moral virtue, found in the appetitive
part, implies a certain inclination to something desirable. This inclination is nature, which tends to what
is agreeable to itself, or from custom which is transformed into nature. Hence the name &#8220;moral&#8221; differing
somewhat from custom is taken from it. In Greek <i>ethos</i> spelled with <i>epsilon</i>&#8212;a short &#8220;e&#8221;&#8212;means habit
or moral virtue, while <i>ithos</i> spelled with <i>eta</i>&#8212;a long &#8220;e&#8221;&#8212;signifies custom. With us also, the name
&#8220;moral&#8221; means custom sometimes and other times it is used in relation to vice or virtue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">248. Then [x, bb], at &#8220;From this it is clearly,&#8221; he proves from the premises that moral virtue is not
produced by nature for two reasons. The first [bb, a&#8217;] is that none of the things from nature are changed
by use. He illustrates this point by the example of a stone that naturally tending downwards will never
become accustomed to moving upward, no matter how often it is thrown into the air. The reason is that
the things which naturally operate either merely operate or they operate and are operated upon. If they
merely operate, their principle of action is not changed. So long as the cause remains the same, the
inclination to the same effect remains. If, however, they so operate as also to be operated upon&#8212;unless
the passivity be such that it removes the principle of action&#8212;the natural tendency in them will not be
destroyed. But if the passivity be such as to take away the principle of action, then it will not belong to
the same nature. Thus what was previously natural will cease to be natural. When a thing operates
naturally, therefore, no change is effected regarding its action. The same is also true if the operation is
contrary to nature unless perhaps the motion be such that it destroys nature. But if the natural principle
of the operation remains, there will always be the same action. Therefore, in the things that are according
to nature and in the things that are contrary to nature habit plays no part.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">249. The reason for this is that moral virtue pertains to the appetite that operates according as it is moved
by the good apprehended. When the appetite operates often, therefore, it must be often moved by its
object. in this the appetite follows a certain tendency in accordance with the mode of nature, as many
drops of water falling on a rock hollow it out. Thus it is obvious that the moral virtues are not in us by
nature, nor are they in us contrary to nature. We do have a natural aptitude to acquire them inasmuch as
the appetitive potency is naturally adapted to obey reason. But we are perfected in these virtues by use,
for when we act repeatedly according to reason, a modification is impressed in the appetite by the power
of reason. This impression is nothing else but moral virtue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">250. He presents the second reason [bb, b&#8217;] at &#8220;Again in the in the things.&#8221; In all the things with which
nature has endowed us, potency is previous to operation. This is obvious in the senses. We did not
receive the sense of sight and hearing from seeing and hearing repeatedly. On the contrary, from the fact
that we had these senses, we began to use them. It did not happen that we came into possession of the
senses from the fact that we used them. But we have acquired the virtues by acting according to virtue,
as happens in the operative arts in which men learn by making the things that are to be made after they
have mastered the skill. In this way men become builders by building, and harpists by playing the harp.
Likewise men become temperate or courageous by doing just actions or temperate actions or courageous
actions. Therefore, virtues of this kind are not in us by nature.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">251. Then [x, cc], at &#8220;Our contention is verified,&#8221; he makes known what he had said, by a sign. He says
the statement just made that by performing actions we become virtuous is verified by what is done in the
state. Legislators make men virtuous by habituating them to virtuous works by means of statutes, rewards
and punishment. Such ought to be the aim of every legislator&#8212;in fact he who does not succeed in this
fails in lawmaking. It is precisely in this way that a good constitution differs from a bad one.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">252. Then [i, y], at &#8220;Again, every virtue,&#8221; he shows that virtue is produced and destroyed by identical
works. First [y, aa] he explains his proposition, and second [y, bb] he infers a corollary from what has
been said, at &#8220;Therefore, we must etc.&#8221; He says first that the production and the destruction of virtue have
their source in the same principles taken in a different way. The same is true in any art. He shows this
first from activities, because men become both good and bad harpists&#8212;understanding this
proportionately&#8212;from the way they play the harp. A similar reason holds for builders and all other
workmen. Men become good builders by building well repeatedly, they become poor builders by building
poorly. If this were not so, men would not need to learn arts of this kind from some master workman who
would direct their actions, but there would be good and bad workmen in all the arts no matter how they
would be practiced. As it is in the arts, so also in the virtues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">253. Those who act well in their dealings with their fellowmen become just, and those who act in an evil
way become unjust. Likewise those faced with danger who accustom themselves to fear and confidence
in the right way become courageous; in the wrong way, cowardly. This is true also of temperance and
meekness in the matter of concupiscence and anger. We may then universally sum up in one sentence:
like actions produce like habits.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">254. Then [y, bb], at &#8220;Therefore, we must,&#8221; he affirms that a person must give careful attention to the
performance of such actions because differences in actions are followed by differences in habits. He
concludes, therefore, it is not of small moment but it makes a great difference&#8212;indeed everything
depends on it&#8212;that one becomes accustomed to perform either good or evil actions from earliest youth,
for we retain longer the things impressed on us as children.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It must be presupposed that any discussion concerning actions to be performed ought to be given in a
general way and not definitively. We remarked in the beginning that discussions must be pursued
according to the nature of the subject matter. Now things pertaining to actions, and relevant
considerations, do not have anything fixed about them any more than the things that concern health. If
this be true in the general treatment, still mor uncertainty will be found in the consideration of particular
cases. Indeed this study does not fall under either art or tradition. But those who perform moral actions
must always pay attention to what is appropriate to the occasion as is done in medicine and navigation.
Although this is the situation, we ought to try to be of assistance to others in the present study.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">We must then first consider that moral matters are of such a nature as to be destroyed by defect and
excess. To prove such notions that are not readily manifest we must use obvious signs and evidence such
as we have in the case of bodily strength and health. An excessive amount of exercise no less than a lack
of it impairs health. Likewise eating and drinking too much or too little causes damage to health. But
health is produced, increased, and preserved by eating and drinking in moderation. It is the same then
with temperance and fortitude and the other virtues. The man who is afraid of everything, who runs away
and will endure nothing becomes a coward. On the other hand, the man who fears absolutely nothing and
wades into every danger becomes reckless. Likewise a man who tastes every pleasure and passes up
none, becomes intemperate while he who seeks to avoid all pleasures like a boor becomes as it were
insensible. Temperance and fortitude are destroyed by excess and defect but are preserved by the golden
mean.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Not only the production, increase, and destruction of virtues have identical sources and causes but the
actions themselves also have the same sources and causes. We see this in the more obvious actions like
bodily strength. A man becomes strong from taking abundant nourishment and from hard work. Then
when he is strong, he will be more able to do these things. We find the same thing in the virtues since
we become temperate by giving up pleasures, and having become temperate we can b very easily give
up pleasures. The same is true of the virtue of fortitude. We become brave by accustoming ourselves to
despise and endure terrors, and having become brave we are very capable of enduring terrors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">255. After the Philosopher has shown that virtues are caused in us by actions, he now inquires how this
is done [ii]. On this point he does two things. First [ii, x] he shows what are the actions that cause virtue
in us. Second [Lect. 3; y], at &#8220;We may understand etc.&#8221; (B.1104 b 4), he shows what is the sign of virtue
already produced in us. On the initial, point he does three things. First [x, aa] he shows the necessity of
the present investigation. Second [x, bb], at &#8220;It must be presupposed etc.,&#8221; he treats the method of
investigation. Third [x, cc] he shows actions as causes of virtue. In regard to the first he does two things.
Initially [aa, a&#8217;] he presents the necessity itself. Second [aa, b&#8217;], at &#8220;To be in accord with right reason
etc.,&#8221; he shows what we must suppose here. Regarding the first we must consider that in the speculative
sciences where we seek only the knowledge of the truth, it is sufficient to know what is the cause of a
determined effect. But in the practical sciences whose end is action, we must know by what activities or
operations a determined effect follows from a determined cause.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">256. He says then that the present study, moral philosophy, is not pursued for the sake of the
contemplation of truth like the other studies of the speculative sciences, but for the sake of action. In this
science we seek a definition of virtue not only to know its truth but to become good by acquiring virtue.
The reason he assigns is that if the investigation of this science were for the knowledge of truth alone,
it would have little utility. It is not of great importance nor does it contribute much to the perfection of
the intellect that a man should know the changeable truth about contingent actions with which virtue is
concerned. This being the case, he concludes that we must thoroughly inquire about the actions we ought
to perform because, as we have already observed (248-253), actions have influence and control over the
formation of good and bad habits in us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">257. Then [aa, b&#8217;], at &#8220;To be in accord with right,&#8221; he shows it should be taken for granted that actions
causing virtue possess the common quality of being in accord with right reason. This happens because
the good of everything consists in the fact that its operation is suited to its form. Now the distinctive form
of man is that which makes him a rational animal. Hence man&#8217;s action must be good precisely because
it harmonizes with right reason, for perversity of reason is repugnant to its nature. Later in the sixth book
(1109) we shall ascertain what is right reason, which belongs to the intellectual virtues, and how it
pertains to the other virtues, which are the moral.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">258. Then [x, bb], at &#8220;It must be,&#8221; he explains the method of investigating matters of this kind. We must
presume, he says, that any discussion concerned like this with actions to be performed ought to be given
in a general way, that is, as a precedent or as, likely, but not definitively. This was pointed out in the
introduction to the whole work (24). The reason is that the discussions are to be carried on according to
the nature of the subject matter, as was noted in the same place (32). We see that things pertaining to
moral actions and materials useful to them, like external goods, do not have in themselves anything fixed
by way of necessity, but everything is contingent and changeable. The same occurs in works relating to
medicine, which are concerned with health, because the dis position of the body to be cured and the
remedies used to effect a cure are changeable in many ways.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">259. The teaching on matters of morals even in their general aspects is uncertain and variable. But still
more uncertainty is found when we come down to the solution of particular cases. This study does not
fall under either art or tradition because the causes of individual actions are infinitely diversified. Hence
judgment of particular cases is left to the prudence of each one. He who acts prudently must attentively
consider the things to be done at the present time after all the particular circumstances have been taken
into consideration. In this way a doctor must act in bringing about a cure and a captain in steering a ship.
Although this doctrine is such as to be uncertain in its general aspects and incapable of precision in
particular cases, we ought to study it so that in these matters we may be of some assistance to men in
directing their actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">260. Then [x, cc], at &#8220;We must then first,&#8221; he shows what are the operations that may cause virtue. On
this point he does two things. First [cc, a&#8217;] he shows by what actions virtue is caused. Second [cc, b&#8217;],
at &#8220;Not only the production etc.,&#8221; he shows that virtue already formed produces in turn like actions. He
says first we must consider before anything else that virtues or operations causing virtues are of such a
nature as to be destroyed by excess and .defect. To prove this we must use certain more obvious signs
and evidence, that is, the things happening in regard to the powers of the body that are more manifest
than the capacities of the soul.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">261. We see that bodily strength is impaired by immoderate games, that is, certain bodily exercises in
which the contestants do battle naked, because the natural power of the body is weakened by excessive
exertion. Likewise the lack of exercise destroys bodily strength because, when not exercised, the
members remain flabby and incapable of work. A similar comment may be made about health. If
someone takes either too much food or drink, or less than he needs, his health is impaired. But if a man
uses exercise, food, and drink in moderation, he will become physically strong and his health will be
improved and preserved.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">262. It is the same with the virtues of the soul, for instance, fortitude, temperance, and the other virtues.
A person who fears everything, takes to flight, and never faces anything terrifying becomes a coward.
Likewise he who fears nothing and wades into every danger thoughtlessly becomes rash. The same is true
of temperance. He who tastes every pleasure and avoids none becomes intemperate. But he who avoids
all pleasures as a boor does, without any reason, becomes as it were insensible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">263. However we are not to conclude from this that virginity, which abstains from all venereal pleasure,
is a vice. The reason is that virginity does not abstain from all pleasures, and that it abstains from
particular pleasures according to right reason. Similarly, it is not a vice for some soldiers to refrain from
all venereal pleasure in order to devote themselves more fully to fighting. Now these things have been
said because temperance and fortitude are destroyed by excess and defect but are preserved by the golden
mean, which is understood not according to quantity but according to right reason.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">264. Then [cc, b&#8217;] at &#8220;Not only,&#8221; he shows that virtue produces actions similar to the actions that caused
it. He says that the same kinds of activity cause the production and increase of virtue, and also its
destruction if they are taken in a contrary way. Likewise the operations of the virtues already produced
consist in these same works. This is obvious in bodily actions which are more manifest. As bodily
strength is caused from the fact that a man can take abundant nourishment and can work hard, and when
he has become strong he will be more able to do these things, so also it is with the virtues of the soul.
From the fact that we give up pleasures, we become temperate; and when we have become temperate,
we can very easily give up pleasures. It is the same with the virtue of fortitude. We become brave by
accustoming ourselves to despise and endure terrors, and having become brave we are very capable of
enduring terrors. So also, fire once kindled from generated heat can give off intense heat.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">We may understand pleasure or sorrow that follows activity as an indication of the habits that are present.
Indeed the man who avoids bodily pleasures is temperate if he is glad about it; intemperate, if sad about
it. Likewise, the man who encounters dangers is brave if he rejoices or is not sad, but cowardly if he is
saddened. Moral virtue then is concerned with pleasure and sorrows.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">We perform evil actions for the sake of pleasure and avoid good actions because of sadness. Therefore,

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Furthermore, as we said previously, every habit of the soul has a natural disposition to do and to be
busied with those things by which it is made better and worse. Men become wicked by pursuing the
pleasures and avoiding the sorrows that are wrong, or by doing this at the wrong time or in the wrong
manner or in some other way that one may deviate from reason. Consequently, some define virtues as
certain quiescent and emotionless dispositions. But they err in speaking absolutely and in not qualifying
the passions as to manner, time, and so forth. We must suppose therefore that virtue is such that it works
what is best regarding pleasures and sorrows, and vice does the contrary.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Our contention will become evident from the following consideration. Three things fall under our choice:
the good, the useful, the pleasurable; and three contrary things we avoid: the evil, th harmful, the
sorrowful. In regard to all these, the virtuous man disposes himself rightly and the vicious man badly.
This is especially true in the matter of pleasure that is common to animals and is found in all things
obtained by choice, for the good and the useful seem also to be pleasurable.</span></p>

is always treated by art and virtue, which operate well and more efficiently in the face of difficulty.

Assuredly he who uses these well will be virtuous, and he who uses them badly will be evil.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">265. After the Philosopher has shown what kind of activity produces virtue, he now [y] explains how we
may recognize virtue already produced. On this point he does two things. First [y, aa] he presents what
he intends to do; and second [y, bb], at &#8220;We perform evil actions etc.,&#8221; he proves his proposition.
Regarding the first we must consider that when virtue produces actions similar to the actions that formed
it, as was just noted (264), the performance of this action differs before and after virtue. Before virtue
man does a kind of violence to himself in operating this way. Such actions, therefore, have some
admixture of sorrow. But after the habit of virtue has been formed, these actions are done with pleasure.
The explanation is that a habit exists as a sort of nature, and that is pleasurable which agrees with a thing
according to nature.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">266. He ssays that an indication that habits, good or bad, have already been formed is given by the
pleasure or sorrow that follows the operations. He illustrates this by examples. The man who is glad that
he has avoided bodily pleasures is temperate because he performs an action in keeping with the habit.
Likewise, he who encounters dangers with pleasure, or at least without sorrow, is brave. Particularly in
the act of fortitude it is enough not to have sorrow, as will be explained in the third book (584-585). One
who faces dangers with sorrow is cowardly. He then assigns the reason for what he has said from the fact
that every moral virtue is concerned with pleasures and sorrows.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">267. From this we must not conclude that ever moral virtue is concerned with pleasures and sorrows as
its proper matter. The matter indeed of every moral virtue is that on which reason imposes a norm. Thus
justice treats of dealing with others, fortitude treats of fears and aggressiveness, temperance of certain
pleasures. But pleasure is the principal end of all the moral virtues, as will be said in the seventh book
of the present work (1504-1515). In every moral virtue it is requisite that a person have joy and sorrow
in the things he ought. In keeping with this, he says that moral virtue is concerned with pleasures and
sorrows because the purpose of any moral virtue is that a man be rightly ordered in his pleasures and
sorrows.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">268. Then [y, bb], at &#8220;We perform evil actions,&#8221; he proves his proposition: first [bb, a&#8217;] by reasons taken
from things belonging to virtue, and second [bb, b&#8217;], at &#8220;Our contention will etc., by reasons on the part
of the virtuous man himself. He presents four reasons pertaining to the first point. The first reason [a&#8217;,
a] is taken from the inclination of men intent on virtue. It was shown previously (264-265) that virtue is
produced and destroyed by deeds of the same person done in a contrary way. Indeed, we see that virtue
is destroyed by pleasure and sadness; we perform evil actions out of a desire for pleasure, we avoid good
or virtuous works because of the sadness we fear in honest labor. Hence, as Plato said, one who is intent
on virtue should have some sort of moral training from his earliest years that he may rejoice and be
sorrowful about the right things. This is proper instruction for youths so that they become accustomed
to take pleasure in good works and be grieved in evil works. Therefore, teachers of youth compliment
those who do good deeds and reprove those who do evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">269. At &#8220;Besides, if&#8221; [a&#8217;, b] he presents the second reason based on the matter of the moral virtue in the
following way. Evry moral virtue deals with actions (as justice which treats of buying, selling, and other
things of this kind), or with passions (as mildness which treats of anger), and so with the other virtues.
But pleasure or sorrow follows every passion that is nothing else but the motion of the appetitive power
in pursuit of good or in flight from evil. When the good to which the appetite tends is forthcoming,
therefore, or when the evil which it flees is avoided, pleasure follows. But when the contrary happens,
sorrow follows. Thus the angered man rejoices in getting revenge and likewise the cowardly man in
avoiding dangers. But when the opposite is true, these persons are sorrowful. It remains, therefore, that
every moral virtue regards pleasures and sorrows as having the aspect of ends.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">270. The third reason presented at &#8220;Penalties inflicted&#8221; [a&#8217;, c] is taken from the idea of a remedy for the
soul. As a medicine used for the restoration of health is a kind of disagreeable potion from which the
sweetness has been removed, so a penalty used for the restoration of virtue is a kind of medicine, for a
penalty consists in taking away certain pleasures or applying certain disagreeable things. The reason for
this is that a medicine is naturally to be used as a contrary thing. Thus in the case of fever doctors apply
cooling remedies. Hence moral virtue also is concerned with certain pleasures and sorrows.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">271. At &#8220;Furthermore, as [a&#8217;, d] he presents the fourth reason, which. is taken from what is contrary to
and destructive of virtue. Every habit, he says, has a disposition to do and to be busied with the things
by which it is made worse and better, that is, by which the goodness of a good habit and the evil of a bad
habit is increased. This can be understood likewise of the things by which the habit naturally becomes
worse or better, that is, by which it naturally is formed or increased (which is to be made better), or
destroyed or diminished (which is to be made worse). We see that men become evil through the
deterioration of virtue from the fact that they pursue the pleasures and steer clear of the sorrows which
they ought not, or when they ought not, or in some other way by which one may deviate from right
reason.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">272. The Stoics took occasion of this to say that virtues are certain quiescent and passionless
dispositions. The reason was that they saw men become evil through pleasures and sorrows, and
consequently they though that virtue consists in the total cessation of the changes of the passions. But
in this they erred wishing to exclude entirely the passions of the soul from a virtuous man. It belongs, of
course, to the good of reason to regulate the sensitive appetite&#8212;and the passions are movements of this
appetite. Hence it is not the business of virtue to exclude all, but only the inordinate passions, that is,
those which are not as they ought to be and aare not at the time the ought to be (he adds also all the other
things belonging to the remaining circumstances). From this he then concludes that we must suppose that
virtue should work what is best regarding pleasures and sorrows but vice, which is the habit opposed to
virtue should work what is evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">273. Then [bb, b] at &#8220;Our contention will&#8221; he introduces to his proposition four other reasons taken on
the part of men in whom virtue, pleasure, and sorrow are found. The first reason [b&#8217;, a] is derived from
pleasures in general. He says that three things fall under human choice: the good or virtuous, the helpful
or useful, and the pleasurable. Contrary to these are also three things: evil or vice as opposed to the
virtuous, the harmful as opposed to the useful, the sorrowful as opposed to the pleasurable. In regard to
all these, the virtuous man disposes himself rightly but the vicious man badly, especially in the matter
of pleasure, which is more common among the things mentioned since it belongs to two of them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">274. First in regard to the things partaking of pleasure. Pleasure is found in all animals since it is not only
in the intellectual power but also in the sensitive power. The useful and the virtuous, however, pertain
to the intellectual power alone. This is so because the virtuous act is performed in, accord with reason
while the useful implies an order of one to another, and &#8220;to order&#8221; is proper to reason.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">275. Another common feature is on the part of the things themselves in which pleasure is gained.
Pleasure, in fact, follows everything that falls under choice. Now the virtuous is pleasurable to man
because it is agreeable to reason, and the useful also gives pleasure by reason of the expected benefit.
But, on the other hand, not every pleasurable action is useful or virtuous, as is obvious in the pleasures
of sense.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">276. At &#8220;Pleasure, too&#8221; [b&#8217;, b] he presents the second reason, which is taken from an inherent
characteristic of pleasure. Pleasure has grown up with us all alike from childhood, since a newborn child
delights in his milk. Therefore, it is difficult for man to curb this passion acquired with life because it
starts in man at the beginning of life. Hence moral virtue is especially concerned with pleasure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">277. He assigns the third reason at &#8220;Some regulate&#8221; [b&#8217;, c]. This reason is derived from man&#8217;s inclination.
All men regulate their activities by pleasure and sorrow. They are intent on activities they find pleasant
and they avoid activities they find distressing. Hence the whole business of a moral virtue, which is
ordered to good activity, must concern pleasure and sorrow. It is quite important to note what activities
one finds pleasant or painful, whether rightly or wrongly so. The reason is that he who rejoices in good
performs good actions, but he who rejoices in evil performs evil actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">278. He assigns the fourth reason at &#8220;As Heraclitus says&#8221; [b&#8217;, d]. This is taken from a comparison with
anger. It is more difficult, as Heraclitus said, to fight against pleasure than against anger, even though
it seems most difficult to fight against anger because of its vehemence. But the desire of pleasure is both
more common and more natural, and besides, it lasts longer. Art and virtue however always treat of the
more difficult, for anyone can operate well in the easier things. But it takes one skilled in virtue and art
to operate well in difficult things. Thus it is obvious, from what has been said, that the whole business
of virtue and of political science or of public affairs is concerned with pleasures and sorrows. If a man
uses these well he will be virtuous, but if he uses them badly he will be evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">279. Then [y, cc], at &#8220;It has been said that,&#8221; he sums up in conclusion the points that have been made:
virtue is concerned with pleasures and sorrows; virtue is produced and increased by the same actions that,
when done in the opposite way, destroy virtue; the same actions producing virtue are in turn produced
by virtue once formed.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Someone may rightly ask how we can say that man must become just by doing just actions, and temperate
by doing temperate actions. If people perform just and temperate works they are already just and
temperate, as those who produce grammatical or musical works are already grammarians or musicians.<span style="font-weight: bold"> </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">But this is not true in the arts. A man may at times produce something grammatical by chance or with
the help of another. He will therefore be a grammarian only if he produces a grammatical work in a

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Another dissimilarity between the arts and virtues is that works of art have their perfection in themselves.
It is enough then that these be made with certain qualities. Yet works of virtue are not justly and
temperately performed if they have certain qualities, but the agent performing them must fulfill the
following conditions. (1) He must know what he is doing. (2) He must choose th virtuous works for thier
own sakes. (3) He must possess the disposition and operate according to it resolutely and with stability.
Except for knowledge, these conditions are not required in the other arts. Mere knowledge, however ,has
little or no importance to he virtues but what occurs form the frequent performance of just and temperate
actions is all important.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Works then are called just and temperate when they are such as a just and temperate man will do. Now
a just and temperate man is not one who performs these actions but who performs them as the just and
temperate perform them.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It has been well said, therefore, that a man becomes just by doing just actions an temperate by doing
temperate actions. Anyone who does not perform these actions has not the slightest interest in becoming
virtuous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">2. HE DISCREDITS A FALSE OPINION. &#8212; 288</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Many, however, fail to do good actions but, taking refuge in theory, think that by philosophizing they will
become virtuous. They act like the sick who listen carefully to the doctor but do nothing he prescribes.
Hence, just as those who take care of themselves in this way will never have a healthy body, so those who
merely philosophize will not have a healthy soul.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">28o. After the Philosopher has shown that virtues are caused by actions, he now raises a doubt about this
assertion. Regarding it he does three things. First [A] he presents a problem. Second [B], at &#8220;But this is
not true etc.,&#8221; he solves it. Third [C], from the discussion of the question he comes to the conclusion
principally intended, at &#8220;It has been well said, therefore, etc.&#8221; The doubt that he first raises is this. What
is true of virtue is true of art. But in art it is true that no one produces a work of art except one who
possesses the art, as no one produces anything grammatical unless he is a grammarian, nor anything
musical unless he be a musician. It will be true in virtue, therefore, that whoever performs just works is
already just and whoever performs temperate works is already temperate. Hence our previous contention
(164) does not seem to be true, that men become just by doing just actions and temperate by doing
temperate actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">28t. Then [B, 1], at &#8220;But this is not&#8221; he solves this doubt first by rejecting what was assumed about art
and second [B, 2] by disproving the likeness said to exist between virtue and art, at &#8220;Another
dissimilarity etc.&#8221; He says first that it is not true in art, as was assumed, that whoever produces a
grammatical work is already a grammarian. It happens sometimes that an ignoramus by chance
pronounces a word correctly. Sometimes this happens with the help of another whose example is
followed, for instance, a mimic imitates the correct pronunciation given by a grammarian. But a man is
to be judged a grammarian only when he produces a grammatical work and in a grammatical way, that
i&amp;, in accord with the science of grammar that he possesses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">282. Then [B, 2], at &#8220;Another dissimilarity&#8221; he gives the second solution, in two steps. First [2, a] he
eliminates the likeness between art and virtue. Second [2, b] he concludes the solution at &#8220;Works then
are called just etc.&#8221; He says first that there is no similarity in art and virtue since works of art have in
themselves what belongs to the perfection of the art. The explanation is that art is the right plan of
making things, as will be said in the sixth book of the present work (1153, 1160, 1166). &#8220;Making&#8221; is an
operation that passes to external matter, and an operation of this kind is a perfection of the thing made.
Hence in such actions the good consists in the object made. It is enough for the good of art, therefore,
that the things made be good. But virtues are principles of actions that do not go out into external matter
but remain in the agents. Hence actions of this kind are perfections of the agents. So the good of these
actions is identical with the agents themselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">283. He says, therefore, in order that actions be justly and temperately performed, it is not enough that
the things done be good but the agent must work in a proper manner. Regarding this manner, he says we
must pay attention to three things. (i) The first, pertaining to the intellect or reason, is that one who
performs a virtuous action should not act in ignorance or by chance but should know what he is doing.
(2) The second is taken on the part of the appetitive power. Here two things are noted. One is that the
action be not done out of passion, as happens when a person performs a virtuous deed because of fear.
But the action i, should be done by a choice that is not made for the sake of something else, as happens
when a person performs a good action for money or vainglory. The actions should be done for the sake
of the virtuous work itself which, as something agreeable, is inherently pleasing to him who has the habit
of virtue. (3) The third, taken from the nature of a habit, is that a person should possess a virtuous choice
and operate according to it resolutely&#8212;that is, consistently on his part&#8212;and with stability so as not to
be moved by any external thing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">284. Only the first of these, knowledge, is required in the arts. A man can be a good artist even if he
never chooses to work according to art and does not persevere in his work. But knowledge has little or
no importance in a person being virtuous, but his goodness consists entirely in other things that take place
within him by frequent actions, and thus he becomes stable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">285. Then [2, b], at &#8220;Works then,&#8221; he concludes the solution of the abovementioned doubt. He states that
things done are called just and temperate because they are similar to the things that a just and temperate
man does. Whoever performs these actions need not necessarily be just and temperate, but he who
performs them as just and temperate men perform them according to the three conditions just laid down
is said to be just and temperate. Men, therefore, first perform just and temperate actions-not in the same
way as the just and temperate do-and such actions in their turn produce the habit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">286. If it should be asked how this is possible, since nothing can move itself from potency to act, we must
answer that the perfection of moral virtue, which we are treating, consists in reason&#8217;s control of the
appetite. Now, the first principles of reason, no less in moral than in speculative matters, have been given
by nature. Therefore, just as by means of previously known principles a man makes himself actually
understand by personal effort of discovery, so also by acting according to the principles of practical
reason a man makes himself actually virtuous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">287. Then [C], at &#8220;It has been well said, therefore,&#8221; he comes to the conclusion principally intended. First
[C, 1 ] he brings his proposition to an end; and second [C, 2], at &#8220;Many, however, fail etc.,&#8221; he discredits
a false opinion of certain persons. He concludes that it has been well said above (264, 280) that a man
becomes just by doing just actions and temperate by doing temperate actions. But he who does not
perform actions nor develop his disposition will never become virtuous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">288. Then [C, 2], at &#8220;Many, however&#8221; he discredits the false opinion of certain persons who do not
perform works of virtues but, by taking refuge in the discussion of virtues, think they can become
virtuous by philosophizing. Such people, he says, are like the sick who carefully listen to what the doctor
has to say but do nothing about carrying out his prescriptions. Thus philosophy is to the cure of the soul
what medicine is to the cure of the body. Hence, as those who listen to the advice of doctors and
disregard it will never have a well regulated body, so those who listen to the warnings of moral
philosophers and do not heed them will never have a well regulated soul.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">If then virtues are neither passions nor powers, it remains that they are habits. We say, therefore, that

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">289. After the Philosopher has treated the cause of virtue, he now begins to investigate the definition of
virtue. He divides the investigation into two parts. In the first [I] he shows what virtue is, and in the
second [Lect. 10] he ascertains the opposition of virtue to vice at &#8220;There are three etc.&#8221; (B. 1108 b 11).
The first part is treated under two headings. In the first [I, A] he determines what virtue is in general. In
the second [Lect. 8] he applies the adopted definition to particular virtues, at &#8220;We must speak of virtue
not only under its universal aspect&#8221; (B.1107 a 28). This first section is also twofold, and in the first of
these [A, A&#8217;] he investigates the definition of virtue. In the second [Lect. 7; 1] he concludes the
definition, at &#8220;Virtue then is a habit etc.&#8221; (B. 1107). On the first point he first [A&#8217;, 1] investigates the
genus of virtue and second [Lect. 6] its specific difference, at &#8220;We must consider not only etc.&#8221; (B. 1106
a 16). He investigates the genus by parts. Hence, regarding the first he does three things. First [1, a] he
offers the division. Second [1, b], at &#8220;By passions I mean etc.,&#8221; he explains its parts. Third [1, c], at
&#8220;Neither virtues nor vices,&#8221; he argues from the accepted definition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">290. He says first that to establish the definition of virtue we have to take for granted three principles in
&#8216;the soul: passions, powers, and habits. Virtue must come under one of these, for he just said (282) that
virtue is a principle of certain operations of the soul. Now no principle of operation is found in the soul
outside these three. Sometimes a man seems to act from passion, for example, anger; sometimes from
habit, as when he works by art; sometimes from mere potentiality, as when he begins a new activity. It
is obvious that not absolutely everything in the soul is included under this division&#8212;the essence of the
soul and the operation of the intellect do not belong here&#8212;but only the things that are principles of some
operation are considered.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">291. Then [1, b]; at &#8220;By passions I mean,&#8221; he indicates the members of the division just mentioned. First
[b, i] he makes known those that are passions; second [b, ii], those that are powers, at &#8220;I call those
principles powers etc.&#8221;; third [b, iii], those that are habits, at &#8220;I call those principles habits etc.&#8221;
Regarding the first we must consider that passions are not attributed to the vegetative soul because the
powers of this part of the soul are not passive, as they are in both the sensitive part and the intellective
part, but active. The perceptive and appetitive powers, except the active intellect, are passive. Although
feeling and understanding are in a way passions (i.e., they &#8220;suffer&#8221; change , passions are properly
denominated not because of the apprehension of sense or intellect but only because of the appetite. The
reason is that the operation of the perceptive power takes place according as the thing perceived is in the
knower according to the state of the knower. Now the object perceived is, so to speak, drawn to the
knower. But the operation of the appetitive power takes place according as the one desiring is inclined
to the thing desired. Because it is characteristic of the recipient (<i>patientis</i>) that he be drawn by the agent,
and not the converse, it follows that only the operations of the appetitive powers, but not the operations
of the perceptive powers, are called passions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">292. Even among the appetitive powers the operation of the intellective appetite is not properly called
passion. It does not take place with a change of a bodily organ, which is necessary to the nature of a
passion properly speaking. Also in the operation of the intellective appetite, which is the will, man is not
the passive recipient, but rather he directs himself as the master of his action. It remains, therefore, that
operations of the sensitive appetite, which are accompanied by a change of a bodily organ and which in
a way draw man, should be called passions in a strict sense.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">293. The sensitive appetite is divided into two powers: (1) the concupiscible, which concerns sensible
good absolutely (this is pleasurable to sense) and evil contrary to it; (2) the irascible, which concerns
good under the aspect of a certain eminence. For example, victory is said to be a kind of good, although
it is not accompanied by pleasure of sense. Whatever passions concern good or evil absolutely, therefore,
are found in the concupiscible appetite. Certain of these-three in number-regard the good: love (which
implies a certain connaturality of the appetite with the good loved), desire (which implies a movement
of the appetite towards the good loved), and delight (which implies a repose of the appetite in the good
loved). Opposed to these in respect to evil are: hatred to love, aversion or flight to desire, sadness to
delight. But those passions that concern good or evil under the aspect of difficulty belong to the irascible,
as fear and boldness in regard to evil, hope and despair in regard to good. A fifth is anger, which is a
composite passion and so has no opposite.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">294. In enumerating the passions, therefore,. he says they are: concupiscence (which we call desire),
anger, fear, boldness, envy (which is contained under sadness), and joy (which is contained under
pleasure) for this is a non-corporeal pleasure that consists in an interior perception of the good, and
likewise a love, hatred, and desire of the same interior kind. Desire differs from concupiscence in that
concupiscence pertains to bodily pleasure while desire concerns every pleasure without distinction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">295. He adds jealousy and pity, which are species of sadness. Pity is sadness at another&#8217;s misfortune, and
jealousy is sadness because one lacks what others have.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">296. He also adds that pleasure and sorrow universally follow the abovementioned passions, because all
others imply certain movements to good and evil, and these movements are accompanied by pleasure or
sorrow. Hence all other passions are terminated at pleasure and sorrow.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">297. Then [b, ii], at &#8220;I call those principles powers,&#8221; he identifies the powers not in general but those
pertaining to moral study precisely as they differ from the passions. He affirms that powers are said to
exist according as we are considered capable of experiencing these passions, that is, the powers are said
to &#8220;suffer&#8221; or to receive these passions. Thus the irascible power exists according as we are capable of
becoming angry and the concupiscible power according as we are capable of becoming sad or showing
pity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">298. Then [b, iii], at &#8220;I call those principles habits,&#8221; he identifies the habits. Likewise this is not done in
general but in regard to those pertaining to moral study by comparison with the passions. Habits, he
states, are said to exist according as we consistently use the passions well or badly. Now a habit is a
disposition determining a power in reference to something. When the determination is made conformable
to the nature of the thing, there will be a good habit which disposes that a thing be done well, Otherwise
there will be a bad habit according to which a thing will be done badly. He illustrates what we do
according to habit, how we may be angry either wrongly-when this is done in a violent or weak manner,
that is, according to excess or defector well if done with moderation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">299. Then [1, c], at &#8220;Therefore neither virtues,&#8221; he argues from the division previously given, First [c,
i] he shows that virtues are not passions. Second [c, ii], at &#8220;For this reason also etc.,&#8221; he shows that they
are not powers. Third [c, iii], at &#8220;If then virtues etc.,&#8221; he concludes they are habits. For the first statement
he assigns four reasons. The first is this [i, w]. We are called good according to virtues and evil according
to the opposite vices. But we are not called good or evil according to passions taken absolutely. Passions,
therefore, are neither virtues nor vices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">300. He presents the second reason at &#8220;We are neither&#8221; [i, x]. It is taken from praise and reproach, which
are kinds of attestation of goodness and evil. He says that we are praised for virtues and reproached for
the opposite vices. But we are neither praised nor reproached for the passions taken absolutely. A man
is not praised or blamed because he is simply afraid or angry but only because he is afraid or angry in
a particular way, that is, according to reason or contrary to reason. The same must be understood of the
other passions of the soul. The passions of the soul, therefore, are neither virtues nor vices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">301. At &#8220;We become angry&#8221; [i, y] he presents the third reason, which is taken from a virtuous manner
of acting. Virtues are either choices or not without choice, for the very act of virtue can be called virtue.
If we consider the principal acts of virtues, which are interior, virtue is choice; but if we consider the
exterior acts, virtue is not without choice because the exterior acts of virtue proceed from interior choice.
If virtue be taken as the very habit of virtue, even in this sense it does not lack choice, as a cause is not
without its proper effect. The passions, however, come to us without choice because they precede the
deliberations of the reason necessary for choice. This is what he means saying that we are angry and are
afraid without willing it, that is, not by choice of the reason. The passions, therefore, are not virtues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">302. He presents the fourth reason at &#8220;We are said&#8221; [i, z]. This is taken from the very nature of virtue.
The passions are movements according to which we are said to be moved. The virtues and vices are
qualities according to which we are said not to be moved but to be disposed in some way, whether well
or badly that our movement may ensue. The passions, therefore, are neither virtues nor vices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">303. Then [c, ii], at &#8220;For this reason,&#8221; he shows that virtues are not powers for two reasons. The first of
these [ii, x] is taken from the nature of good and evil, as has just been proved (299-300) about the
passions. The reason is this. No one is called good or evil, no one is praised or reproached, because he
is capable of being affected by some passion-for instance, that he is capable of becoming angry or being
afraid. But we are called good or evil and are praised or reproached because of virtues and vices. Virtues
and vices, therefore, are not powers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">304. He gives the second reason at &#8220;Furthermore, the powers&#8221; [ii, y]. It is taken on the part of the cause
and is this. Powers are in us by nature because they are natural characteristics of the soul. But virtues and
vices by which we are called good or evil are not in us by nature, as was proved above (248-251). Virtues
and vices, therefore, are not powers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">305. Then [c, iii], at &#8220;If then,&#8221; he concludes his proposition. If virtues are neither passions nor, powers,
it remains that they are habits according to the previously given division. Thus he concludes that virtue
with regard to its generic definition obviously is a habit.</span></p>

makes the horse good and also makes him good for running, riding and awaiting the enemy. If this be true

preserves it. As we have said, good workmen work with an eye on the mean. But virtue like nature is

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">I am speaking of moral virtue, for it treats of passions and operations in which we find excess, defect,
and the mean. Thus aggressiveness, fear, concupiscence, aversion, anger, pity, and, in general, pleasure
and sorrow take place with excess and defect. Both of these are evil; but to experience these passions at
the right time, for the right objects, toward the right persons, with the right motive, and in the right way
is the mean and the highest good of virtue. Similarly, excess, defect, and the mean are to be found in
actions. Now moral virtue is concerned with passions and operations in which excess is vicious, defect
is reproachable, and the mean receives praise and shows the right path. These two (praise and
righteousness) pertain to virtue. Moral virtue, therefore, is a kind of middle course and aims at the mean. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">306. After the Philosopher has explained, the genus of virtue, he now begins an inquiry into the specific
difference of virtue. First [I] he presents his proposition. He says that in order to know what virtue is we
must consider not only that it is a habit&#8212;thus the genus is understood, but what kind of habit&#8212;thus the
specific difference is indicated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">307. Second [II], at &#8220;We must explain, therefore,&#8221; he makes known the proposition. On this point he does
two things. First [II, A] he manifests a certain common quality of virtue. Second [II, B], from this quality
of virtue he explains its specific difference, at &#8220;How this etc.&#8221; He says first that every virtue makes its
possessor good and his work good. Thus the virtue or power of the eye makes the eye good and gives us
good sight, which is the proper function of the eye. Likewise the virtue or excellence of a horse makes
a horse good and makes it perform well, that is, run fast, ride easily, and fearlessly await the enemy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">308. The reason is that the virtue or power of a thing is judged by the best it can do. For example, the
power of one who can carry a hundred pounds is determined by his actual carrying of this weight, as is
said in the first book <i>De Coelo</i> (Ch. II, 281 a 8; St. Th. Lect. 25, 249) and not by the fact that he carries
fifty pounds. Now the utmost or best to which the power of anything extends is called its excellent
performance. It belongs to the virtue of every thing, therefore, to render an excellent performance.
Because a perfect operation proceeds only from a perfect agent, it follows that everything is both good
and operates well according to its own virtue. If this be true in all other things&#8212;and such was already
apparent from our examples&#8212;human virtue must be a kind of habit, as was mentioned above (305). From
this habit man becomes good formally speaking (as one becomes white by whiteness) and operates well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">309. Then [II, B], at &#8220;How this,&#8221; he investigates the specific difference of virtue according to the quality
of virtue previously indicated. He does this under three headings: first [B, A&#8217;] according to the property
of the operations; second [B, B&#8217;], according to the nature of virtue, At &#8220;but it will become still clearer
etc.&#8221;; third [Lect. 7; C&#8217;] according to the special character of good or evil, at &#8220;Moreover, there are many
etc.&#8221; (B.1106 b 29). He says first that the way in which a man may become good and do good has been
treated already (257). It was noted also (260-264) that we are made good in every virtue by operations
according to the mean. Then having become good we perform good actions. It remains, therefore, that
if virtue makes a man good and his work good, it will consist in the mean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">310. Then [B, B&#8217;], at &#8220;but it will become etc.,&#8221; he proves the same by the nature of virtue. Regarding this
he does three things. First [B&#8217;, 1] he introduces certain preliminaries necessary to explain his proposition.
Second [B&#8217;, 2], he concludes his proposition at &#8220;Every practical science then etc.&#8221; Third [B&#8217;, 3], he
explains an inference at &#8220;I am speaking of moral virtue etc.&#8221; On the first point he does two things. First
[1, a] he proposes the things necessary to elucidate the proposition. Second [1, b] he clarifies what he has
said, at &#8220;By the mean on the part etc.&#8221; He says first that the manner in which we become good and
perform good acts will be clearer still if we consider the nature of virtue. For an understanding of this,
we must take for granted beforehand that virtue treats three things: the more, the less, and the equal.
Virtue treats these both in continuous, contingent matters, and even in any other divisible matter, whether
it be numerically divided as all discrete things, or whether it be divided incidentally&#8212;for example, by
intensity and indistinctness of a quality in a subject. These three are so arranged that the equal holds a
middle place between the more, which pertains to excess, and the less, which pertains to defect. This can
be understood in two ways: one according to absolute quantity in some thing and the other in relation to
us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">311. Then [1, b], at &#8220;By the mean on the part of the thing,&#8221; he clarifies what he said about the difference
on the part of the thing (objective) and in regard to us (relative): first [b, i] by means of reason, and
second [b, ii] by way of example at &#8220;For example, if etc.&#8221; He says first that the objective mean is the
point equidistant from both extremes. It is the same for all because it is understood according to the
absolute quantity of the thing. But the mean is relative in regard to us inasmuch as it neither exceeds nor
falls short of a proportion suitable to us. Hence this mean is not the same for all. If we apply the relative
mean to a shoe, it will not be more than the length of the foot nor less. It will not be the same for all
because not all have the same size foot.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">312. Then [b, ii], at &#8220;For example, if,&#8221; he clarifies what he has said, by way of example: first [ii, x]
regarding the objective mean which is equally distant from the extremes. Thus six is the mean between
ten (which is the more) and two (which is the less) because six is less than ten and more than two by the
same amount, four. The mean, which is taken in numbers from the equal distance between two extremes,
is said to be according to arithmetic proportion which considers numerical quantity. But the mean, which
is taken from the equality of proportion in regard to us, is said to be according to the geometric
proportion as will be made clear afterwards in the fifth book (944, 949, 950, 972).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">313. Second [ii, y], at &#8220;But the mean in regard to us,&#8221; he gives examples of the mean. He says that the
mean, which is understood in comparison with us, is not to be taken according to equal distance between
extremes. This is sufficiently clear in the previous example of the shoe. If a shoe twenty fingers&#8217; breadth
is long and a shoe four fingers&#8217; breadth is short it does not necessarily follow that one twelve fingers&#8217;
breadth will be the right fit. Perhaps it will be large compared to the foot of one person and small
compared to the foot of another. He also exemplifies this mean in food. If eating ten pounds or ten
portions is much and eating two pounds is little, a trainer&#8212;whose duty it is to make out someone&#8217;s
diet&#8212;should not for this reason prescribe six pounds, since even this is much for one person and little
for another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">314. This would indeed be little for a man called Milo who, according to Solinus, ate a whole beef in a
day. But it would be much for a champion in gymnastics, for one who has to excel in sports&#8212;in which
men used to contend naked&#8212;and must eat lightly to be in better condition. The same is true of those who
run at the stadium and of those who take up wrestling&#8212;a sport engaged in by the Greeks for exercise.
So it is also in every operative science. The wise man avoids excess and defect, and wants to find the
mean not objectively but relative to us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">315. Then [B&#8217;, 2], at &#8220;Every practical science,&#8221; he argues from the premises in this way. Every operative
science perfects its work in this: that in planning it aims for the mean, and in execution it carries out its
work in accord with the mean. Indications of this can be had from the fact that men are in the habit of
saying, when a work is well done, that not a thing is to be added nor taken away. Thus they give us to
understand that excess and defect spoil a work which is preserved by the mean. Hence good workmen,
as has been pointed out (313-314), work with an eye on the mean. But virtue like nature is more certain
and even better than any art. Moral virtue operates by inclining in a determined way to one thing as
nature does. Indeed custom becomes nature. But art, which operates according to reason, is indifferent
to various objects. Hence like nature it is more certain than art.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">316. Likewise virtue is better than art because by art a man is capable of doing a good work, but art does
not cause him to do the good work. He can do a bad work because art does not incline to the good use
of art; a grammarian for example can speak incorrectly. But by virtue a man not only is capable of
operating but actually performs the action because virtue like nature inclines to a good operation. Art
alone gives only the knowledge of the operation. Consequently even for this secondary reason virtue,
which is better than art, aims at the mean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">317. Then [ B&#8217;, 3] , at &#8220;I am speaking,&#8221; he explains a further conclusion. He affirms that what has been
said (256-263) ought to be understood of moral virtue that concerns passions and operations to which
belong excess, defect and mean. He gives an example first from the passions saying that fear,
aggressiveness, concupiscence, aversion (which is a fleeing from something), anger, pity, and any
Pleasure and sorrow may happen in greater and less degree than they ought. Both the excess and the
defect are evil. But if a man should fear and dare (so of the other passions) what he ought, in the things
he ought, in regard to the persons he ought, for the motive he ought, and in the way he ought, this will
be a mean for the passions. It will be also the highest good of virtue. Similarly excess, defect, and mean
are found in actions. Moral virtue treats of passions and actions as its proper matter so that in them excess
is vicious and defect worthy of reproach, but the mean receives praise and shows the right path. These
two pertain to virtue: righteousness (which is opposed to vicious perverseness) and praise (which is
opposed to reproach). This and vicious perverseness follow from the first two (excess and defect).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">318. Thus he concludes that moral virtue considered in itself is a kind of middle course and is an
indicator of the mean inasmuch as it aims at the mean and accomplishes it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">To seek a mean in these matters would be like assigning a mean to excess and defect in unjust, or in
cowardly or lustful actions. Thus there would be a mean of an excess and of a defect, and an excess of
an excess and a defect of a defect.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">An excess and defect are not found in temperance and fortitude because a mean is in no way an extreme,
so excess or defect cannot be the mean of vice but what is done is vicious. As a consequence there cannot
be a mean in any excess or defect, nor can there be excess or defect in any mean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">319. After giving the two previous reasons, the Philosopher now [C&#8217;] adds a third based upon the nature
of good and evil. Accepting the Pythagorean view, he says that there are many ways of sinning because
evil, which is included in the nature of sin, partakes of the unlimited, but good partakes of the limited.
We must understand then, on the contrary, that there is only one way of doing what is right.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">320. The reason for this can be found in the statement of Dionysius in the book <i>De Divinis Nominibus</i>,
that good results from a united and complete cause but evil from any single defect, as is evident in
physical goodness and badness. Ugliness, which is a defect of physical beauty, results from any member
being unsightly. But beauty arises only when all the members are well proportioned and of a healthy hue.
Likewise sickness, a defect in the constitution of the body, happens from a single disorder of any humor.
But health is dependent on the proper proportion of all the humors. Likewise sin is committed in human
action from any circumstance being inordinate in any way either by excess or defect. But goodness will
be present only when all the circumstances are rightly ordered. As health or beauty comes about in a
single way but sickness and ugliness in many, even in an unlimited number of ways, so also moral
goodness results in only one way but the act of sin takes place in countless ways. Hence it is easy to sin
because sin can happen in a variety of modes, but it is difficult to do what is right because rectitude
happens only in one way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">321. He gives as an example that it is easy to miss the center of the target, because a miss can happen in
numerous ways. But to hit the center spot is difficult because a hit happens in only one way. Now it is
obvious that excess and defect take place in various ways but the mean in a single way. Hence excess and
defect manifestly pertain to vice but the mean to virtue because men are good simply, that is, in one way,
but evil at sundry times, i.e., in many ways as has just been stated (320).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">322. Then [D&#8217;], at &#8220;Virtue then is,&#8221; he infers the definition of virtue from the premises. First [D&#8217;, 1] he
presents the definition, and second [D&#8217;, 2] he explains it, at &#8220;Virtue is a mean between two etc.&#8221; Third
[D&#8217;, 3] he rejects an error, at &#8220;Not every action etc.&#8221; In the definition of virtue he treats four points. The
first of these is the genus, which he touches on when he says that virtue is a habit (305). The second is
the act of the moral virtue, for the habit must be defined by the act. This he mentions by the word
&#8220;chooses,&#8221; that is, acts according to choice, for the principal act of virtue is choice&#8212;he will discuss this
later (432). Since the act must be determined by the object he refers then, third, to the object or the term
of the action when he says &#8220;the mean in regard to us.&#8221; It was shown above (314) that virtue seeks out and
uses the mean not of the thing but in regard to us. Similarly it has been said (257) that moral virtue is in
the appetite, which participates in reason. He had to add, therefore, a fourth notion, which refers to the
cause of goodness in virtue, by the words determined by reason.&#8221; It is good to seek the mean only insofar
as, it is determined by reason, but because reason can be right or erring, we must perform virtue
according to right reason, as was ascertained previously (257).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">323. To explain this he adds &#8220;as understood by a wise man.&#8221; &#8220;Wise&#8221; here does not refer to one who is
wise simply, knowing the ultimate causes of the whole universe, but rather to one who is prudent, that
is, wise in human affairs, but this he will discuss in the sixth book (1163). Certainly the making of what
is good in the art of building is determined by the judgment of one wise in that art, and the same is true
in all the other arts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">324. Then [D&#8217;, 2], at &#8220;Virtue is a mean,&#8221; he explains the previously given definition in regard to his
saying that virtue consists in the mean. On this point he does three things. First [2, a] he shows between
what things there is a mean and, second [2, b], in reference to what thing- this mean may be considered,
at &#8220;In regard to this etc.&#8221; Third [2, c] he deduces a corollary at &#8220;For this reason virtue etc.&#8221; He says first
that virtue itself is a kind of middle course between two vices and between two vicious habits: one by
way of excess and the other by way of defect . Thus liberality is the middle course between extravagance
tending toward excess and miserliness tending toward avarice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">325. Then [2, b], at &#8220;In regard to this,&#8221; he shows in reference to what norm we are to judge excess,
defect, and mean. He says we must further consider that some vices fall short of but others exceed, both
in the passions and in actions, what is right. In regard to this some are deficient and others are in excess.
But virtue, precisely as it observes what it ought, is said to discover the mean by reason and to choose
it by the will. Thus it is evident that virtue itself is a middle course and, on the other hand, it employs the
mean. It is indeed the middle course between two habits, but it uses the mean in actions and passions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">326. Then [2, c], at &#8220;For this reason,&#8221; he draws a further conclusion from his remarks: that virtue in its
essence and definition is a mean. But precisely as it possesses the character of the best and as it acts or
guides well in a determined genus it is an extreme. For an understanding of this, we must consider (as
has been pointed out in 322), that the entire goodness of moral virtue depends on the rectitude of the
reason. Hence good is in harmony with moral virtue according as it follows right reason, but evil has a
reference to each vice, viz.: excess and defect inasmuch as both depart from right reason. Therefore,
according to the nature of goodness and evil both vices are in one extreme that is, in evil which is thus
shown to be a deviation from reason. Virtue however is in the other extreme, that is, in good which is
characterized as a following of reason.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">327. By reason of this, virtue and the contrary vices do not follow the species indicated by the definition,
because right reason is the motive and the extrinsic norm for the right appetite. But an evil appetite does
not intend by vice to deviate from right reason&#8212;this is contrary to its intention&#8212;for it directly intends
that object in which excess or defect is present. What is contrary to its intention is incidental. Now the
incidental and the extrinsic do not constitute a species but the species of a habit is taken from the object
to which the habit tends. But according to objects the mean belongs to virtue, and the extremes to vices.
He says, therefore, that according to the nature of good, virtue lies in the extreme but according to the
essential species, in the mean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">328. Then [D&#8217; 3], at &#8220;Not every action,&#8221; he rejects an erroneous view. Because virtue can occupy the
middle course and vice the extremes in actions and in passions, someone might think that this would
happen in all actions and passions. But he rejects this by saying that not every action or passion of the
soul admits a mean in the context of virtue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">329. He explains this first from reason [3, a], at &#8220;Certain ones etc.&#8221; Certain actions and passions by their
very name imply vice: passions such as ill-will, shamelessness, envy and actions such as adultery, theft,
murder. All of these and their like are evil in themselves and not only in their excess or defect. Hence
in such things a person cannot be virtuous no matter how he acts, but he always sins in doing them. In
explaining this he adds that right or wrong in actions like adultery does not arise from the fact that a
person does the act as he ought or when he ought, so that then the act becomes good, but on the other
hand evil when not done as it ought. Without qualification sin is present whenever any of these is present,
for each of them implies an act opposed to what is right.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">330. Second [3, b], he gives some examples by way of proof in the matter of vice, at &#8220;To seek a mean.&#8221;
He says that because such things imply evil in themselves, seeking a mean and extremes in them is like
attributing a mean to excess and defect, whether it be in acting unjustly, or cowardly or lewdly&#8212;this
would certainly be unfitting. Since these actions imply excess and defect, it follows that excess and
defect would be a mean (which is a contradiction) and that we would have to find the excess of the
excess and the defect of the defect, which could go on forever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">331. Third [3, c], he explains the same thing by example in the matter of virtue at &#8220;An excess.&#8221; Because
temperance and fortitude imply a mean of themselves, they do not admit excess and defect in the sense
that a man can be temperate or courageous in an excessive or defective manner. Likewise the mean of
those things, which of themselves imply extremes, cannot be excess and defect. But no matter how any
one of them is done, it is vicious.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">332. Last he concludes that there cannot be a mean of any excess or defect, nor can there be an excess
or defect of any mean.</span></p>

acquiring and deficient in giving. For the present we are content to discuss these matters in outline and

meanness. These extremes differ from the extremes opposed to liberality, the manner however of the
difference will be treated later.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">333. After the Philosopher has explained what virtue is in a general way, he now applies the definition
in a special way to each virtue. On this point he does two things. First [I] he shows the necessity of this
procedure. Second [II] he carries out his proposal at &#8220;In actions concerned with fear etc.&#8221; He says first
that we must speak of the essence of virtue not only in its universal aspect but the general doctrine must
be applied to each case in a special way. The reason he gives is that in discussions concerned with
actions, universals are not of much utility and particulars are more accurate because actions pertain to
singulars. Fittingly then discussions about actions should be in harmony with particulars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">334. If then our study be about actions considered only universally, it will be futile both because it does
not accomplish its purpose, which is the direction of individual actions, and because a study from a
universal viewpoint-where deficiencies in particulars may not occur-cannot be made in these things by
reason of the changeableness of the matter, as was said before (32-36). But the study of particulars is
more effective, being suitable to control actions, and also more accurate because particulars are
understood to the extent that the universal is verified in them. What was said (289-332), therefore, about
virtue in general must have been based upon the explanation of individual virtues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">335. Then [II], at &#8220;In actions concerned with,&#8221; he carries out his proposal, showing by particular cases
that the mean is good and praiseworthy but the extreme is evil and blameworthy. He shows this first in
the virtues [II, A]; and second [Lect. 9; B], in the passions at &#8220;Also in the passions etc.&#8221; (B. 1108 a 31).
Regarding the first point we must consider that virtues have been distinguished in two ways. Some
observe the distinction of virtues according to certain general modes which are four in number. The root
of virtue consists in the rectitude of reason according to which we must direct our actions and passions.
Actions however are to be directed in a way different from the passions, for actions in themselves do not
resist reason, as buying, selling, and so forth. Consequently, for such things reason need only establish
a certain equality of rectitude. But the passions indicate a kind of inclination that can be contrary to
reason in a twofold way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">336. In one way it draws reason to something else, as is evident in all passions that deal with following
the appetite&#8212;for example, concupiscence, hope, anger, and others of this kind. For these passions reason
must establish a rectitude in suppressing and restraining them. In another way passion shrinks from what
is according to reason, as in all passions that denote flight of the appetite&#8212;for example, fear, hatred, and
the like. In passions of this kind reason must establish a rectitude by stabilizing the soul in what is
conformable to reason. According to this we designate four virtues, which some men call principal.
Rectitude of reason itself pertains to prudence, equality established in operations to justice, constancy
of soul to fortitude, and moderation of the passions&#8212;as the words indicate&#8212;to temperance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">337. Some, therefore, have understood these virtues in a general way, thinking that all knowledge of truth
belongs to prudence, the equality of all actions to justice, all constancy of soul to fortitude, and all
curbing and moderation of the passions to temperance. Cicero, Seneca, and others spoke of these virtues
in this way. They considered such to be general virtues and called all other virtues species of these.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">338. But this distinction does not seem to be appropriate. First because the above-mentioned virtues are
of such a nature that without them there can be no virtue. Hence the species of virtue cannot be
differentiated by this. Second, virtues and vices are not specified by reason but by their object (322).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">339. Aristotle then distinguishes virtues more fittingly according to their objects or matter. Thus the
previously mentioned four virtues are not called principal because they are general but because their
species are taken according to certain important notions, as prudence is not concerned with all knowledge
of the truth but especially with the act of reason that is command. Justice is not concerned with equality
of all actions but only of those referring to another, where the better thing is the establishment of
equality. Fortitude is not concerned with every kind of constancy but only that which arises at the fear
of the danger of death. Temperance is not concerned with all restraint but only with that of the desires
and pleasures of touch. The other virtues, however, are as it were secondary. They can be reduced,
therefore, to the previously mentioned virtues not as species to general but as secondary to principal
virtues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">340. Since then these things have been taken for granted, we must know that the Philosopher does not
treat justice and prudence here but later on in the fifth book (885-1108) and the sixth book (1161-1173).
He does treat here, however, temperance, fortitude, and certain other secondary virtues, all of which are
concerned with some of the passions. But all passions regard some object that pertains either to the
bodily life of man or external goods or human acts. Therefore, he first [A, A&#8217;] mentions the virtues
touching on the passions, the objects of which pertain to bodily life. Second [A, B&#8217;] he mentions those
pertaining to external goods at &#8220;In respect to the giving and receiving of money etc.&#8221;; and third [Lect.
9; C&#8217;] those regarding exterior acts at &#8220;There are three other means etc.&#8221; (B. 1108 a 9). On the first point
he does two things. First [A&#8217;, 1] he speaks of fortitude, which regards dangers destructive of life. Second
[A, 2] he speaks of temperance, which regards things useful for the preservation of life, such as food by
which life is preserved in the individual and sex by which life is preserved in the species, at &#8220;With regard
to pleasures and pains etc.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">341. He says first that fortitude is a mean concerned with fear and daring precisely as they regard the
danger of death. But of those sinning by excess, the state of the man who is excessive in being fearless
and also deficient in fearing is not given any special name because this rarely happens. Likewise many
things are without a name because men do not advert to them ordinarily so that they would give them a
name. But he who is extreme in daring is called rash. Such a one differs from the fearless man who is so-called from the lack of fear, but the rash man is so-called from an excess of daring. He who fears
excessively and lacks daring is called a coward.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">342. Then [A&#8217;, 2], at &#8220;With regard to pleasures,&#8221; he discusses temperance. He says that temperance is
a mean not for all pleasures and pains but for those of touch, pertaining to food and sex. It is less
concerned with pains than with pleasures, for pains of this kind are caused only from the absence of
pleasures. Excess in such things is called intemperance, but the defect does not often occur because
everyone naturally desires pleasure. Hence this defect is unnamed. He himself, however, invents a name

avoids such pleasures is appropriately called insensible.</span></p>

[B&#8217;, 1] he treats those virtues concerned with the desire of external goods and second [Lect. 9; B&#8217;, 2]
those that regard external evils, at &#8220;With respect to anger etc.&#8221; (B. 1108 a 3). External goods are riches
and honors. First [1, a] then he presents the virtues regulating riches; second [Lect. 9; b] those referring
to honors at &#8220;The mean in regard to honor etc.&#8221; (B. 1107 b 23)Regarding the first he does two things.
First [a, i] he treats liberality, which is concerned with moderate riches; then [a, ii] magnificence, which
is concerned with great riches, at &#8220;Having to do with the use of money etc.&#8221; He says first that liberality
is a mean between the giving and receiving of money. But extravagance and stinginess constitute, in an
opposite way, excess and defect. The spendthrift overdoes the giving and falls short in the acquisition,
but the miser on the contrary is excessive in acquiring and deficient in giving. These matters are here
discussed in outline or as conforming to a pattern, and as falling under headings or summarily. Later
(528-594; 595-648; 658-706) he will treat more accurately both these and other matters. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">344. Then [a, ii], at &#8220;Having to do with the use of money,&#8221; he introduces magnificence. He says that
besides the above-mentioned habits, liberality and the opposed vices, there are also other virtues
concerned with money, for which even magnificence is a kind of mean. The princely or munificent
person, as engaged in expending great sums, differs from the generous person who gives small amounts.
Excess in respect to magnificence is called <i>apyrocalia</i>: a meaning &#8220;without,&#8221; <i>pyros</i> meaning &#8220;practice,&#8221;
<i>kalos</i> meaning &#8220;good,&#8221; that is, without the practice of what is good. Thus those who spend a great deal
care little about how they bestow their goods. This excess is also called <i>banausia</i> from <i>banos</i> meaning
&#8220;furnace&#8221; because, like a furnace, the squanderer consumes everything. The defect however is called
meanness. These extremes in fact differ from those that are opposed to liberality, but the way they differ
will be treated subsequently in the fourth book (707-734).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">As we pointed out, liberality that bestows small amounts differs from magnificence. So also there is a
virtue concerned with ordinary honors that differs from magnanimity whose province is great honors.
A man can desire ordinary honors in the right way, more than he ought, and less than he ought. If he is
excessive in the desire of honors, he is called ambitious; if deficient, he is said to be unambitious. But
he who strikes a mean has no special name. Likewise the habits are without names except for ambition,
which we call the excessive love of honors. Hence persons who are in the extremes argue about the
location of the mean. Even we sometimes call the man possessing the mean ambitious, and sometimes
we call him unambitious. Why we do this will be explained afterwards, but for the present we should
refer to the remaining states in the way indicated.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">With respect to anger we find an excess, a defect, and a mean. Although these are for the most part
without names, we call the man following the mean &#8220;mild&#8221; and the mean &#8220;mildness.&#8221; In regard to the
extremes, he who is excessive is called irascible and his vice irascibility. But he who is deficient is said
to be apathetic and to have the defect of apathy.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">There are three other means which are alike in one respect and different in another. They are all
concerned with communicating what we say and do, but they differ because one of them refers to the
truth, and the others to the pleasantness found in this communication. One of these latter concerns
pleasantness in the things said and done in jest, the others regard the things that belong to the usual
manner of living. We must speak of these things so that we may better understand that the mean is always
praiseworthy but that the extremes are neither right nor to be praised but rather to be condemned. Many
of these also are without special names, but as we have done with the others, we shall try to invent names
for them for the sake of the clarity and the good that results.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Righteous indignation may be assigned as the mean between envy and <i>epicacotharchia</i> or rejoicing in
evil. These are concerned with pleasure and sorrow over what happens to our neighbors. The righteously
indignant person is saddened at the unmerited prosperity of the wicked. But the envious person goes far
beyond this and eats his heart out over the success of everyone. The man called <i>epicacotharchos</i> is so
deficient in sadness that he actually rejoices. However, there will be time to treat of these matters
elsewhere. Because justice is understood in various ways, we shall later treat its parts showing how the
mean is constituted in them. Likewise we shall discuss the intellectual virtues.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">345. Having completed the virtues that concern riches, he now [b] treats those dealing with honors. First
[b, i] he deals with the virtue referring to great honors, and second [b, ii] with the virtue referring to
ordinary honors, at &#8220;As we pointed out etc.&#8221; He says first that magnanimity is the mean between honor
and dishonor. But the excess in following after the things belonging to great honors is a certain
disposition that is called <i>chaumotes</i> because it blazes forth in things pertaining to the desire of honor. In
Greek <i>cauma</i> is fire, and <i>capnos</i> means smoke. If the word be written <i>chapnotes</i> it can be translated
&#8220;exhalation&#8221; or presumption. We are accustomed to say that they who breathe with great difficulty on
climbing high altitudes are wheezing or puffing. But the defect opposed to magnanimity is
faintheartedness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">346. Then [b, ii ], at &#8220;As we pointed out,&#8221; he proposes another virtue referring to ordinary honors. He
says, as has been indicated (344), that liberality differs from magnificence because liberality bestows
small amounts while magnificence bestows great sums. So too there is a virtue concerned with ordinary
honors which differs from magnanimity which is concerned with great honors. That in this question there
should be some virtue consisting in a mean is made clear by his adding that ordinary honors are desired
as they ought (this belongs to the mean of virtue), more than they ought (this belongs to excess), and less
than they ought (this belongs to the defect). He who excessively desires honor is ambitious or a lover of
honor. He who is deficient in the desire of honor is unambitious or without the desire of honor. But he
who strikes a happy mean has no special name.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">347. Likewise the dispositions, i.e., the habits of vice or of the mean-virtue are unnamed. However, we
can invent names: calling the habit by which a person excessively loves honor, ambition; and the habit
by which a person is deficient in the love of honor, &#8220;unambitiousness.&#8221; But because the mean has not
been named, the persons who are in the extremes argue about the location of the mean. Both maintain
that they possess the mean. He explains this by drawing a comparison with two states that are in the habit
of bickering over their common border when the boundary has not been fixed. Both claim the intervening
territory as their own. But this is fairly common to all the vices for each of the extremes to think they
possess the mean and that the virtuous are in the other extreme, e.g., the coward considers the brave man
reckless; the reckless man says the brave man is a coward. Hence Aristotle states what is proper to this
matter, that not only do the vicious appropriate the name of virtue to themselves, but even the virtuous
use the name of the vice as if it were a virtue because the mean has not been named.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">348. This is what he refers to when he adds that even we (speaking correctly too) sometimes call a man
who possesses the mean ambitious, and other times unambitious. Also at times we praise a person
because he is ambitious. We are accustomed to say in commending a person that he is solicitous about
his honor, and thus we call the man who loves honor, virtuous. On the other hand we sometimes praise
an unambitious man, saying in his praise that he does not care about the esteem of men, but about the
truth. So we call the unambitious man virtuous. Why we do this will be explained afterwards in the fourth
book (794-795)But for the present we should continue with the remaining mediums in the way
designated, that is, as conforming to a pattern.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">349. Then [2], at &#8220;With respect to anger,&#8221; he proposes the virtue concerning external evils by which man
is provoked to anger. He says that in regard to anger there is an excess, a defect, and a mean. Although
all these for the most part are without names, we are accustomed to call the man following the mean mild,
and the mean itself mildness. But he who is excessive in this passion we call irascible and we say he has
the quality of irascibility. Ile man however who is deficient we call apathetic and say he has the defect
of apathy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">350. Then [C&#8217;], at &#8220;There are,&#8221; he proposes the virtues that concern human actions. First [C&#8217;, 1] he shows
their variety, and second [C&#8217;, 2] he gives examples of these at &#8220;In regard to truth etc.&#8221; He says first that
three means are alike in one respect and different in another. They are alike in that all refer to words and
deeds in which men communicate among themselves. They are different in that one of them refers to the
truth of such words and deeds. The others, however, refer to pleasantness in these words and deeds, so
that one of them regards pleasantness in the things that are said or done in jest, the others regard what
belongs to the usual manner of living, i.e., serious matters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">351. We must speak of these things so it will become more apparent that the mean is always praiseworthy
and the extremes are not to be praised but rather condemned. Many of these are without special names,
but, as we have done with the others, we shall try to invent names to clarify what is said for the sake of
the good that will ensue. The reason is that the purpose of this science is not the manifestation of truth
but virtuous activity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">352. Then [C, 2], at &#8220;In regard to truth,&#8221; he gives examples of these virtues and first [2, a] of that which
concerns truth. He says that in regard to truth the mean is had by the man who is called truthful, and the
mean itself is called truthfulness. But pretension, which is the excess (when a person pretends greater
things about himself than are true), is called boasting, and the pretender is called a braggart. But
dissembling, which is the defect (when a person makes pretense of certain contemptible things about
himself), is called dissimulation or irony. Such a pretender is called a dissembler.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">353. Second [2, b], at &#8220;In respect to,&#8221; he gives an example of the virtue concerned with amusement. He
says, regarding pleasantness in amusement, that the man who observes the mean is called witty
(<i>eutrapelos</i>) giving as it were a pleasant turn to every incident. The disposition itself is called wit
(<i>eutrapelia</i>). But the man who is guilty of excess is called a buffoon or <i>bomolochus</i>, from <i>bomo</i> meaning
&#8220;altar&#8221; and <i>lochos</i> meaning &#8220;plundering.&#8221; He is said to be like the bird of prey which always flew near
the sacrificial altars to snatch some food. In a similar way the man who is excessive in amusement always
insists on snatching a word or action of someone to give it a comic turn. The disposition however is
called buffoonery. But the man who is deficient is said to be boorish and to have the quality of
boorishness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">354. Third [2, C], at &#8220;In the remaining,&#8221; he exemplifies the third of these virtues saying that in the
remaining pleasantness, which is in life, touching on our serious actions, the mean is struck by the
friendly person-not so designated from the effect of friendship but from amicable conversation. Such a
one we term affable. The mean itself is called friendliness or affability. But one who overdoes this merely
for the purpose of pleasing is called obsequious. If he acts for his own utility, for example, his profit, he
is called a sycophant or a flatterer. One who falls short in this matter and does not fear to sadden those
he lives with is called contentious and perverse.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">355. Then [B], at &#8220;Also in the passions,&#8221; he gives an example of certain laudable passions-first [B, a],
of modesty. He says that a mean is found even in the passions and their phases, modesty, for instance,
is not a virtue, as will be explained in the fourth book (867-882). The modest person is praised because
a mean can be taken in such matters. One who goes to excess so that he blushes at everything is called
<i>cataplex</i>, a bashful person. But he who falls short, blushing at nothing is called shameless, while he who
strikes the mean is called modest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">356. Second [B, b], at &#8220;Righteous indignation,&#8221; he discusses another passion called <i>nemesis</i> or righteous
indignation, which is a mean between envy and <i>epicacotharchia</i> (<i>tharcus</i> meaning &#8220;rejoicing,&#8221; <i>kakos</i>
meaning &#8220;evil,&#8221; <i>epi</i> meaning &#8220;over&#8221;) or rejoicing in evil. These are dispositions concerned with pleasure
and sorrow over what happens to our neighbors. The righteously indignant person or the fair critic is
saddened at the prosperity of the wicked. But the envious person goes to excess in grieving over
all&#8212;both good and bad&#8212;who prosper. The person however called <i>epicotharchos</i> is so deficient in
sadness that he actually rejoices over the wicked who are successful in their wickedness. But these topics
are treated elsewhere, in the second book of the <i>Rhetoric</i> (Ch. 10).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">357. Last, because justice has. various parts in which the mean is differently understood, justice will be
treated in the fifth book (885-1108) together with the manner in which the parts consist in the mean.
Likewise, the rational or intellectual virtues will be discussed later in the sixth book (1109-1291).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">There are three dispositions, of which two are vices: one by excess, the other by defect. The third is
virtue and consists in the mean. Everyone of these is opposed in some way to every other one because
not only are the extremes opposed to one another and to the mean, but the mean is opposed to the
extremes.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">As the average is greater compared to the less and less compared to the greater, so mean habits are in
excess compared to the defect and in defect compared to excess. This is true both in the passions and in
actions. The brave man seems reckless compared to the coward, and cowardly compared to the reckless.
Likewise the moderate man seems self-indulgent compared to the insensible man, and insensible
compared to the self-indulgent. Also the generous person is a spendthrift in comparison with the miser
but a miser in comparison with the spendthrift.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In some cases it is the defect that is more opposed to the mean but in other cases it is the excess. Thus
it is not rashness but cowardice, the defect, that is more opposed to fortitude. On the contrary, however,
it is not insensibility (the defect) but self-indulgence (the excess) that is more opposed to temperance.<span style="font-weight: bold"> </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">This happens for two reasons, one of which is drawn from the very thing itself. It is not the extreme that
is nearer and more like the mean but its contrary that is more opposed to the mean. Thus, since rashness
seems nearer and more like fortitude, it is cowardice having less likeness that is more opposed to
fortitude. Things that are more removed from the mean seem to be more opposed to it. This first reason
then comes from the thing itself.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">But the other reason arises on our part. Those vices which are somewhat innate in us seem in a way to
be more opposed to the mean. For example, we more naturally follow pleasure and so we are more easily
moved to self-indulgence than to temperance. Therefore, we say that the vices that more readily increase
are more opposed to virtue. For this reason self-indulgence (which is an excess) is more opposed to
temperance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">358. After the Philosopher has shown in general what virtue is, and has applied the definition to
particular virtues, he treats the opposition f virtues and vices. Regarding this question he does three
things. First [1] he shows that there is a twofold opposition among these habits: one, of the vices among
themselves, the other, of the vices to the virtue. Then [2] he shows that the opposition among the vices
themselves is the greater, at &#8220;These things are mutually opposed etc.&#8221; Last [3] he shows how one of the
extremes is more opposed to virtue than the other, at &#8220;In some cases etc.&#8221; On the first point he does three
things. First [1, a] he states his proposal. Second [1, b] he proves the proposition, at &#8220;As the average etc.&#8221;
Third [1, c] he deduces a corollary from what has been said, at &#8220;For this reason the extremes tend to
throw etc.&#8221; He says first that there are three dispositions of which two are vices: one by excess and the
other by defect. The third is according to virtue which consists in a mean. Everyone of these is opposed
in some way to every other one, because not only are the extremes opposed to one another but also the
mean to the extremes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">359. Then [1, b], at &#8220;As the average&#8221; he proves what he had said. It was unnecessary to prove that two
vices, which are compared to one another as excess and defect, are opposed since they are far removed
from one another. But it will seem doubtful that virtue is opposed to vices, as was just said (358). Since
virtue holds a middle place between the vices, virtue is not very far removed from either of them, while
opposition is farthest apart, as stated in the tenth book of the <i>Metaphysics</i> (Ch. 4, 1055, a 4-32; St. Th.
Lect. 5, 2023-2035). Therefore, the Philosopher here makes a special point that virtue is opposed to both
extremes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">360. On this subject we must consider that the mean partakes to some extent of both extremes. Precisely
as it partakes of one of them it is contrary to the other, as the average&#8212;a mean between the great and
small&#8212;is small compared to the great and great compared to the small. Therefore, the average is opposed
both to the great by reason of the small and to the small by reason of the great. Because of this there is
a motion of the contrary against the mean as against a contrary, as is explained in the fifth book of the
Physics (Ch. 1, 224 b 30-35; St. Th. Lect. 1, 476).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">361. Therefore, the habits of the mean both in regard to passions and actions appear excessive to one who
is in defect and deficient to one who is in excess. Thus a brave man compared to a coward is reckless,
but compared to a reckless man, a brave man is a coward. Likewise a moderate man compared to an
insensible man is self-indulgent, but compared to the self-indulgent the moderate man is insensible. The
same may be said of the generous man who is a spendthrift in comparison with the miser, but a miser in
comparison with the spendthrift. It is evident then that virtue is opposed to the extremes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">362. Then [1, c], at &#8220;For this reason,&#8221; he deduces a corollary from what was said. Because the mean habit
is constituted by comparison of one extreme with the nature of the other, the extremes tend to throw the
mean toward one another. In other words, both extremes consider the mean as it were an extreme
opposed to them. Thus the coward calls the brave man reckless and the reckless man calls him a coward.
This is an indication of what we just stated (359, 361), that virtue is opposed to both extremes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">363. Then [2], at &#8220;These things are mutually opposed,&#8221; he shows there is greater opposition of the vices
among themselves than to virtue for two reasons. The first reason [2, a] is that the more removed things
aile from one another, the mom opposed they are because opposition is a kind of distance. But the
extremes are more removed from one another than from the mean, as great and small are more removed
from one another than from the average, which is a mean between them, Therefore, vices are more
opposed to one another than to virtue. We must consider that Aristotle speaks here about the opposition
of virtue to vices, not according to good and evil&#8212;in this way both vices come under one extreme&#8212;but
according as virtue by reason of its own species is a mean between two vices.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">364. He states the second reason [2, b] at &#8220;Moreover there seems.&#8221; It is this. There is some similarity
between virtue and one extreme, for instance, between fortitude and rashness, between generosity and
prodigality. But there is complete dissimilarity between the two extremes or vices. Therefore, they are
opposed to one another in the greatest degree because their opposition denotes the greatest distance, as
was indicated (359).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">365. Then [3], at &#8220;In some cases,&#8221; he shows that one extreme is more opposed to virtue than the other.
On this point he does two things. First [3, a] he states his proposal. Second [3, b] he assigns the reasons
at &#8220;This happens for two reasons.&#8221; He says first that in some cases it is the defect that is more opposed
to the mean of the virtue, but in other cases it is the excess. Thus not rashness, which certainly pertains
to the excess, but cowardice, which pertains to the defect, is most opposed to fortitude. On the contrary,
however, it is not insensibility (to which lack and defect belong) but self-indulgence (to which excess
pertains) that is most opposed to temperance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">366. Then [3, b], at &#8220;This happens for two reasons,&#8221; he assigns two reasons for what he said. One [b, i]
is taken from the thing itself, that is, from the very nature of the virtues and vices. It was just stated (364)
that one extreme has a similarity to the mean of virtue. From the very fact that one extreme is nearer and
more like the mean of virtue than the other, it follows that not the one more similar to the mean but the
one contrary to it is more opposed to the virtue. Thus if rashness is nearer and more like fortitude, it
follows that cowardice is more unlike and consequently more opposed to fortitude. The reason is that the
habits more removed from the mean seem to be more opposed to it. But the explanation of these things
must be taken from the nature of the passions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">367. What Aristotle says here touches on the moral virtues concerned with the passions. To these virtues
it belongs to preserve the good of reason against the movement of the passions. Now passion can destroy
the good of reason in two ways. First, its vehemence can incite to greater activity than reason prescribes,
especially in the desire of pleasure and in the other passions pertaining to the following of the appetite.
Hence the virtue, which touches the passions of this kind, aims principally at restraining these passions.
For this reason the vice referring to the defect is more like the virtue, and the vice referring to the excess
is more opposed to it, as is evident in temperance. But other passions destroy the good by withdrawing
to something less than what is according to reason, as is evident in the case of fear and other passions
having to do with flight. Hence the virtue concerned with such passions strives as much as possible to
strengthen man against defect in the good of reason. On this account the vice of defect is more opposed
to the virtue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">368. Then [b, ii], at &#8220;But the other,&#8221; he assigns another reason on our part. Since virtue ought to restrain
vices, the aim of virtue is to curb more effectively those vices to which we have a stronger inclination.
For this reason those vices, which are in any way somewhat innate in us, are more opposed to virtue. As
from birth we more readily follow pleasures than flee from them, we are very early moved to self-indulgence which implies an excess of pleasure. Therefore, we say that those vices, which rather
naturally tend to increase in us because we are by nature inclined to them, are more opposed to virtue.
For this reason self-indulgence, to which excess of pleasure pertains, is more opposed to temperance than
insensibility is, as has been observed (365).</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">369. After the Philosopher has treated the nature of virtue, he shows here how a person can acquire
virtue. He does this because, as was indicated before (351), the purpose of this teaching is not that men
may know the truth but that they may become good. On this point he does two things. First [1 ] he shows
that it is difficult for man to become virtuous. Second [2] he shows how man may attain this, at &#8220;For this
reason he who aims etc.&#8221; The first notion calls1or a twofold procedure. First [i, a] he reviews what has
been said. It has been sufficiently explained before (310, 316), he states, that moral virtue is a mean, how
it is a mean (not objectively but relative to us), and between what things it is the mean, i.e., between two
vices&#8212; one by excess, the other by defect. It has also been explained (317-318) why virtue is a middle
course, namely because it aims at the mean; virtue searches out and chooses the mean both in the
passions and actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">370. Second [1, b], at &#8220;It is not easy,&#8221; he concludes from the premises that it is difficult to be good or
virtuous because we see that in every case it is difficult to discover the mean but easy to deviate from the
mean. Thus, not everyone&#8212;only an informed person who is a geometrician&#8212;can find the center of a
circle. On the other hand, anyone can easily deviate from the center. Likewise, anyone can hand out
money and waste it. But not everyone (for it is not easy) can give to the right person, the right amount,
at the right time, for the right purpose, in the right manner-all of which belongs to virtuous giving.
Indeed, because of the difficulty it is a rare and difficult thing, but praiseworthy and virtuous precisely
as conforming to reason.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">371. Then [2], at &#8220;For this reason,&#8221; he shows the ways in which a person may become virtuous. On this
point he does two things. First [2, a] he shows how a person can discover the mean. Second (2, b] he
treats the discovery of the mean at &#8220;This is perhaps difficult etc.&#8221; In regard to the first he gives three
admonitions. One of these [a, i]. is taken from the nature of the thing. He states that it is difficult to
become virtuous and to discover the mean. Therefore, one who aims at the mean (i.e., he who intends
to attain the mean) must strive principally to avoid the extreme more opposed to the virtue. Thus if
someone wishes to arrive at the mean of fortitude he ought to direct his principal efforts to avoiding
cowardice, which is more opposed to fortitude than rashness is, as has been explained (365).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">372. He gives an example of a certain Circe who used to warn sailors to beware chiefly of the greatest
dangers from the sea, which are waves sinking the ship and mist obscuring the vision of the sailors. This
was the warning: &#8220;Clear of the smoke take care and clear of the rollers to keep her,&#8221; as if to say: so guard
your ship that you may escape spray and waves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">373. He gives the reason for this admonition, saying that one of the extremes&#8212;that which is more
opposed to the virtue&#8212;is a greater sin; but that the extreme, which is less opposed to the virtue, is a
lesser sin. Therefore, since it is exceedingly difficult to reach the mean of virtue, a man ought to try to
avoid at least the greater dangers that are more opposed to virtue. Thus sailors say that after the best
voyage on which a man is exposed to no dangers, the next best is to choose the least of the dangers. A
similar thing happens to a man&#8217;s life in the way that was explained (371), that he may chiefly avoid the
vices that are opposed to virtue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">374. He gives the second admonition [a, ii] at &#8220;We must take into account.&#8221; It is understood on our part,
as far as concerns the things proper to each of us. One who wishes to be virtuous, he says, must take into
account that to which his appetite is naturally inclined. Different people are by nature more inclined to
one thing than another. Each one can know what he is naturally inclined to from the pleasure and sorrow
he experiences, because what is agreeable to each according to his nature is pleasurable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">375. Hence, if someone takes pleasure in a particular action or passion, this is a sign that he is naturally
inclined to it. But men vehemently tend to the things to which they are naturally inclined, and so, easily
exceed the n in this matter. We, therefore, must draw ourselves as, much as possible to the opposite. The
reason is that when we make an effort to recede from sin, to which we are prone, we will finally with
difficulty arrive at the mean. He makes a comparison with nurserymen who straighten crooked saplings.
These men wishing to make trees straight force them the opposite way and so bring them to the mean,
an upright position.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">376. Here we must consider that this way of acquiring virtues is most effective: that a man should strive
for the opposite of that to which he is inclined either by nature or habit. However, the way advocated by
the Stoics is easier: that a man little by little withdraw from those things to which he is inclined, as
Cicero relates in his work <i>Questiones Tusculanae</i> (Bk. IV, C. 31-35, n. 65-76). The way that Aristotle
lays down is suitable for those who strongly desire to withdraw from vice and to attain virtue. But the
way of the Stoics is more appropriate to those who have weak and halfhearted wills.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">377. He lays down the third admonition [a, iii] at &#8220;Everyone.&#8221; This is also understood on our part, not
in the sense that it is proper to every individual, as has been said (374-376) of the second admonition,
but precisely as it is common to all. All are naturally inclined to pleasure. Therefore, he says that
everyone without exception who aims at virtue ought to be on his guard especially against pleasures.
Because men are very inclined to pleasure, pleasurable objects apprehended easily move their appetite.
Hence, he notes that we cannot easily judge pleasure by dwelling on its consideration without the appetite
accepting it and bursting forth in desire for it. What the Trojan elders felt toward Helen when they
decided that she must depart, we ought to feel toward pleasure; in all that concerns pleasure we ought
to reecho their words in order that we may reject bodily pleasures. Rejecting pleasures in this way, we
will fall into sin less frequently since the desire of pleasure leads men to many sins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">378. He concludes then that those who do what has been suggested under this heading, i.e., summarily,
will be quite able to acquire the mean of virtue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">379. Then [2, b], at &#8220;This is perhaps difficult,&#8221; he shows how the mean of virtue must be determined. On
this point he does three things. First [b, i] he indicates the difficulty of this. Next [b, ii] he shows what
suffices to determine the mean, at &#8220;One who deviates a little etc.&#8221; Last [b, iii] he answers a latent
question at &#8220;It cannot be determined etc.&#8221; He says first that it is difficult to discover the mean especially
when we consider the particular circumstances in individual actions. The reason is that it is not easy to
determine how a thing is to be done and in regard to what persons, and in what type of things, and how
long a time one should be angry. He gives a sign of this difficulty: that those, who are deficient in getting
angry for instance, are sometimes praised by us and called mild, while those who are rather irascible in
inflicting punishment or making resistance are sometimes praised by us and called manly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">38o. Then [b, ii], at &#8220;One who.&#8221; he indicates what suffices for the mean of virtue. He says that one who
deviates a little from what is done well according to virtue is not censured, whether he inclines to excess
or defect. The reason is that a slight departure from the mean of virtue is hidden on account of the
difficulty with the mean. But one who deviates greatly is censured because the deviation is not hidden.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">381. Then [b, iii], at &#8220;It cannot easily,&#8221; he answers a latent question. Someone could ask how much
departure from the mean should be censured and how much should not. He himself answers that it cannot
easily be determined, in so many words, at what point and how much a person departing from the mean
should be blamed. Likewise no other sensible thing, which is judged rather by sense than reason, can
easily be determined. Things of this kind, belonging to the operations of the virtues, are individual cases.
For this reason judgment about them exists in the sensitive part of the soul, even if not in the external,
at least in the internal sense by which a person judges well about singulars, and to which belongs the
judgment of prudence, as will be said in the sixth book (1215, 1249). But this much suffices here to show
that the mean habit in all cases is rather praiseworthy. However, sometimes we must incline toward
excess and sometimes toward defect either on account of the nature of virtue or on account of our
inclination, as is clear from what was explained above (369-378). Thus the mean according to which a
thing is done well will be easily discovered. So ends the second book.</span></p>
