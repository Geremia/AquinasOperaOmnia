      <p>
        This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that is for
        ever. All that keep it shall come to life: but they that have forsaken
        it, to death. — Baruch 4.1
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      According to Augustine in On Christian Doctrine 4:12 one skilled in speech
      should so speak as to teach, to delight and to change; that is, to teach
      the ignorant, to delight the bored and to change the lazy. The speech of
      Sacred Scripture does these three things in the fullest manner. For it
      firmly teaches with its eternal truth. Psalm 118:89: ‘Your word, O Lord,
      stands firm for ever as heaven.’ And it sweetly delights with its
      pleasantness. Psalm 118.103: ‘How sweet are your words to my mouth!’ And
      it efficaciously changes with its authority. Jeremiah 23:29: ‘Are my words
      not like fire, says the Lord?’
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore in the text above Sacred Scripture is commended for three
      things. First, for the authority with which it changes: ‘This is the book
      of the commandments of God.’ Second, for the eternal truth with which it
      instructs, when it says, ‘and the law that is for ever’. Third, for the
      usefulness with which it entices, when it says, ‘All that keep it shall
      come to life.’
    </p>
    <p>
      The authority of this Scripture is shown in three things. First, its
      origin, because God is its origin. Hence it says, the commandments of
      God’. Baruch 3.37: ‘He found out all the way of knowledge.’ Hebrews 2:3:
      ‘For it was first announced by the Lord and was confirmed unto us.’ Such
      an author is infallibly to be believed, both on account of the condition
      of his nature, because he is truth; John 14:4: ‘I am the way and the truth
      and the life.’ And on account of his fullness of knowledge; Romans 11:33:
      ‘Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God!’
      And also on account of the power of the words; Hebrews 4:12: ‘For the word
      of God is living and efficient and keener than any two-edged sword.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, it is shown to be efficacious by the necessity with which it is
      imposed. Mark 16.16: ‘He who does not believe shall be condemned.’ The
      truth of Sacred Scripture is proposed in the manner of a precept, hence
      the text says, ‘the commandments of God’. These commandments direct the
      intellect through faith: ‘You believe in God, believe also in me’, John
      14:1; inform the affections with love: ‘This is my commandment, that you
      love one another’, John 15:12; and induce to action: ‘Do this and you
      shall live’, Luke 10:28.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, it is shown to be efficacious by the uniformity of its sayings,
      because all who teach the sacred doctrine teach the same thing. 1
      Corinthians 15:11: ‘Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you
      have believed.’ And this is necessary because they all had one teacher.
      Matthew 23:8: ‘Your teacher is one.’ And they had one spirit, ‘Have we not
      walked in the same spirit?’ and one love from above, ‘Now the multitude of
      believers were of one heart and one soul’ (Acts 4:32). Therefore, as a
      sign of the uniformity of doctrine, it says significantly, ‘This is the
      book.’
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth of this teaching of Scripture is immutable and eternal, hence
      the words, ‘and the law that is for ever’. Luke 21.33: ‘Heaven and earth
      will pass away but my words shall not pass away.’ This law will endure for
      ever because of three things: First, because of the power of the lawgiver.
      Isaiah 14:27: ‘For the Lord of hosts hath decreed, and who can disannul
      it.’ Second, on account of his immutability. Malachi 3:6: ‘For I am the
      Lord and I do not change’; Numbers 23:19: ‘God is not a man, that he
      should lie: nor like the son of man, that he should be changed.’ Third,
      because of the truth of the law. Psalm 118:86: ‘All your commandments are
      faithful.’ Proverbs12:19: ‘The lip of truth shall be steadfast for ever.’
      3 Ezra 4:38: ‘Truth remains and gathers strength eternally.’
    </p>
    <p>
      The usefulness of this Scripture is the greatest: ‘I am the Lord your God
      who teaches you profitable things.’ Hence our text continues: ‘All who
      keep it shall come to life.’ Which indeed is threefold: First it is the
      life of grace, to which Sacred Scripture disposes. John 6:64: ‘The words
      that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.’ For through this life the
      spirit lives in God. Galatians 2:20: ‘It is now no longer I that live, but
      Christ lives in me.’ Second is the life of justice consisting in works, to
      which Sacred Scripture directs. Psalm 118.93: ‘Your decrees I will never
      forget, for by them you have given me life.’ Third is the life of glory
      which Sacred Scripture promises and to which it leads. John 6.69: ‘Lord,
      to whom shall we go? you have the words of everlasting life.’ John 20:31:
      ‘But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the
      Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.’
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">The Division of Sacred Scripture</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sacred Scripture leads to this life in two ways, by commanding and by
      helping. Commanding through the mandates which it proposes, which belong
      to the Old Testament. Sirach 24-33: ‘Moses commanded a law in the precepts
      of justice.’ Helping, through the gift of grace which the lawgiver
      dispenses, which pertains to the New Testament. Both of these are touched
      on in John 1:17: ‘For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth
      came through Jesus Christ.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence the whole of Sacred Scripture is divided into two principal parts,
      the Old and New Testaments, which are mentioned in Matthew 13:52: ‘So then
      every Scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who
      brings forth from his storeroom things new and old.’ And Song of Songs
      7:13: ‘In our gates are all fruits, the new and the old, my beloved, I
      have kept for you.’
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Testament is divided according to the teaching of the
      commandments, for the commandment is of two kinds, the binding and the
      warning. The binding is the command of a king who can punish
      transgressors. Proverbs 20:2: ‘As the roaring of a lion, so also is the
      dread of a king.’ But a warning is the precept of a father who must teach.
      Sirach 7:25: ‘Do you have you children? Instruct them.’ The precept of a
      king is of two kinds, one which establishes the laws, another which
      induces to observance of the law, which is customarily done through his
      heralds and ambassadors. Thus it is that three kinds of command are
      distinguished, that of the king, that of the herald and that of the
      father. On this basis the Old Testament is subdivided into three parts,
      according to Jerome in his prologue to the Book of Kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first part is contained in the law which is proposed by the king
      himself. Isaiah 33:22: ‘For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our
      lawgiver, the Lord is our King.’
    </p>
    <p>
      The second is contained in the Prophets who were, as it were, ambassadors
      and heralds of God, speaking to the people in the person of God, and
      urging them to observance of the law. Haggai 11:13: ‘And Haggai, the
      messenger of the Lord, as one of the messengers of the Lord, spoke.’
    </p>
    <p>
      The third is contained in the works of hagiographers, writers who were
      inspired by the Holy Spirit and spoke as for themselves and not for God.
      Hence they are called saintly writers because they were writers of the
      sacred, <i>agios</i> meaning ‘sacred’, and <i>graphia</i> meaning
      ‘scripture’. Thus the precepts found in them are paternal. As is evident
      in Proverbs 6:20: ‘My son, keep the commandments of your father.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Jerome mentions a fourth kind of book, namely, the apocryphal, so called
      from <i>apo</i>, that is, ‘especially’, and <i>cryphon</i>, that is,
      ‘obscure’, because there is doubt about their contents and authors. The
      Catholic Church includes among the books of Sacred Scripture some whose
      teachings are not doubted, but whose authors are. Not that the authors are
      unknown, but because these men were not of known authority. Hence they do
      not have force from the authority of the authors but rather from their
      reception by the Church. Because there is the same manner of speaking in
      them and in the hagiographical works, they are for now counted among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first part, which contains the law, is divided into two parts, insofar
      as there are two kinds of law, public and private.
    </p>
    <p>
      A private law is imposed for the observance of one person or one family.
      Such law is contained in <i>Genesis</i>, as is evident from the first
      precept given to man, ‘But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil ‘you
      shalt not eat’ (2:17), and to Noah, ‘Saving that flesh with blood you
      shall not eat’ (9:4), and to Abraham, ‘And again God said to Abraham: And
      you therefore shalt keep my covenant, and your descendants after you in
      their generations’ (17:9).
    </p>
    <p>
      The public law is that which is given to the people. For the divine law
      was given to the Jewish people through a mediator, because it was not
      fitting that the people should receive it immediately from God.
      Deuteronomy 5:5: ‘I was the mediator and stood between the Lord and You
      and at that time to show you his words.’ Galatians 3.19: ‘What then was
      the Law? It was enacted on account of transgressors, being delivered by
      angels through a mediator.’Thus a twofold level is found in legislation.
      First, when the law comes from the Lord to the mediator, and this pertains
      to three books, Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers. Hence we frequently read in
      them, ‘God spoke to Moses.’ Second, when the law is given to the people by
      the mediator, and this pertains to Deuteronomy, as is evident from its
      very beginning, ‘These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel.’
    </p>
    <p>
      These three books are distinguished by the three things in which a people
      should be ordered. First, precepts bearing on equity of judgement, and
      this is found in <i>Exodus</i>. Second, in sacraments with respect to the
      establishment of worship, and this in <i>Leviticus</i>. And third, in
      offices, with respect to the administration of the community, and this in
      <i>Numbers</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second part, which is the prophets, is subdivided insofar as a herald
      ought to do two things. He should manifest the beneficence of the king, so
      that men will be inclined to obey, and he should declare the edict of the
      law.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a threefold divine beneficence that the prophets expose to the
      people. First, the effect of heredity, and this in <i>Joshua</i>, of which
      Sirach 46:1 says, ‘Valiant in war was Joshua.’ Second, the destruction of
      armies, and this in the book of Judges, of whose destruction Psalm 82:10
      says, ‘Do to them as to Madian, as to Sisara.’ Third, the exultation of
      the people, which is twofold, namely the private exaltation of one person,
      and this in <i>Ruth</i>, and a public which is of the whole people, and
      this in <i>Kings</i>, which benefice God grants to them. Ezekiel 16.13:
      ‘And you were adorned with gold and silver.’ For these books, according to
      Jerome, are placed in the rank of prophets.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other books which are commonly said to be of the prophets, the prophets
      posed divine edicts for the observance of the law. And this is said,
      first, in general, in the major prophets who were sent to the whole people
      and called for the observance of the whole law; second, in particular, and
      this in the <i>minor prophets</i>, different ones of whom were sent for
      different reasons to special tribes, as Hosea to the ten tribes of Joel,
      Jonah to the Ninevites, and so with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major prophets differ according to the different ways the prophets
      sought to lead the people to observance of the law, namely, cajoling by
      the promise of benefits, frightening with the threat of punishment,
      arguing by condemnation of sins. Although each of these is found in every
      prophet, <i>Isaiah</i> chiefly cajoles, as is said in Sirach 48-27: ‘With
      a great spirit he saw the things that are come to pass at last, and
      comforted the mourners in Sion.’ <i>Jeremiah</i> chiefly warns, hence
      Jeremiah 3 8-4: ‘He weakened the hands of the men of war that remain in
      this city.’ But <i>Ezekiel</i> argues and scolds. Ezekiel 16-3: ‘Your
      father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.’
    </p>
    <p>
      They can be distinguished in another way, insofar as <i>Isaiah</i> chiefly
      foretells the mystery of the Incarnation, which is why he is read during
      the time of Advent by the Church, and <i>Jeremiah</i> the mystery of the
      Passion, hence he is read in Passiontide, and <i>Ezekiel</i> the mystery
      of the Resurrection, hence his book finishes with the raising of the bones
      and the repair of the temple. <i>Daniel</i>, however, is included among
      the prophets insofar as he predicted future events in a prophetic spirit;
      although he did not speak to the people in the person of the Lord, he
      dealt with the divinity of Christ. Thus the four prophets answer to the
      four evangelists, and also to the call to judgement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third part, which contains the hagiographic and the apocryphal books,
      is subdivided according to the two ways fathers instruct their sons in
      virtue, namely, by word and deed, since in morals examples are no less
      important than words. Some teach by deed alone, some by word alone, some
      by word and deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      By deed, however, in two ways. One, instructing about the future by
      warning, and this in Joshua, whom Jerome places among the hagiographs. For
      although one is a prophet because of the gift of prophecy, this is not his
      office, because he was not sent by God to prophesy to the people. Hence
      what is said in Wisdom 8:8 can be applied to the prophet: ‘She knows signs
      and wonders before they are done.’ In another way, speaking of past events
      as examples of virtue. There are four principal virtues, namely justice,
      which serves the common good, an example of which is given in
      <i>Chronicles</i>, in which the condition of a whole people who were
      governed with justice is described. The second is temperance, an example
      of which is given in <i>Judith</i>, which is why Jerome says, ‘Take Judith
      as an example of the chaste widow.’ Judith 15. 11: ‘For you have acted
      manfully, and your heart has been strengthened, because you loved
      chastity.’ Third is fortitude, which has two attributes. To attack, and an
      example of this is found in the Book of <i>Maccabees</i>; and to endure,
      and an example of this is found in <i>Tobit</i> 2:12: ‘Now this trial the
      Lord therefore permitted to happen to him, that an example might be given
      to posterity of his patience.’ The fourth is prudence, by which dangers
      are avoided, and an example of this is given in <i>Ezra</i>. For in that
      book we are shown how Ezra and Nehemiah and other princes prudently
      guarded against the plots of enemies wishing to impede the building of the
      temple and the city. It also pertains to prudence wisely to repel the
      violent, and an example of this is given in <i>Esther</i>, where it is
      shown how Mordecai and Esther handled the deceptions of the most powerful
      Haman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hagiographical and apocryphal books which instruct by word, are
      divided insofar as words work in a twofold way to instruct, in one way, by
      asking for the gift of wisdom. Wisdom 7:7: ‘Wherefore I have wished, and
      understanding was given me, and I called upon God, and the spirit of
      wisdom came upon me.’ This is how the <i>Psalter</i> instructs, speaking
      to God in prayer. In another way, by teaching wisdom, and this in two ways
      according to the twofold work of wisdom, one of which is to expose the
      liar, and <i>Job</i> who drove out errors by way of disputation exhibits
      this. Job 13.3-4: ‘But yet I will speak to the Almighty and I desire to
      reason with God, having first shown that you are forgers of lies and
      maintainers of perverse opinions.’ The other work is not to lie about what
      it knows, and thus we are instructed in a twofold way, because either
      wisdom is commended to us, and this in the book of <i>Wisdom</i>, or the
      precepts of wisdom are proposed, and this in the three books of Solomon,
      which indeed differ according to the three grades of virtue that Plotinus,
      in Enneads 1.1.2.2-7, distinguishes, since the precepts of wisdom ought to
      concern only the acts of virtue. In the first grade, according to him, are
      political virtues, whereby a man moderately uses the things of this world
      and lives among men, and this in the <i>Proverbs</i>. In the second grade
      are the purgative virtues, whereby a man regards the world with contempt,
      and this in <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, which aims at contempt of the world, as
      is clear from Jerome’s prologue. In the third grade are the virtues of the
      purged soul, whereby a man, wholly cleansed of worldly cares, delights in
      the contemplation of wisdom alone, and this is found in the
      <i>Song of Songs</i>. In the fourth grade are the exemplar virtues
      existing in God, concerning which precepts of wisdom are not given but are
      rather derived from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In word and in deed <i>Sirach</i> instructs. Hence the precepts of wisdom
      in praise of fathers close his book, as is clear in Chapter 44 and after.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Testament, which is ordered to eternal life not only through
      precepts but also through the gifts of grace, is divided into three parts.
      In the first the origin of grace is treated, in the Gospels. in the
      second, the power of grace, and this in the epistles of Paul, hence he
      begins in the power of the Gospel, in Romans 1:16 saying, ‘For I am not
      ashamed of the Gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to
      everyone who believes.’ In the third, the execution of the aforesaid
      virtues is treated, and this in the rest of the books of the New
      Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ is the origin of grace. John 1:16-17: ‘And of his fullness we have
      all received, grace for grace. For the Law was given through Moses: grace
      and truth came through Jesus Christ.’ In Christ a twofold nature is to be
      considered, a divine, and the Gospel of <i>John</i> is chiefly concerned
      with this, hence he begins, ‘In the beginning was the Word and the Word
      was with God, and the Word was God.’ And a human, and the other Gospels
      treat chiefly of this, and they are distinguished according to the
      threefold dignity that belongs to the man Christ. With respect to his
      royal honour, <i>Matthew</i> speaks. Hence in the beginning of his Gospel
      he shows that Christ descended from kings and was adored by the Magi
      kings. With respect to his prophetic honour, <i>Mark</i> speaks, hence he
      begins with the preaching of the Gospel. With respect to his priestly
      dignity, <i>Luke</i> speaks, and he begins with the temple and the
      priesthood and ends his Gospel in the temple, and frequently returns to
      the temple, as the Gloss says about Luke 2.46: ‘And they found him sitting
      in the temple in the midst of the teachers.’
    </p>
    <p>
      In another way, <i>Matthew</i> might be said to speak of Christ chiefly
      with respect to the mystery of the Incarnation, and thus he is depicted in
      the figure of a man. <i>Luke</i>, with respect to the mystery of the
      Passion, and therefore he is depicted as a bull, which is an animal to be
      immolated. <i>Mark</i>, with respect to the victory of the Resurrection,
      and thus he is depicted as a lion. But <i>John</i>, who soars to the
      heights of his divinity, is depicted as an eagle.
    </p>
    <p>
      [The part dealing with the power of grace as exemplified in the epistles
      of Paul is missing from the text.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The execution of the power of grace is shown in the progress of the
      Church, in which there are three things to consider. First, the beginning
      of the Church, and this is treated in the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>,
      hence Jerome says, in his preface to the Pentateuch, that ‘The Acts of the
      Apostles seem to give the bare history of the birth and to clothe the
      infant Church.’ Second, the progress of the Church, and to this is ordered
      the apostolic instruction of the <i>canonical epistles</i>. Third, the end
      of the Church, with which the whole content of Scripture concludes in the
      <i>Apocalypse</i>, with the spouse in the abode of Jesus Christ sharing
      the life of glory, to which Jesus Christ himself conducts, and may he be
      blessed for ever and ever. Amen.

      You water the hills from your upper rooms, the earth is sated with the
      fruit of your works. — Psalm 103:13
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Preface</span></p>
    <p>
      The King and Lord of the heavens set down this law from all eternity that
      the gifts of his Providence should come to the lower through
      intermediaries. Hence Dionysius in the <i>Celestial Hierarchy</i> 5 says,
      ‘It is the most sacred law of the divinity that things in the middle
      should be led to his most divine light by first things.’
    </p>
    <p>
      This is found to be a law not only in spiritual things but also in
      corporeal. Hence Augustine in <i>On the Trinity</i> 3.4: ‘Therefore, as
      the more crass and least are ruled in a given order by more subtle bodies,
      so all bodies are ruled by the rational spirit of life.’ Therefore, in the
      psalm the Lord proposed this law observed in the communication of
      spiritual wisdom in a metaphor of bodily things: ‘Watering the
      mountains...’ It is plain to the senses that from the highest clouds rain
      flows forth by which the mountains and rivers are refreshed and send
      themselves forth so that the satiated earth can bear fruit. Similarly,
      from the heights of divine wisdom the minds of the learned, represented by
      the mountains, are watered, by whose ministry the light of divine wisdom
      reached to the minds of those who listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are then four things to be considered in the chosen text: the height
      of spiritual doctrine; the dignity of those who teach it; the condition of
      the listeners; and the order of communicating.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its height is expressed by the words, ‘from your upper rooms’. The Gloss
      has, ‘from your treasure houses on high’. The height of sacred doctrine
      comes from three things.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, its origin: for this is the wisdom that is described as being from
      on high. James 3:15 and Sirach 1:5: ‘The word of God on high is the
      fountain of wisdom.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, because of the subtlety of its matter, Sirach 24:7: ‘I dwelt in
      the highest places, and my throne is in a pillar of a cloud.’ There are
      some heights of divine wisdom to which all come, though imperfectly,
      because, as Damascene says in <i>On Orthodox Faith</i> I.1, ‘knowledge of
      the existing God is naturally inserted in all’. In this respect, it is
      said in Job 36:25, ‘All men see him: every one gazes from afar.’ Other
      things are higher and only the wit of the wise achieves them. Romans 1:19:
      ‘What is known about God is manifest to them.’ Some are so high that they
      completely transcend human reason, of which it is said in Job 28:21, ‘It
      is hidden from the eyes of all the living,’ and Psalm 17:12, ‘He put on
      darkness as his covering.’ But this has been made known by the Holy
      Spirit, ‘Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit
      that is from God,’ instructing holy teachers who passed it on in the text
      of Sacred Scripture; and these are the highest, in which this wisdom is
      said to dwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, from the sublimity of the end, for it has the highest end, namely,
      life eternal. John 10:31: ‘But these are written that you may believe that
      Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life
      in his name.’ Colossians 3:1-2, ‘Therefore, if you have risen with Christ,
      seek the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand
      of God. Mind the things that are above, not the things of earth.’
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">2</span></p>
    <p>
      Because of the height of this doctrine, there is required dignity in those
      who teach it, which is why they are symbolized by mountains when it is
      said, ‘from your upper rooms’, and this for three reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, because of the height of mountains. For they are elevated above the
      earth and neighbours of the sky. Thus the holy teachers by despising
      earthly things cleave to heavenly things alone. Philippians 3:20: ‘But our
      citizenship is in heaven from which also we eagerly await a Saviour, Our
      Lord Jesus Christ.’ Hence of the teacher of teachers, Christ, it is said
      in Isaiah 2:2, ‘And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord
      shall be prepared on the top of the mountain... and all nations shall flow
      unto it.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, because of its splendour. For the mountains are illumined by
      beams. Similarly the sacred teachers of minds first receive the splendour.
      Like mountains the teachers are illumined by the first beams of divine
      wisdom. Psalm 75:5: ‘You came shining with light, powerful, from the
      everlasting hills. The foolish of heart have been despoiled,’ that is, by
      the teachers who participate in eternity. Philippians 2:15: ‘You shine
      like stars in the world.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, because of the protection of the mountains, for the land is
      defended from the enemy by mountains. So too the doctors of the Church
      must in defence of the faith stand against errors. The sons of Israel do
      not put their trust in lance or bow, but the mountains defend them.
      Ezekiel 13.5: ‘You have not gone up to face the enemy, nor have you set up
      a wall for the house of Israel to stand in battle in the day of the Lord.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore all the teachers of Sacred Scripture should give high thanks to
      their eminence of life, that they might be worthy to preach efficaciously,
      because as Gregory says in <i>On Pastoral Care</i>, ‘The preaching of
      those whose life is despised will also be despised.’ Ecclesiastes 12:11:
      ‘The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails deeply fastened in,
      which by the counsels of masters are given from one shepherd.’ For the
      heart cannot be stimulated or stirred to fear of God unless it is fixed in
      highness of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      They should be enlightened, that they might fittingly teach by reading.
      Ephesians 3:8-9: ‘Yes, to me, the very least of all the saints, there was
      given this grace, to announce among the Gentiles the good tidings of the
      unfathomable riches of Christ, and to enlighten all men as to what is the
      dispensation of the mystery which has been hidden from eternity in God.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed, that they might refute errors in disputation. Luke 21:15: ‘For I
      myself will give you utterance and wisdom, which all your adversaries will
      not be able to resist.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these three offices, namely, to preach, to lecture and to dispute, it
      is said in Titus 1:9, ‘that he may be able both to exhort in sound
      doctrine and to confute opponents’.
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">3</span></p>
    <p>
      Third, the condition of those who hear, which are presented in the symbol
      of earth: ‘the earth is sated’. This is because the earth is lowest.
      Proverbs 25:3: ‘The heaven above, and the earth beneath.’ Again, it is
      stable and firm. Ecclesiastes 1:4: ‘One generation passes away, and
      another generation comes, but the earth stands for ever.’ Again, it is
      fruitful. Genesis 1:11: ‘Let the earth bring forth the green herb, and
      such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, they should be low as the earth in humility. Proverbs 11:2:
      ‘Where humility is, there, also is wisdom.’ Again, firm with the sense of
      rectitude; Ephesians 4:14: ‘That we may be now no longer children, tossed
      to and fro and carried about by every wind of doctrine.’ And fruitful, as
      the precepts of wisdom bear fruit in them, Luke 8:15: ‘Having heard the
      word, hold it fast and bear fruit in patience.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore humility is required of them with respect to the learning that
      comes from listening, Sirach 6:34: ‘If you wilt incline your ear, you
      shalt receive instruction: and if you love to hear, you shalt be wise.’
      Rectitude of the senses with respect to the judgement of what is heard;
      Job 12.11: ‘Doth not the ear discern words?’ But fruitfulness in
      discovery, by which from a few things heard, the good listener pronounces
      many things; Proverbs 9.9: ‘Give an occasion to a wise man, and wisdom
      shall be added to him.’
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold">4</span></p>
    <p>
      The order of its coming about is touched on here with respect to three
      things, namely, the order of communicating, the amount, and the quality of
      the gift received.
    </p>
    <p>
      First with respect to the order of communicating, because not everything
      that is contained in divine wisdom can be grasped by the minds of the
      teachers. Hence he does not say from the highest mountains, but from the
      upper; Job 26:14: ‘Lo, these things are said in part.’ Similarly, not
      everything that the teachers grasp is passed on to the hearers; 1
      Corinthians 12:4: ‘...and heard secret words that a man may not repeat’.
      Hence he does not say, passing on to earth the fruits of the mountains,
      but ‘the earth is sated with the fruit of your works’. This is what
      Gregory, in the <i>Morals on Job</i> 26 says in explaining Job 26:8, ‘He
      binds up the waters in his clouds, so that they break not out and fall
      down together’: ‘For the teacher should not preach to the simple as much
      as he knows, because he himself is unable to know how many divine
      mysteries there are.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, the order with respect to the mode of having is touched upon,
      because God has wisdom naturally. Hence his ‘upper rooms’ are what is
      natural to him; Job 12:13: ‘With him is wisdom and strength; he hath
      counsel and understanding.’ But teachers share in wisdom abundantly. Hence
      they are said to be watered from on high. Sirach 24:42: ‘I said I will
      water my garden of plants, and I will water abundantly the fruits of my
      meadow.’ But listeners sufficiently participate in it, and the satiety of
      the earth signifies this; Psalm 16:15: ‘I shall be satisfied by seeing
      you.’
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, with respect to the power of communicating, because God
      communicates wisdom by his own power. Hence by himself he is said to water
      the mountains. But the teachers do not communicate wisdom except as
      ministers. Hence the fruits of the mountains are not attributed to them
      but to the divine works, ‘By the fruit of your works’. 1 Corinthians 3-45:
      ‘What then is Paul’ and later, ‘His minister in whom you believe’.
    </p>
    <p>
      But 2 Corinthians 2:16: ‘...who is worthy of this...’ For God requires
      innocent ministers; Psalm 100:6: ‘He who walks in the perfect way shall
      serve me.’ Understanding; Proverbs 14:35: ‘A wise servant is acceptable to
      the king.’ Fervour; Psalm 103:4: ‘You make the winds your messengers, and
      the blazing fire your ministers.’ Again, obedience; Psalm 102:21: ‘You
      ministers of his who do his will’.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although no one by himself, of himself, is sufficient for such a
      ministry, he can hope to have this sufficiency from God; 2 Corinthians
      3:5: ‘Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything, as from
      ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God.’ He must ask it of God; James
      1:5: ‘But if any of you is wanting in wisdom, let him ask it of God, who
      gives abundantly to all men, and does not reproach; and it will be given
      to him.’
    </p>
    <p>Let us pray that Christ will grant it to us. Amen.</p></a
