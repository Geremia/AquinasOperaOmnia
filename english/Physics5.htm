      638. After discussing motion and the things that accompany motion in
      general, the Philosopher now undertakes to give various divisions of
      motion. And his treatment falls into two parts:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      In the first he divides motion into its species;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In the second he divides motion into quantitative parts in Book VI.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In the first he makes two parts:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he divides motion into its species;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he discusses unity and opposition of motion, at L. 5.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The first is divided into two sections:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      In the first he distinguishes motion <i>per se</i> from
      <i>per accidens</i>;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In the second he divides motion into its species, at L. 2.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The first is divided into two parts:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      In the first he distinguishes <i>per se</i> motion from
      <i>per accidens</i>;
    </p>
    <p
      style="

        margin-left: 1in;
        margin-bottom: 0.125in;
      "
    >
      In the second he shows that <i>per accidens</i> need not be discussed but
      that <i>per se</i> motion must, at 647.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In regard to the first he does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he distinguishes per se from per accidens motion;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he makes a summary at 646.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In the first part he distinguishes <i>per se</i> motion from
      <i>per accidens</i> motion in three ways:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First, on the side of the mobile;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, on the side of the mover, at 640;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, on the side of the termini of motion, at 641.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      639. He says therefore first (465) that whatever changes, i.e., whatever
      is being changed, is described as doing so in three ways. First,
      <i>per accidens</i>, as when we say that a musician is walking, because
      the person who is walking happens to be a musician. Secondly, a thing is
      described as being changed without qualification even though only some
      part of it is changing, i.e., in statements which refer to part of the
      thing in question: thus the body is said to be restored to health, because
      the eye or the chest, which are parts of the body, are restored to health.
      Thirdly, there is the case of a thing that is in motion neither
      accidentally nor in respect of something that belongs to it as a part but
      in virtue of its being directly and <i>per se</i> in motion. And he says
      “directly” to exclude motion of a part, and <i>per se</i> to exclude
      motion that is <i>per accidens</i>. Now this <i>per se</i> mobile is a
      different thing according to the various kinds of motion: for example, it
      may be a thing capable of alteration—in which case it is called
      alterable—or it may be capable of growing—in which case it is called
      augmentable. Again, in the sphere of alteration it is called heal-able, if
      it is moved in respect of health, and heat-able, if it is moved in respect
      of heat.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      640. Then at (466) from the side of the mover he distinguishes
      <i>per se</i> from <i>per accidens</i> motion, And he says that the
      preceding distinctions which were posed from the side of the mobile can be
      found in the mover. For a thing is described in three ways as causing
      motion. First, <i>per accidens</i>, as “the musician is building”.
      Secondly, by reason of a part (when some part of the mover causes motion),
      e.g., the man is said to strike, because his hand strikes. In a third way,
      something is described as acting or moving directly and <i>per se</i>, as
      “the healer heals”.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      641. Then at (467) looking at the terminus of motion, he divides motion
      once more in the same manner.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he lays down some presuppositions;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he gives his division, at 645.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does three things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he declares how many things are required for motion;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, he mutually compares them, at 642;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, he settles a question, at 644.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore (467) that five things are needed for motion, First,
      there must be a first mover, i.e., a source from which the motion
      originates; secondly, a mobile that is being moved; thirdly, a time in
      which the motion occurs. In addition to these three are required the two
      termini; one from which the motion starts and another into which the
      motion tends; for every motion is from something into something.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      642. Then at (468) he compares these five things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he compares the mobile to the two termini;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he compares one terminus with the other, at 643,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore (468) that whatever is being moved directly and
      <i>per se</i> is distinct from the terminus into which the motion tends
      and from the terminus from which the motion begins, as is evident in these
      three things: wood, hot and cold. For in the motion called heating, the
      wood is the mobile subject, whereas the hot which is the terminus into
      which, is something else, as is the cold, which is the terminus from
      which.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Now he says that what is moved directly is distinct from both termini,
      because there is nothing to prevent what is being moved
      <i>per accidens</i> from being either of the termini: for a subject, such
      as wood, is what becomes hot <i>per se</i>; but the privation, which is a
      contrary, namely, cold, is what becomes hot <i>per accidens</i>, as was
      explained in Book I.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      That the mobile is distinct from each terminus he proves on the ground
      that motion is in its subject, for example, in the wood, and not in either
      of the termini, i.e., not in the species “white” or in the species
      “black”. This is clear from the fact that that in which the motion exists
      is what is being moved. But the terminus of motion neither moves nor is
      moved: whether the terminus be a quality, as in alteration, or a place, as
      in local motion, or quantity, as in the motion called growing and
      decreasing. However, the mover moves the subject, which is being moved,
      into the <i>terminus ad quem</i>, Therefore, since motion exists in the
      subject being moved but not in the termini, it is clear that the mobile
      subject is distinct from the termini of the motion,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      643. Then at (469) he compares one terminus with the other. And he says
      that a change gets its name from the <i>terminus ad quem</i> rather than
      from the <i>terminus a quo</i>; for example, a change into non-being has
      the special name “corruption’, while, on the other hand, “generation” is
      the change into being, even though it starts from non-being. Consequently,
      the name “generation” pertains to being and “corruption” to non-being. The
      reason for this is that through change the <i>terminus a quo</i> is taken
      away, but a <i>terminus ad quem</i> is acquired: for which reason, motion
      seems to have a repugnance for the <i>terminus a quo</i> and a kinship to
      the <i>terminus ad quem</i> —that is why it gets its name from the latter.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      644. Then at (470) he settles a doubt, About which he does three things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      First, he mentions two things that are clear from the foregoing: first,
      that we have already pointed out in Book III what motion is; secondly,
      that in the immediately foregoing we have said that qualities and place
      and passible qualities that are the termini of motion are not themselves
      being changed, since there is no motion existing in them, as we have
      already said and as is clear from heat, which is a passible quality, and
      from science, which is a quality.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, at (471) he mentions a matter about which there is doubt, saying
      that someone may wonder whether passible qualities, such as heat and
      coldness and whiteness and blackness might not be types of motion, since
      none of them is a subject of motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, at (472) he mentions a discrepancy that would arise if such a
      view were posited. For since whiteness is a terminus into which a motion
      tends, then if whiteness itself were a motion, it would follow that there
      is motion in the terminus of a motion, which cannot be, as will be proved
      later. And from this he arrives at the truth that it is not whiteness but
      whitening that is motion, But he adds “perhaps” because he has not yet
      proved that a motion cannot end up in a motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      645. Then at (473) from the fact that termini of motion are distinct from
      the mover and from the mobile, he shows that in addition to the divisions
      of motion taken on the side of the mover and of the mobile, there is a
      third, i.e., one taken on the side of the terminus. And since it is from
      the <i>terminus ad quem</i> rather than from the
      <i>terminus a quo</i> that motions are named, he develops his division not
      on the side of the latter but of the former. And he says that even on the
      side of the termini it is possible to find in motion (1) a goal that is so
      <i>per accidens</i> or (2) partially, i.e., with reference to a part or to
      something other than itself or (3) directly and not with reference to
      something else.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      And first of all, <i>per accidens</i>: when it is said of what is becoming
      white that it is being changed into something that can be understood or
      recognized by someone—that will be <i>per accidens</i> for it is
      accidental to the color white that it is recognized.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But if it is said of what is becoming white that it is being changed into
      a color—this will be according to a part: for it is said to be changing
      into a color because it is becoming white, which is a part of the genus
      color. Likewise, if I should say of someone who is going to Athens that he
      is going to Europe, for Athens is a part of Europe.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      However, if it is said of what is becoming white that it is being changed
      into the color white, this will be directly and <i>per se</i>.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The Philosopher does not divide motion from the viewpoint of time (which
      was one of the five things required for motion) because time is related to
      motion as an extrinsic measure.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      646. Then at (474) he summarizes what he has said. And he says that it is
      clear how something is in motion <i>per se</i> and how
      <i>per accidens</i> and how in respect of something not its entire self,
      i.e., in respect of a part, and again how what is referred to as directly
      and <i>per se</i> is found both in the mover and in the mobile, For it has
      been said what a direct and <i>per se</i> mover is and also what is being
      moved directly and <i>per se</i>. Finally, we have said that there is no
      motion in the quality which is the terminus of motion; rather motion is in
      what is being moved, i.e., in the actually mobile, which is the same
      thing.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      647. Then at (475) he shows which kind of motion needs to be discussed.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he states his proposition;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he explains something he said, at 648.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first that <i>per accidens</i> change will not be the
      subject of our discussion, whether it be <i>per accidens</i> on the side
      of the mover or of the mobile or of the terminus. The reason for this is
      that <i>per accidens</i> motion is indeterminate: for it is present in all
      things, in all termini, in all times, in all subjects and in all movers,
      and an infinity of things can be <i>per accidens</i> in something. But a
      change that is not <i>per accidens</i> is not found in all things; it is
      found only in situations (1) that involve contraries or the intermediate
      between contraries in respect to motions that affect quantity, quality and
      place, or (2) that involve contradictories, for example, generation and
      corruption, whose termini are being and non-being—and all this is evident
      by induction. Now art concerns itself only with things that are
      determinate, and there is no art to deal with the infinite.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      648. Then at (476) he explains his statement that motion can be in the
      intermediates. And he says that an intermediate may be a starting point of
      change and go to either of two contraries, inasmuch as we can take the
      intermediate as being contrary to both extremes. For the intermediate,
      inasmuch as it is akin to both extremes is in a sense either of them.
      Hence, we speak of the intermediate as in a sense contrary relatively to
      the extremes and of either extreme as a contrary relatively to the
      intermediate; for instance, the central note is low relatively to the
      highest and high relatively to the lowest, and grey is light relatively to
      black and dark relatively to white.

        >The species of change; which one is motion</span
      >
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      649. After distinguishing <i>per se</i> from <i>per accidens</i> motion,
      the Philosopher now divides <i>per se</i> change and motion into its
      species.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Here it should be noted that in Book III when Aristotle defined motion, he
      took it as being common to all species of change. It is in this sense that
      he now uses the word “change”. And he is beginning to use the word
      “motion” in a stricter sense, i.e., for a certain species of change.
      Therefore, this section is divided into two parts:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      In the first he divides change into its various species, of which one is
      motion;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In the second he subdivides motion into its species, at L. 3.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he gives his division of change;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he explains the parts of the division, at 654.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does three things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he states certain things that must be mentioned before dividing
      change;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, from these he concludes to the division of change, 651;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, he answers an objection at 652,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      650. He says therefore first (477) that since every change is from
      something to something—as is clear from the very word “change” which
      denotes something after something else, i.e., something earlier and
      something later—it follows from all this that what changes must change in
      one of four ways. (1) For both termini might be affirmed, in which case
      something is said to be changed from subject to subject; or (2) the
      <i>terminus a quo</i> is affirmed and the <i>terminus ad quem</i> negated,
      in which case something is changed from subject to non-subject; or (3) on
      the other hand, the <i>terminus a quo</i> is negated and the
      <i>terminus ad quem</i> affirmed, in which case something is moved from
      non-subject to subject. Finally (4), both termini might be negated, in
      which case something is said to be changed from non-subject to
      non-subject. (Here the word “subject” is not taken in the sense of that
      which sustains a form; rather, anything that is affirmatively expressed is
      here called a “subject”.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      651. Then at (478) he derives from these premisses his division of change.
      And he says that it necessarily follows from these premisses that there
      are three kinds of change: one is from subject to subject, as when
      something is changed from white to black; another is from subject to
      non-subject, as when something is changed from being to non-being; the
      third is from non-subject to subject, as when something is changed from
      non-being to being,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      652. Then at (479) he precludes a possible objection. For someone might
      object that since he mentioned four ways in which change can take place,
      he should have derived four kinds of change and not merely three. But he
      dismisses this objection by saying that there cannot be any kind of change
      from non-subject to non-subject, because every change takes place between
      opposites and two negations are not opposites. For they are neither
      contrary nor contradictory. A further proof of this is that any pair of
      negatives may chance to be true of one and the same thing at the same
      time; for example, a stone is neither healthy nor sick. Hence, since
      <i>per se</i> change occurs only between contraries and contradictories,
      as was pointed out above, it follows that there is no <i>per se</i> change
      from one negation to another. Such changes would always be
      <i>per accidens</i>, for when something changes from white to black, it
      changes at the same time, but <i>per accidens</i>, from non-black to
      non-white. This is the way that something is changed from non-subject to
      non-subject. However, what is <i>per accidens</i> in any genus cannot be a
      species of that genus. Therefore, there can be no species of change from
      non-subject to non-subject.
    </p>

      653. Then at (480) he explains the parts used in his division. About this
      he does three things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he explains the first two parts;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, he shows that neither of them is motion, at 656;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, he concludes that the remaining part is motion, at 659.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does two things,,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he explains one part of the division;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he explains a second part, at 655.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      654. He says therefore first (480) that the change from non-subject to
      subject takes place between contradictories and is called generation,
      which is the change from non-being to being. Now this can take place in
      two ways: one is unqualified generation, by which something comes to be in
      the strict sense of the word; the other is a particular kind of coming to
      be, i.e., in a qualified way, And he gives an example of both kinds. First
      of all, of the second kind, saying that when some thing is changed from
      non-white to white, it is not an unqualified coming to be of the whole
      thing, but a mere coming to be of its whiteness. Then he gives an example
      of the first: and he says that generation from non-being to being in the
      order of substance is generation in an unqualified way, in regard to which
      we say that a thing comes to be without qualification. And since
      generation is a change from non-being to being, a thing is said to be
      generated when it is changed from non-being to being.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      However, when something passes from non-white to white, it is not being
      changed from absolute non-being to absolute being. For, speaking strictly,
      what is being changed is the subject, and the subject of white is an
      actually existing being. Hence, since the subject remains throughout the
      whole change, there already was an actually existing being at the
      beginning of the change, although it was not a being actually existing as
      white. Consequently, it was not a case of unqualified coming to be but a
      coming to be white. But the subject of substantial form is not an actual
      being but a merely potential one, namely, prime matter, which at the
      beginning of generation is under privation and at the end under forms And
      so, in the case of a substance being generated, it is said that something
      comes to be in an unqualified sense.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      From this it can be concluded that when it is a case of the coming to be
      of a form that presupposes another form remaining in the matter, it is not
      unqualified generation but generation in a particular way; because each
      form makes a being actual.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      655. Then at (481) he makes clear the other part of the division and
      states that that change which is from subject to non-subject is called
      “corruption”. But there is a corruption which is so absolutely speaking
      and which, namely, is from substantial being to non-being; while there is
      a certain corruption which is into the opposite negation of any
      affirmation, as from white to non-white, which is the corruption “of
      this”, as has already been said of generation.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      656. Then at (482) he shows that neither of these cases is motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First that generation is not motion;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, that corruption is not motion, at 658.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He proves the first by two arguments. In the first of which he says: What
      is not unqualifiedly a “this something” cannot be moved, because what does
      not exist is not moved; but what is unqualifiedly generated is not a “this
      something” for it is strictly speaking a non-being. Therefore, what is
      unqualifiedly generated is not being moved. Hence, unqualified generation
      is not motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In explanation of the first premiss he says that non-being is spoken of in
      three senses: in the first two senses, non-being is not subject to motion,
      but in the third it is subject to <i>per accidens</i> motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In one sense, being and non-being refer to the affirmation and negation of
      a predicate in a proposition, where they refer to truth and falsity; in
      which sense being and non-being exist only in the mind, as is said in VI
      <i>Metaphysics</i>. Hence, they are not subject to motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In another sense, what is in potency is called non-being insofar as being
      in potency is the opposite of unqualified being in act. Taken in this
      sense no motion is possible,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In a third sense, that is called “non-being” which is in potency, in such
      a way as to exclude not unqualified actual existence, but actually being
      such-and-such; for example, when non-white is called nonbeing and
      non-good. Such non-being is subject to motion <i>per accidens</i>,
      inasmuch as such non-being is attached to an actually existing thing
      subject to motion; as when a man is said to be non-white.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Now, why is it that what is not unqualifiedly a “this something” is not
      subject to motion at all, i,e., neither <i>per se</i> nor
      <i>per accidens</i> ? It is because it is impossible for the non-existent
      to be moved, Consequently, it is impossible for generation to be a motion;
      for generation concerns itself with what is not. And although it was said
      in Book I that something comes to be <i>per accidens</i> from non-being
      and <i>per se</i> from a being in potency, yet it is true to say of what
      is absolutely coming to be that, strictly speaking, it is non-being;
      hence, such a thing cannot be moved and, for the same reasons cannot be at
      rest. Hence, generation is neither motion nor rest,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But if anyone insists that generation is motion, he will be forced to
      admit the strange proposition that non-being can be moved and can be at
      rest.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      657. At (483) he gives a second reason: Whatever is moved is in a place;
      but what does not exist is not in a place, otherwise its place could be
      pointed out, Therefore, what does not exist is not moved.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The truth of the first statement is evident from the fact that since local
      motion is the first of all motions, whatever is moved has to be moved in
      respect of place and, consequently, must be in a place. But if you remove
      the previous, you remove whatever depends upon it.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      658. Then at (484) he proves that ceasing-to-be is not a motion, because
      nothing is contrary to a motion but motion and rest, whereas the contrary
      of ceasing-to-be is generation, which is neither motion nor rest, as we
      have shown. Therefore, ceasing-to-be is not a motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      659. Then at (485) he concludes that the remaining member of the
      above-given division is motion: for since motion is a definite kind of
      change, because there is in it something following something (which
      pertains to the very idea of motion), whereas motion is neither generation
      nor ceasing-to-be (which are changes between contradictories), it follows
      of necessity, since there are only three species of change, that motion is
      from subject to subject.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      By two subjects is understood two that are affirmative, whether they be
      contraries or intermediates; because even privation is a kind of contrary
      that is expressed affirmatively, as nude, which is a privation, and as
      white and black, which are contraries.

      660. After dividing change into generation, ceasing-to-be and motion, the
      Philosopher now subdivides motion into its parts. And because it is the
      same science that deals with a thing and with its opposite,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">He first derives the species of motion;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he explains the various senses of immobile, at 683,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 1in">
      First he posits a conditional proposition in the light of which he deduces
      the parts of motion;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he explains this conditional proposition, at 662.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      661. He concludes therefore (487) from the previous lecture that, since
      motion goes from subject to subject, and subjects are involved in certain
      genera of the predicaments, the species of motion must be distinguished
      according to the genera of predicaments, especially since motions derive
      their nature and name from the terminus, as was said above. Therefore, if
      the predicaments are divided into ten genera of things; namely, substance,
      quality, etc. (as is explained in the book of <i>Predicaments</i> and in V
      <i>Metaphysics</i>) and motion is found in three of these genera, there
      must be three species of motion, i.e., in the genus of
      <span style="text-decoration: underline">quantity</span> and in the genus
      of <span style="text-decoration: underline">quality</span> and in the
      genus of <span style="text-decoration: underline">where</span>, which is
      motion in respect of place.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The way in which motion is present in these three genera as well as how it
      is related to the predicaments of action and passion has been explained in
      Book III. Hence it is enough to mention briefly that a motion is in the
      same genus as its terminus, not that the motion itself would be in the
      genus, for example of quality, but it is placed there by reduction. For
      just as potency is reduced to the same genus as its act, inasmuch as every
      genus is divided by potency and act; so it is necessary for motion, which
      is an imperfect act, to be reduced to the genus of its perfect act. But
      when motion is regarded as being in something, though originating from
      something else, or as originating from one thing and being in something
      else, then it belongs to the predicaments of action and passion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      662. Then at (487) he explains the conditional proposition.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First, that there is no motion in any but the three genera mentioned;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, how motion is present in those three genera, at 678.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does three things.,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he shows that motion is not in the genus of substance,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, that it is not in the genus of relation, at 666;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, that it is not in the genera of action and passion, 668.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He passes over the three predicaments of <i>when</i>, <i>situs</i> and
      <i>habitus</i>. For <i>when</i> expresses existence in time, which is the
      measure of motion, Hence for the same reason that there is no motion in
      action and passion which pertain to motion, there is no motion in
      <i>when</i>. <i>Situs</i> denotes order of parts, and order is a relation;
      in like manner, <i>habitus</i> bespeaks a relationship existing between a
      body and what is adjacent to it. Hence there can be no motion in
      <i>situs</i> and <i>habitus</i> any more than in relation.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      That motion (487) is not found in the genus of <i>substance</i> he proves
      by saying that every motion is between contraries, as we have said; but
      nothing is contrary to substance. Therefore, there is no motion in re8pect
      of substance.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      663. Now, there seems to be a disagreement between this doctrine of the
      Philosopher and what he says in the book <i>On Generation</i>, that fire
      is contrary to water. And again in the book <i>On the Heavens</i> he says
      that the heaven is capable neither of coming to be nor ceasing to be,
      because it does not have a contrary—which seems to imply that things which
      cease to be are either contrary or composed of contraries.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      To reconcile this, some assert that one substance can be contrary to
      another, as fire to water, in respect to form but not in respect to their
      subject. But if that were so, Aristotle’s proof at the end of 662 would be
      worthless; for then there would be motion in substance as long as the
      substantial forms were contrary. For motion is from form to form, because
      even in alteration subject is not contrary to subject, but form to form.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Consequently, another explanation must be given; namely, that fire is
      contrary to water in respect of their active and passive qualities, which
      are hot and cold, wet and dry, but not in respect of their substantial
      forms. For it cannot be said that heat is the substantial form of fire,
      since in other bodies it is an accident in the genus of quality. And
      substance cannot be an accident of something.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But even this answer presents a difficulty. For it is clear that
      properties originate from the principles of the subject, i.e., from matter
      and form. Now, if the properties of fire and water are contrary, then
      since the causes of contraries are themselves contrary, it seems that the
      substantial forms are contrary. Moreover, it is proved in X
      <i>Metaphysics</i> that every genus is divided by differences that are
      contrary, and differences are traced to the forms, as VIII
      <i>Metaphysics</i> explains. Therefore, it seems that there is contrariety
      between substantial forms.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      664. Consequently, it must be asserted that contrariety of differences are
      all the genera is based on the common root of contrariety, which is
      excellence and defect, to which set of contraries all others are reduced,
      as was explained in Book I. For all differences that divide a genus are so
      related that one is like abundance and the other is like defect in
      relation to the first. For which reason Aristotle says in VIII
      <i>Metaphysics</i> that the definitions of things are like numbers in
      which the addition or subtraction of unity makes a different number.
      However, it is not necessary that there be in every genus the same
      detailed contrariety between species as exists in some genera; for a
      contrariety of excellence and deficiency is enough. For since contraries
      are things most distant, then in order to have contrariety in a genus
      there must be found two extremes that are most distant, so that between
      them fall all the things in that genus.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Yet that is not enough for positing motion in a genus, unless it is
      possible to pass without a break from one extreme to the other. Now these
      two conditions are lacking in some genera; for example, in numbers. For
      although all numbers differ according to excellence or defect, yet there
      cannot be found in that genus two extremes that are most distant; for it
      is possible to find a lowest number, i.e., 2, but not a greatest. In like
      manner, there are breaks between the species of number, for each number is
      formally constituted by unity, which is indivisible and not continuous
      with another unity.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Likewise, in the genus of substance. For the forms of diverse species
      differ in respect to excellence and defect, inasmuch as one form is more
      noble than another, for which reason diverse qualities can be caused by
      diverse forms, as the objection mentions.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Yet one form of a species is not contrary to another, if you consider it
      in regard to its own specific nature. First of all, because when you are
      speaking of substantial forms, there is no maximum distance between any
      two forms, such that you must pass through an orderly array of
      intermediate forms to go from the one extreme to the other. Rather, matter
      when it doffs one form can indiscriminately receive any other form in just
      any order. For which reason Aristotle says in II <i>On Generation</i> that
      when fire comes to be from earth, it is not necessary that the
      intermediate elements be involved at all.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, because, since the substantial essence of anything consists in
      an indivisible, no continuity can be found in substantial forms so as to
      make a continuous motion from one form to another by one form growing weak
      and the other growing strong.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Hence the proof by which Aristotle shows that there is no motion in
      substance because contrariety is absent is a demonstration and not merely
      a probability, as the Commentator seems to suggest, However, besides the
      reason given above, there is another which proves that in substance there
      is no motion, and it is this: that the subject of substantial form is
      merely a being in potency.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      665. In qualities of the third species, the two above-mentioned
      characteristics of contraries (namely, continuity and maximum distance
      between the extremes) are clearly manifest: first, because qualities can
      be weakened and strengthened so as to make for a continuous motion from
      quality to quality, and, secondly, because there exists a maximum distance
      between two definite extremes of one genus, as black and white in the
      genus of color, and sweet and bitter in the genus of taste.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      However, in quantity and place one of these two characteristics is
      evident; namely, continuity, but the other, which is max mum distance
      between definite extremes is not found in them, if you seize upon the
      general notion of quantity and place. But it is found, if you look for it
      in a definite thing. For example, in a definite species of animal or plant
      there is a minimum quantity at which the motion of growing begins and a
      maximum at which it is terminated. Likewise, in place there are involved
      two termini that are most distant in respect to some particular motion:
      from one of them motion begins and at the other it is terminated, and this
      happens whether the motion be natural or compulsory.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      666. Then at (488) he shows that there is no motion in the genus
      <i>to something</i>, i,e., relation. For in any genus in which
      <i>per se</i> motion exists, nothing can newly arise in that genus without
      its being changed, just as new color is never found in a colored object
      without that object’s being changed. But it does happen that something can
      be newly said truly of one thing relative to another, where the latter is
      changed but the former not. Therefore, in relation motion is not found
      <i>per se</i> but only <i>per accidens</i>, inasmuch as a new relation
      follows upon some change; for example, equality or inequality accompany a
      quantitative change and resemblance or dissimilarity qualitative change.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      667. What has just been said seems to offer difficulty in respect of some
      types of relation and not of others. For there are some relations that do
      posit no reality at all in the thing of which they are predicated. This
      happens sometimes on the side of both extremes, as when it is said that
      the same thing is the same to the same: for this relation of identity
      would be multiplied ad infinitum, if each thing were the same as itself
      through an added relation, since it is evident that each thing is the same
      as itself. Consequently, this relation exists only in the reasoning power,
      inasmuch as the reason takes one and the same thing as the two extremes of
      the relation. The same thing is true in many other relations.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But there are some relations in which one relation is really in one of the
      extremes but only according to reason in the other; for example, knowledge
      and the knowable. For “knowable” is a relative term, which is applied to
      an object not because it is related to something else by reason of a
      relationship existing in the object but because that something else is
      related to it, as is clear in V <i>Metaphysics</i>. In like manner, when a
      pillar is said to be on the right of an animal: for right and left are
      real relations in the animal (because animals possess definite energies on
      which these relations are based), but in the pillar they are not present
      in reality but only according to reason, for the pillar lacks the energies
      which are the basis of these relations.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Again, there are relationships in which both extremes possess a real
      relation; for example, in equality and resemblance, for both extremes
      possess the quantity or the quality, which serve as the root of the
      relationship. The same is apparent in many other relationships.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Now in those relations which put something real in only one of the
      extremes it is not hard to see that if the extreme in which the relation
      really exists undergoes a change, something new will be said correlatively
      of the other extreme, even though it remains unchanged, since nothing
      really happened to it. However, in those cases in which the relation is
      really found in both extremes, it is hard to see how something relative
      can be said of A if B changes but A does not, for nothing can be newly
      acquired by A without A being changed.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Hence it must be said that if some change in X makes him equal to me (even
      though I do not change at all), that equality was in a sense in me in
      advance as in its root, from which that equality has real existence: for
      since I have such and such a quantity, it belongs to me to be equal to
      anything having the same quantity. Hence, when X newly acquires that
      quantity, that common basis of equality reaches to him: that is why
      nothing new happens to me, when I begin to be equal to X, as he changes.

    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      668. Then at (489) he proves that motion is not in the genera of action
      and passion. For action and passion do not differ really from motion, but
      they add to it something of reason, as we said in Book III. Hence, it is
      the same thing to say that motion is present in acting and being acted
      upon as to say that motion is present in motion, Therefore in regard to
      this he does 3 things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he proposes what he intends;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, he proves his proposition, at 669;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, he posits a distinction that will explain the proposition, at
      677.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Accordingly, he says at (489) that just as motion is not found in
      something relative, so also there is no motion of an agent or a patient
      and, strictly speaking, not even of the mover and moved: for there cannot
      be motion of motion or a coming-to-be of coming-to-be, which are types of
      change, nor even a change of change (which is the genus) or a
      ceasing-to-be of a ceasing-to-be.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      669. Then at (490) he proves that there cannot be change of changes. And
      he does this with six arguments.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The first of which is that there are two ways of interpreting
      <span style="text-decoration: underline">change of change</span>. In one
      sense it means that there is a change of a change, i.e., of the subject
      which is being changed, as there is change of a man, because the man is
      being changed, for example, from white to black. In this interpretation
      there would be a motion or change of a change or motion as of a subject,
      in such a way that the motion or charge are changed; for example, that the
      change gets hot or cold or changes place or grows or decreases. This,
      however, is impossible, because change is not listed among the subjects of
      change, for it is not a substance existing by itself. So there cannot be
      change of change in this sense.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      670. In another way it can be interpreted that there be change of change
      as of a terminus, so that subject A is moved from one type of change to
      another; for example, from getting hot to getting cold or healthy, so that
      two changes are understood to be the termini of one change, as sickness
      and health are taken as the two termini of a change when a man is changed
      from health to sickness. But it is not possible for a subject to be moved
      <i>per se</i> from one change to another but only <i>per accidens</i>. And
      that it is impossible <i>per se</i>, he proves in two ways: for every
      motion is a change from one definite form to another definite form. Even
      generation and ceasing-to-be, which are co-divided with motion, have their
      definite termini; but there is this difference, namely, that generation
      and ceasing-to-be are to opposite termini “thus”, i.e., according to
      contradiction, whereas motion tends to an opposite terminus “not in a like
      way” but according to contrariety.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Therefore, if a subject should be passing from one change to another, for
      example, from getting sick to getting white, while it is at the same time
      changing from health to sickness, it will be passing from one change into
      another change. For while the subject is still partially in the
      <i>terminus a quo</i> it is being moved to the
      <i>terminus ad quem,</i> just as while it still health it is being moved
      to sickness.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Now, if the very motion from health to sickness is the terminus a quo of
      some motion, then while that change (from health to sickness)is still
      going on, the subject is at the same time passing from this change into
      another change, which succeeds in the subject to the first change. But it
      is evident that when the first change shall have ended, i.e., when someone
      has now already changed from health to sickness, subsequently some other
      change could succeed it, And this is not strange: for after the first
      change is over, the subject might remain at rest or it might be affected
      by another change, Therefore, if there is a passing from the first to the
      second change, it will follow that the motion goes from the first change
      to an indeterminate goal. And this is against the true nature of
      <i>per se</i> motion, because every motion is from a definite terminus to
      a determinate goal, for a body does not change <i>per se</i> from white to
      just anything but to black or to something intermediate. It is evident,
      therefore, that two changes cannot be the <i>per se</i> termini of a
      change.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      671. He proves this same point again with another argument: If the passing
      from a previous changing to a subsequent change were motion <i>per se</i>,
      it would not be necessary that the passing be always to a “contingent”
      change, i.e., one which could co-exist with the previous change: as
      becoming white can co-exist with becoming sick, but getting well cannot
      co-exist with getting sick, because these are contrary changes. But it is
      possible that just as becoming white can follow becoming sick in the same
      subject, so also could becoming well. And this is what he says: that the
      passing from one change to another will not always be to a contingent
      change, since it is sometimes to a non-contingent, and that non-contingent
      change proceeds from something to something else, that is, it is between
      two other termini, Hence that non-contingent change into which something
      passes from the change called “getting sick” will be “getting well”, which
      is the opposite of “getting sick”.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Now that this is strange is evident from what we have said above, that
      while the first change is still going on, it is being changed to the
      second change: therefore, while something is being moved to sickness, it
      will be changing to another change called “getting well”. Hat the goal of
      getting well is health (for it is from something to something, as was
      said). Hence it remains that while something is being moved to sickness it
      is at the same time being moved to health, which means it is being moved
      toward two contraries at the same time and intends them at the same
      time—which is impossible. Consequently, it is clear that no change from
      one change to another is <i>per se</i>.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      However, that such a thing can take place <i>per accidens</i>, as he had
      said before, he makes clear, when he says that this can happen
      <i>per accidens</i>, as when a subject is now affected by one change and
      later by another; for example, if someone is changed
      <i>per accidens</i> from remembering to forgetting or to any other change:
      because the subject of the change is sometimes changed to knowledge and
      sometimes to something else, for example, to health.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      672. Before giving the second of the six reasons he promised, he presents
      (491) two conditional propositions: the first of which is that if there is
      change of change and generation of generation, in either case it would be
      necessary to go on <i>ad infinitum</i>; because, for the same reason the
      second generation will have another generation, and so on ad infinitum.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The second conditional is that if generations and changes are so arranged
      that there is change of change and generation of generation, then, if
      there is a last change or generation, there necessarily had to be a first.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      This second conditional he now proves: Let fire be the thing that is
      unqualifiedly generated; if, then, there is a generation of generation, it
      is necessary to say that that unqualified generation was itself generated
      and that its coming-to-be came to be. When, however, that coming-to-be was
      being generated, the fire was not existing (for it is being assumed that
      the fire is being unqualifiedly generated): because a thing does not exist
      while it is coming to be, but it exists for the first time after it has
      come to be. Therefore, as long as the coming-to-be of fire was in the
      state of coming to be, the fire had not yet come to be; therefore, it was
      not yet existing. And again the very coming-to-be of its coming-to-be was
      itself (for the same reason) coming to be. Consequently, just as when the
      coming-to-be of the fire was coming to be, the fire did not exist, so also
      as long as the coming-to-be of the coming-to-be was taking place, the
      coming-to-be of the fire was not existing.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      From this it is clear that coming-to-be of fire cannot exist till that
      coming-to-be is completed and, for the same reason, the previous
      coming-to-be of the coming-to-be of the fire and so on to the first.
      Consequently, if there was no first coming-to-be, there will be no last,
      i.e., no coming-to-be of the fire. But if an infinite process be posited
      in cases of coming-to-be, there will be no first change and no first
      coming-to-be, because in the realm of the infinite there is no first.
      Hence, it follows that there is no sequence at all among generations and
      among changes. But if there is no generation or change, nothing comes to
      be and nothing changes. Consequently, if there were coming-to-be of
      coming-to-be or change of change, nothing ever comes to be or changes.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Note, however, that this argument does not exclude the possibility of one
      change following another ad infinitum. <i>per accidens</i>: which has to
      be admitted according to the opinion of Aristotle, who posited eternal
      motion. But the argument intends to show that there is no
      <i>per se</i> change <i>ad infinitum</i>, for in that case a present
      change would depend on an infinitude of preceding changes and would never
      end.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      673. He gives the third reason at (492) and it is this. One and the same
      motion has as its contraries both motion and rest; for example, both
      descending and rest in the lower place are contrary to ascending. In the
      same way are generation and ceasing-to-be contrary. But contraries are apt
      to affect the same thing. Therefore, whatever comes to be can cease to be.
      But if there is coming-to-be of coming-to-be, then coming-to-be must come
      to be. Therefore coming-to-be ceases to be. But what ceases to be must be:
      for just as it is what is not that comes to be, so it is what is that
      ceases to be. Therefore, it is necessary that when what comes to be comes
      to be, i.e., when something-comes to be and the coming-to-be exists, then
      the very coming-to-be ceases to be, not indeed as soon as the coming-to-be
      is finished or some time after it is finished, but during the coming to
      be-which seems absurd.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But it should be observed that coming-to-be is as a terminus of what comes
      to be as a substance does, because coming-to-be is a change tending to
      substance. But the subject of coming-to-be is not what comes to be but its
      matter. Hence Aristotle is not departing from his proposition that there
      is no change of change, as of a terminus.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      674. At (493) he gives the fourth reason, In every coming to be there must
      be matter from which that which comes to be is generated, just as every
      change requires some matter or subject: for example, in alteration the
      subject is the body, if you are dealing with bodily qualities, or the
      soul, if you are dealing with soul qualities. If, therefore, coming-to-be
      comes to be, there must be some matter involved which passes into the form
      coming to be as the matter of generated fire passed into the form fire.
      However, such matter is not discoverable.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In the same vein he makes use of another medium: namely, that in every
      coming-to-be or change there must be involved a goal toward which
      something is moved. And this goal must be something definite and capable
      of being pointed out. But neither change nor coming-to-be is such a goal.
      Therefore, it is not possible that there be either change of change or
      coming to be of coming-to-be.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      675. At (494) he gives the fifth reason: Genus is to genus as species is
      to species. If, therefore, there is coming to be of coming-to-be, then the
      coming to be of teaching is itself teaching. But this is evidently false:
      for teaching is the generation of science and not of teaching. Therefore,
      neither can there be a coming to be of coming-to-be.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      676. The sixth reason is given at (495) and it is this: If there is change
      of change, whether as of a subject or as of a terminus, then, since there
      are three species of motion, as was said above (motion to where and
      quantity and quality), it will follow that one of these species could be
      the subject and terminus of some other species or even of its own species.
      Therefore, it will follow that local motion can be altered or even be
      moved locally. Such a thing is more plainly absurd when you get down to
      cases than when you speak in general. Therefore, it cannot be admitted
      that there is change of change or coming to be of coming-to-be.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      677. Then at (496) he shows in what sense there can be change of change.
      And he says that since there are three ways in which something can be
      moved, (namely, in respect to an accident or in respect to a part or
      <i>per se</i>, it is only <i>per accidens</i> that there could be change
      of change, i.e., only inasmuch as the subject of the change changes: for
      example, if someone, while he is becoming healthy, would run or learn; for
      then the healing process would be running or learning <i>per accidens</i>,
      just as a musician builds <i>per accidens</i>. But it is not our intention
      to treat of <i>per accidens</i> motion, for we have already decided to
      pass it by.

      678. Having shown that there is no motion in substance or in relation or
      in action and passion, the Philosopher now tells in which genera motion
      does exist. And about this he does three things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he arrives at the intended conclusion;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, he shows how motion is found in each of three genera, 679;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, he answers a difficulty, at 682.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first at (497) that since motion is neither in substance
      nor in relation nor in acting and being-acted-upon, as has been explained,
      there remain but three genera in which there is motion: <i>quantity</i>,
      <i>quality</i> and <i>where</i>, for in each of these genera there is apt
      to be the contrariety which motion requires.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He has already explained both why he omits the three genera of
      <i>when</i>, <i>situs</i> and <i>habitus</i> and how there is contrariety
      in the three genera in which motion is found.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      679. Then at (498) he explains how motion is found in the three genera:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">First in quality;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, in quantity, at 680;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, in where, at 681.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first that motion in the genus of quality is called
      “alteration”. And he refers to this genus a common name—alteration; for in
      Latin the word <i>alterum</i> (other) is customarily applied to things
      that differ in respect of quality. And we are speaking of quality not in
      the sense in which it is found in the genus of substance, where the
      substantial difference is said to be predicated in regard to that which
      qualifies, but in the sense of a passive characteristic (contained in the
      third species of quality) in virtue of which something is said to receive
      or not receive a quality such as hot and cold, black and white, and so on.
      It is in respect to these that things are said to be “altered”, as will be
      shown in Book VII.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      680. Then at (499) he shows how there is motion in quantity, And he says
      that motion in respect to quantity does not have a name for its genus, as
      quality has the generic name “alteration”. Rather it is named according to
      its species, which are “growth” and “decrease”. For the movement from
      imperfect size to perfect is called “growth”; the one from perfect size to
      imperfect is called “decrease”.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      681. Then at (500) he explains how there is motion in where. And he says
      that motion in respect of place has neither a common name for its genus
      nor a particular name for its species, yet he gives it the general name
      <i>latio</i> —although this is not the generic name of every type of local
      motion. For it is properly used of things which are so moved in respect of
      place that it is not due to their own power that their local motion stops;
      in other words, things that are moved not by themselves but by others.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The reason why the common name could be applied to motion in quality is
      that qualities are contrary in the very notion of their species according
      to which they are contained under the genus of quality. But quantities are
      contrary, not according to the very characteristics of their species, but
      according to “perfect” and “diminished”; and it is according to these that
      the species of quantity derive their name. However, in place the only
      contrariety that exists is founded on motion in respect to which two
      termini are most distant, Consequently, because such contrariety is based
      on something entirely foreign to place, no motion in this genus could
      possess a name based either on the genus, or the species under the genus.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      682. Then at (501) he clears up a point about which there could be doubt
      and shows to which species of motion should be reduced a change from
      lesser to greater or greater to lesser; for example, when something white
      becomes less white or more white. For at first sight it might seem that it
      should be reduced to the motions called “increase” and “decrease”. But he
      shows that it should be reduced to alteration, saying that any change
      within the same species of quality, for example, change to whiteness or to
      more or less whiteness, is alteration.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He proves this by the fact that alteration, which is change from one
      contrary to the other in respect of quality, can occur in two ways: first,
      unqualifiedly, as when something changes from white to black or vice
      versa; or secondly, qualifiedly, when something changes from more white to
      less white, and vice versa. And that such a change is a change from
      contrary to contrary he now proves: for when something is changed from
      more white to less white, such a thing is said to be changed from one
      contrary to its opposite, because it is approaching the true contrary,
      which is black. And when it is changed from less white to more white, it
      is as though it were changed from one contrary to its opposite, namely,
      from black to white. For it becomes more white by becoming further removed
      from black and acquiring more perfect possession of whiteness.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In order for there to be alteration, it makes no difference whether the
      change is unqualifiedly from contrary to contrary, or from more to less or
      less to more, except that in the former case the termini of the alteration
      must be two actual contraries; whereas the change in regard to more and
      less involves the subject’s having or not having in a greater or lesser
      degree one or another of the contraries.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      At the end of (502) he concludes that it is now clear that there are only
      these three kinds of motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      683. Then at (503) he explains the various senses of “immobile”, giving
      three. The term “immobile” is applied in the first place to what is
      absolutely incapable of being moved, as God; just as we correspondingly
      apply the word “invisible” to sound’, In a second sense, it is applied to
      what is moved with difficulty (in two ways) either because, after it has
      begun to be moved, it continues slowly and with great difficulty (as when
      we call a lame person “immobile”) or because it is difficult to get it
      started both on account of the labor and time involved, as when we say
      that a mountain or a large rook is immobile, In a third sense something is
      called “immobile”, when it is capable of being easily moved, but it is not
      in motion when and where and in the manner in which it is capable. This
      alone is called “rest”, because rest is the contrary of motion. Here
      “contrary” is used in a wide sense, i.e., in the sense that includes even
      privation. Hence he concludes that rest is privation of motion in that
      which is capable of motion. For “contrary” and “privation” are applied
      only to things that are susceptible of opposites.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Finally, at (504) he summarizes and says that it is now clear what motion
      is and what rest is and what are the varieties of change and which of them
      can be called motion.

      684. After dividing change and motion into its species, the Philosopher
      now begins to discuss the senses in which motion is said to be one, and
      the senses in which motions are said to be contrary. About this he does
      two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he establishes a background of preliminary notions that will be of
      use;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he pursues his main objective, at L. 6.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does three things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he states his intention;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, he pursues it, here at 684;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, he makes a summary, at 694.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first that we must now define the terms <i>together</i>,
      <i>extraneous</i> or <i>separate</i>, <i>touching</i> [in contact],
      <i>intermediate</i> [or between], <i>consecutive to</i>.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The reason for positing these definitions now is that they will be used in
      later demonstrations, just as in the beginning of Euclid are posited
      definitions that serve as principles of later demonstrations.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      685. Then at (5o6) he carries out his plan.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he defines the terms he mentioned;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he compares one to the other, at 692.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does three things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he defines those that pertain to <i>contact</i>, i.e.,
      <i>touching</i>;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, those which pertain to <i>consecutiveness</i>, at 686;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, those that pertain to <i>continuum</i>, at 691.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Since “together” occurs in the definition of in contact, the Philosopher
      defines it first (506) and says that those things are said to be together
      in respect of place which are in one first place, where first place refers
      to proper rather than common place. For things are said to be
      <i>together</i> not because they are in one common place but in one proper
      place; otherwise, we should be able to say that all bodies are together,
      since they are all contained under the heavens.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He speaks of such things that are together in respect of place, in
      distinction to those that are said to be together in time—a point we are
      not now discussing, Conversely, whatever things are one in one place, and
      another in another place, are said to exist <i>separate</i> or
      <i>apart</i>.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But in contact is said of things whose termini are together. The termini
      of bodies are surfaces and of surfaces, lines, and of lines, points.
      Therefore, if two lines are in contact as to their termini, the two points
      of the two lines in contact will be contained under one point of the place
      containing them. From this, however, it does not follow that the thing in
      place is greater than the place, for point added to point does not make
      anything larger. And the same holds for the others.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      686. Then at (507) he defines the things that pertain to
      <i>consecutiveness</i>, About this he does three things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he defines <i>between</i>, which is placed in the definition of
      <i>consecutive to</i>;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, he defines <i>consecutive to</i>, at 689;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, he draws a corollary, at 690.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first (507) that the between is what a naturally and
      uninterruptedly changing thing is apt to arrive at before it reaches the
      ultimate terminus of the motion, into which terminus it is being changed;
      for example, if something is changing from A to C through B, then,
      provided it is a continuous motion, it reaches B before C.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In some cases there are a number of “betweens” to be traversed as you pass
      from one extreme to the other, as from black to white there are many
      colors between; but there must be at least three things involved, two of
      which are extremes and one the <i>between</i>. Consequently, the
      <i>between</i> is what must be passed through before arriving at the
      terminus of a change: but the terminus of a change is a contrary; for it
      has already been stated that motion goes from contrary to contrary.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      687. Because the definition of between made mention of continuity of
      motion, he now shows what continuous movement means. Now continuity of
      motion may be viewed from two aspects: first, from the time during which
      the movement occurs and, secondly, from the thing through which the motion
      takes place for example, the magnitude, in local motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      For a motion to be continuous it is required that there be no
      interruptions in time, because even the slightest interruption of the
      motion as to time prevents the motion from being continuous.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But on the side of the magnitude through which the motion passes there can
      be slight variations without prejudice to the continuity of the motion.
      This is clear in crossings over streets, at which stones are placed
      slightly distant from each other, and over which a person passes from one
      side of the street to another without interrupting his motion. This,
      therefore, is what he says: that continuity of motion is present when
      there is no gap or only the slightest in the thing, i.e., when there is no
      interruption in the thing over which the motion passes or, if there is, it
      is very slight. But there cannot be the slightest interruption of time, if
      the motion is to be continuous.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      How there can be a gap in continuous motion he explains by adding that a
      motion will be continuous even if there is a gap in the material, as long
      as there is no time-gap; for example, if in playing the harp one strikes
      the highest note immediately after having sounded the lowest and none of
      the intermediate ones. But this is not a gap in time, but in the material
      in which the motion takes place.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      What has been said about the continuity of motion applies not only to
      local motion but to all the others as well.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      688. But because it is not evident how the terminus of a local motion is a
      contrary, since one place does not seem to be contrary to another, he now
      gives an explanation. And he says that the contrary in respect of place is
      the greatest rectilinear distance, where greatest distance is taken in
      relation to the motion and the mobiles and the movers, for example, for
      the motion of heavy and light things the distance from the center of the
      earth to the extremity of the sky is the greatest distance, while in
      regard to my motion and your motion, the greatest distance is the interval
      between where we start and where we intend to arrive.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      What he means by the phrase “in a straight line” he explains by adding
      “that the shortest line is definitely limited”. To understand this,
      consider that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line,
      for between any two points there is only one straight line. But there are
      any number of curved lines between two points, where by curved lines we
      mean the arcs of major or minor circles, Now since every measure should be
      finite (otherwise there would be no way of knowing the quantity of a
      thing—for that is the purpose of measuring), the greatest distance between
      two objects is not measured by a curved line but by a straight line which
      is finite and determinate.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      689. Then at (508) he defines what is meant by consecutive to and a
      species of it, namely, contiguous. And he says that two things are
      required in order that something be called consecutive to another. One is
      that it be after the first and in a certain order: either according to
      position, as things that are in order in place; or according to species,
      as 2 comes after 11 or in any way in which things can be in order, as
      according to virtue, according to dignity, according to knowledge, and so
      on. The other requirement is that between that which is consecutive and
      that to which it is consecutive there not be anything of the same kind
      intervening; for example, one line is consecutive to another, if there is
      no line between—likewise from one unit to another and one house to
      another. However, this does not forbid something else intervening. For
      example, an animal could be found between two houses.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Why he said “to which it is consecutive” and “that it is after the first”
      he explains by adding that whatever is said to be consecutive is so in
      respect to something else, not as being prior to it but as following it.
      For 1 is not said to be consecutive to 2, or a new moon to a second new
      moon; rather, it is just the opposite.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Then he defines a certain species of consecutive called <i>contiguous</i>.
      And he says that not everything consecutive is also contiguous, but only
      when it is consecutive and in contact, so that there is nothing at all
      between, i.e., nothing of the same genus or of any other genus.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      690. Then at (509) he concludes from the foregoing that since the
      <i>between</i> is that through which something is changed into what is
      final, and since every change is between opposites which are either
      contrary or contradictory, although there is no between in
      contradictories, it follows that it is between contraries that the
      <i>between</i> is found.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Then at (510) he shows what a <i>continuum</i> is and he says that it is a
      species of the contiguous. For when the terminus of two things in contact
      is one and the same, then something is continuous. And the very word
      “continuum” denotes this. For “continuum” is derived from “continere” (to
      hold together): when, therefore, many parts are held together in a unit
      and, as it were, keep themselves together, then there is a continuum. But
      this cannot be while the endings are two but only when they are one.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      From this he further concludes that continuity can occur only in things
      from which a unity through contact is naturally apt to come about. For in
      whatever way a whole is naturally one and continuous in the same way is a
      continuous unity formed from many things, whether by riveting, by glueing
      or by any form of contact that makes one terminus for two parts, or even
      by being born of another, as fruit is born of a tree and forms a sort of
      continuum with it.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      692. Then at (511) he compares three of the foregoing with one another;
      namely, the consecutive to the continuous, and the continuum. About this
      he does three things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he compares consecutiveness to contact;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, contact with continuum, at 693;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, he draws a corollary, at 694.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first (511) that it is clear why among these three,
      <i>consecutiveness</i> is naturally first in the order of nature, for in
      the cases of contact there is always consecutiveness, since there must be
      an order, at least of position, among things that are in contact. Bat not
      all cases of consecutiveness involve contact, for an order can exist among
      things in which there is no contact, as in substances separated from
      matter. Hence, consecutiveness is present in things that are prior in
      definition, for it is found in numbers, in which there is no contact,
      which is present only among continua. Numbers, however, are prior to
      continuous quantities in definition, for they are more simple and more
      abstract.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      693. Then at (512) he compares <i>in contact</i> with continuous and says
      that for the same reason in contact is prior to continuous, because if a
      thing is continuous it must be in contact, but it does not necessarily
      follow that if it is in contact it is continuous,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      And he proves this from the definitions of the two. For it is not
      necessary that the endings of things be one (which is implied in the
      notion of continuum), if they are together (which is implied in the notion
      of contact). But, on the other hand, if the endings are one, they must be
      together, for what is one is together unto itself.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      However, if “together” implies a relationship between distinct things,
      then things that are together are not one: and according to this, continua
      are not in contact. But they are, if we do not speak so precisely. Hence
      he concludes that natural junction, i.e., continuity, in which one part is
      joined to another at one terminus, is last in coming to be, in the sense
      that what is specific comes to be after what is general, as animal comes
      to be before man. And, therefore, I say that natural junction is last,
      because things must mutually touch if their extremities are naturally
      united; however, it is not necessary that all things that touch be
      naturally joined to one another. But in regard to things which cannot
      touch, it is clear that continuity is impossible.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      694. Then at (513) he draws a corollary from the preceding: i.e., if point
      and unit have an independent existence of their own, as some say who
      suppose a separated existence for mathematical objects), it follows that
      unity and point are not the same.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      And this is clear for two reasons: first, because points are present in
      things that are capable of mutual contact and certain things touch at
      points; but in units contact is never found, but only consecutiveness.
      Secondly, because there must be something existing between two points, but
      between two unities there is not necessarily anything
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      between. For it is evident that between the two unities that form 2 and
      the very first unity, which is 1, there is nothing intermediate.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Finally, at (514) he makes a summary and says that we have defined what is
      meant by together and apart, contact, between, consecutiveness, contiguous
      and continuous. Also we have shown in which circumstances each of these
      terms is applicable,

    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      695. After positing some definitions to be used later, the Philosopher now
      proceeds to discuss unity of motion and contrariety of motions.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he treats of the unity and diversity of motion;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, of its contrariety, which is a kind of diversity, L.8,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does three things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he shows how motion is said to be generically one;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, how it is specifically one, at 697;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, how it is numerically one, at 699.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      696. He says therefore (515) that there are a number of ways in which a
      motion is one, just as one itself has many senses: i.e., generically,
      specifically and numerically. A motion is said to be generically one
      according to the different predicaments. For all motions that are assigned
      to one and the same predicament can be called generically one; thus every
      local motion is one generic motion, because each is in the predicament
      where, and differs generically from alteration, which is in the
      predicament quality, as has been said above.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      697. Then at (516) he shows how motions are specifically one.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">First he shows this;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he raises a question, at 698.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first (516) that a motion is called specifically one
      when, besides being a generic one, it also takes place in a species
      incapable of subdivision. For some species can be subdivided into other
      species, as color, which is a species of quality, is capable of
      differences that make for sub-species. Hence motions in regard to color
      can be diverse in species, as whitening and blackening; but all cases of
      whitening are specifically the same (just as all cases of blackening are),
      for there are no sub-species of whitening.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But when it happens that the species is at the same time a genus, then the
      motions found in a subalternate species are qualifiedly one, although,
      strictly speaking, they are not of the same species. Thus science is a
      species of knowledge, as well as a genus of the various types of science.
      Hence all indoctrination, which is a movement toward science, is in some
      sense specifically the same, although, strictly speaking, it is not, for
      the indoctrination by which grammar is taught is absolutely different in
      species from that by which geometry is taught.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Now it should be observed that in the foregoing the Philosopher has based
      the unity and diversity of motion on the genera and species in which
      motion can occur, because motion is in a certain way reduced to the genus
      in which the motion is.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      698. Then at (517) he raises a question about the foregoing: Whether a
      motion is specifically one and the same when the same thing changes
      frequently from the same to the same, e.g., when a point (according to the
      geometers who imagine that a point can be moved) changes again and again
      from this place to that. Now according to the foregoing it seems that the
      answer should be Yes. For if all motions that tend to the same species,
      e.g., whiteness, are specifically the same, a fortiori two motions from
      the same origin to the same terminus should be specifically one. But if
      that were so, then it would follow that a rectilinear motion is
      specifically the same as a circular motion. For it is possible to pass
      from this place to that by means of a circular motion, i.e., by describing
      an arc, and after by going in a straight line. Likewise, it would follow
      that in the motions of animals, walking (which is in a straight line)
      would be specifically the same as whirling, which consists in turning
      oneself in circles.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      However, he answers this difficulty in the light of the foregoing. For it
      has been decided that if that in which the motion takes place is
      specifically different (as in the present instance the circular path is
      specifically different from the straight), the motion itself is also
      different. Consequently, in order that two motions be specifically the
      same, not only must the goal be specifically the same but also that
      through which the motion passes. Now it is clear that a straight line is
      specifically different from the curved. Consequently, a circular and a
      rectilinear motion, as well as walking and whirling, are not specifically
      the same, even though they tend to the same goal, because the paths are
      not specifically the same.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But if the goals are identical and the paths specifically the same, then
      the motions are specifically the same; and much more so, if the goals and
      the path are numerically the same, the same repeated motions will be
      specifically the same.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      699. Then at (518) he posits the third way in which a motion is said to be
      one; namely, numerically. About this he does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he explains when a motion is numerically one;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he raises some question on this point, at 700.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first at (516) that in the first two senses motions are
      not unqualifiedly one, but they are one only in a sense, i.e., in genus
      and species. But in the third sense a motion is unqualifiedly one, i.e.,
      when it is numerically one in its essence.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Which motion is one in this way will be clear, if we distinguish the
      things required for motion: for numerically there are three things on
      which the unity of a motion depends: first, the subject which is being
      moved; secondly, the genus or species of the motion; thirdly, the time in
      which the motion takes place. And he explains each of these individually.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      A subject of motion is required, because in every case of motion there
      must be something that is being moved, as a man or gold or some body.
      Likewise the subject must be affected by some genus or species of motion,
      such as place or a passible quality. Again, the time must be considered,
      because whatever is moved is moved in time.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Now among these three things, the generic or specific unity of the motion
      can depend on the thing in which there is motion; for example, on the
      place or quality. But the time does not account for the generic or
      specific unity of the motion, for there is only one specific time; rather
      it accounts for the continuity of the motion, i.e., that it flows on
      without interruption.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But unity of motion, in the sense of unqualified unity, depends on all
      three. For that in which the motion exists must be one and indivisible in
      the way that a species incapable of further subdivision is said to be one.
      Further, the time during which the motion occurs must be continuous
      without any breaks. Thirdly, the subject in motion must be one.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      However, there are two types of unity of subject which are not sufficient
      to guarantee that the motion is unqualifiedly one. The first type is
      accidental: for example, Coriscus and white are accidentally one, but the
      motion proper to Coriscus in not the same as the motion proper to white.
      For the proper motion of white is to become black and the motion proper to
      Corisicus is to walk; and these are different. The second type is generic
      and specific unity. For in order that a motion be numerically one, it is
      not enough that the subject be one as something common either generically
      or specifically. For it is possible that two men are being healed during
      the same period of time in regard to the same thing; for example, from
      inflammation of the eye, so that the time is one and the species of motion
      is one, and the subject is one in species. Yet these two healings are not
      one numerically but only specifically.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      700. Then at (519) he raises a question. And about this he does three
      things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he mentions what at first glance seems to be a motion numerically
      one;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, he raises a question about this, at 701;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, he gives the true solution, at 702.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first (519) that it is possible for one mobile, e.g.,
      Socrates, to be altered at two different times with respect to the same
      specific disease, for example, if he is twice healed of eye-inflammation.
      This repeated healing will at first sight be numerically one motion, if
      the health acquired is numerically the same in both cases. And this will
      be so, if it is possible for that which ceased to be to come again into
      being as the same numerical thing—which seems impossible. For the health
      acquired after the first alteration was later lost and the same numerical
      health cannot be regained.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But it seems that if the same numerical health were regained, the second
      alteration would be numerically the same motion as the first; whereas if
      the same numerical health is not regained, the motion will not be
      numerically the same but specifically.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      701. Then at (520) he raises another difficulty on this point. It is this:
      if someone continually perseveres in health or any other accident, could
      the health, or any other habit or passion in bodies, be one? It seems not,
      because certain philosophers believe that all subjects that possess
      certain qualities or habits are in continuous motion and flux.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      If, therefore, in the case of a person who remains healthy, there is one
      and the same health at dawn and at noon and in the evening, there seems to
      be no reason why in the case of a person who gets sick and then recovers,
      the health recovered is not numerically the same as the one previously
      possessed.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Aristotle does not settle this question: first, because it is not
      <i>ad rem</i>, since it pertains to metaphysics, whose province is to
      consider the one and the many, the same and the diverse; and, secondly,
      because this difficulty is based on the false assumption that all things
      are in a state of continuous change and flux, as Heraclitus believed—an
      opinion which Aristotle refutes in IV <i>Metaphysics</i>. Moreover, the
      two cases are not the same: for as long as health remains in spite of
      fluctuations in degree, the original health is not interrupted, as it is
      in the case of one who completely loses his health.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      ?02. Then at (521) he determines the truth in regard to the case mentioned
      in 700. For he mentioned there that if it is the same quality that is
      recovered, the second alteration will be numerically the same motion as
      the first; if the same numerical quality is not recovered, then it is not
      numerically the same act.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Having presented a certain difficulty as though giving a reason for what
      was set down above, he adds that the reason for raising the difficulty was
      that at first sight it seemed that the same argument would hold good for
      the unity of quality and of motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But there is a difference: for it does follow that if two motions are the
      same in the manner in which a motion is said to be numerically one, then
      the habit, i.e., the quality, acquired by the motion is one; because
      numerically the same quality is produced by an act numerically one.
      However, if the quality that returns is one, not everyone would agree that
      the act is one; for if the terminus of two motions is numerically one, it
      does not mean that the motions were numerically one. This is evident in
      local motion. For when a person interrupts his walk, the act of walking
      ceases; but when he resumes, the act resumes. Now, if you were to say that
      the whole journey is one act of walking that ceases to be and is then
      revived, then it would follow that one and the same thing can exist and
      cease to exist any number of times—which is impossible. In like manner if
      the same numerical health is again and again recovered, it does not follow
      that the second healing was the same motion as the first, any more than a
      second walk is the same as a first, even though both go toward the same
      numerical goal.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Finally, he concludes that these difficulties lie outside the present
      enquiry and are for that reason to be passed over.

    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      703. After positing that three things are required in order that a motion
      be unqualifiedly one, namely, unity of time, unity of that in which the
      motion takes place and unity of subject, the Philosopher now intends to
      prove this.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Now while there are a number of ways in which things are unqualifiedly
      one, one being the way in which an indivisible is one and another the way
      in which a continuum is one, no motion can be unqualifiedly one in the way
      that an indivisible is one, because no motion is indivisible.
      Consequently, it remains that a motion is one to the extent that it is
      continuous and that, insofar an a motion is concerned, to be continuous is
      to be unqualifiedly one, so that the very continuity of motion suffices
      for its unity. For if it is continuous, it is one. Accordingly, whatever
      is required to make a motion be continuous is also required to make it
      one.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      704. Now, in order that a motion be continuous, three things are required.
      The first of these is oneness in species. For there will not be continuity
      between one motion and another indiscriminately any more than there is
      continuity between just any two continuous things chosen at random in any
      other sphere. There can be continuity only when the extremities of the two
      things are one—this is implied in the very notion of continuity, as was
      explained above. Now, some things have no extremities at all; for example,
      forms and all indivisibles. Therefore, in regard to such things there can
      be no continuity. Other things have extremities which are divisible and
      have quantity. Some such things are equivocal, i.e., not agreeing in name
      and notion. Such things afford no means of forming continuity; indeed, in
      many cases no contact is possible. For how could a line and walking be in
      contact, or how could they possess a common extremity, so as to make
      continuity possible?
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      This shows that continuity is impossible with things that belong to genera
      or species that are diverse.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      However, motions that differ generically or specifically can follow one
      upon the other, as a person immediately after running can start to get a
      fever—running and getting a fever being in diverse genera. And even in the
      same genus, e.g., in local motion, one change of place could follow upon
      another without the motion being continuous, as is evident in the
      spreading of the lamp (the torch-race), when the torch is passed from hand
      to hand. In this case we have diverse non-continuous motions. Or the
      phrase “spreading of the lamp” could refer to the local motion of the
      flame—which is signified by the word “lamp”—which is moved according to
      the local motion of the fuel that feeds the flame—such local motion being
      called spreading.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Therefore the changes mentioned in the preceding paragraph, since they
      differ either generically or specifically, are not continuous, since they
      cannot have one extremity, which is required for a continuum.
      Consequently, motions that differ generically or specifically may be
      consecutive and “had”, i.e., in contact somehow without any time
      interruption, inasmuch as time is continuous and has its continuity in the
      same way that motion has, namely, because there is one extremity (joining
      two parts). Now there is nothing to prevent one motion from being ended
      and another of an entirely different kind from beginning at the same
      instant that two parts of time are being joined. In that case the two
      motions will be contiguous but not continuous. Therefore, according to our
      premises, it follows that in order that a motion be continuous, it is
      necessary that it be one in species: this unity of species being in the
      motion from the thing in which the motion is, insofar as it is incapable
      of division according to species.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      705. In the second place, continuity of motion requires unity of subject,
      for the motions of diverse subjects cannot be continuous, though they can
      be contiguous, as was said about transferring a lamp from hand to hand.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      706. Thirdly, in order that a motion be continuous and one, it must be one
      as regards the time, so that no period of immobility or rest intervene.
      For if there is a time in which it was not moving, then it was at rest
      during that time, and if a state of rest intervenes, the motion is not one
      but many; for motions that are interrupted by rest are not one but many.
      Consequently, if a motion is interrupted by rest, it will be neither one
      nor continuous. But it is interrupted by rest, if there is a time in the
      middle of it, as was shown. Hence for continuity of motion, there must be
      one continuous time.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But mere continuity of time is not enough, because a motion that is not
      specifically one is not continuous, even though time is not interrupted:
      for although it be one in regard to time, it will be other in regard to
      species. In other words, in order that a motion be one and continuous, it
      must be specifically one; but it does not follow that a motion
      specifically one is unqualifiedly one,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thus, it is clear that the three aforementioned things are required in
      order that a motion be unqualifiedly one. And so he concludes that we have
      now explained which motion is unqualifiedly one.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      707. Then at (523) having posited the three principal ways in which a
      motion is one, he mentions two secondary ways, although these pertain more
      to a certain form of unity than to unity itself. The second of these is
      given at 708.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first (523) that whether a motion be one in genus or in
      species or in substance, i.e., numerically one, it is also called one if
      it is perfect, just as in other things, “perfect” and “whole” pertain to
      the notion of unity. For we do not speak of one man or one shoe, unless
      they are whole.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      However, there are times when we speak of something imperfect as being
      one, provided it is continuous. And the reason for this is that unity can
      be regarded from the viewpoint of quantity, in which sense mere continuity
      suffices for the unity of a thing, or from the viewpoint of the
      substantial form, which is the perfection of the whole. Thus, what is
      perfect and whole is said to be one.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      708. Then at (524) he gives the other secondary way; that a motion is
      called one when it is regular, i.e., uniform, just as in other things an
      object is said to be one, if its parts are alike. About this he does three
      things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he posits this mode of unity in the sense that a regular motion is
      one;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, he shows in which motions regularity and irregularity are found,
      at 709;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, he explains the modes of irregularity, at 710.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore that in addition to the above-mentioned rays of being
      one, a motion is called one, if it, is regular, i.e,,, uniform. For an
      irregular or non-uniform motion does not seem to be one, whereas a
      regular, i.e., uniform motion does (as a motion which is entirely straight
      is uniform).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The reason why an irregular motion does not seem to be one is that it can
      be divided into parts which are not alike, whereas indivisibility pertains
      to the notion of unity, because that which is one is undivided. However,
      an irregular motion is one in a sense. But the unity of irregular and
      regular motions seem to differ according to more and less: because a
      regular motion is more perfectly one than an irregular one; just as a body
      whose part’s are alike is more perfectly one than a body of parts that are
      not alike.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      709. Then at (525) he shows in which motions irregularity and regularity
      are found. And he says that they are found in every genus and species of
      motion: for some things can be altered in a regular manner, as when the
      entire alteration is uniform, and some things can be moved along a
      magnitude that is regular and uniform, as things that are in circular
      motion or in rectilinear motion. The same is true of growing and
      decreasing.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      710. Then at (526) he approaches the task of deciding about irregular
      motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he mentions ways of being irregular;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he shows how an irregular motion is one, at 713.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he assigns two ways in which irregularity is present in motions;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he draws certain conclusions from all this, at 712.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first (526) that the variations that make for
      irregularity in motion are caused sometimes from the thing in respect to
      which there is motion, as is evident especially in local motions for it is
      impossible for a motion to be regular and uniform unless it passes over a
      magnitude that is regular, i.e., uniform. Now a magnitude is said to be
      regular or uniform when each part of it follows its neighbor in a uniform
      manner, so that any part could be superimposed upon any other, as is clear
      in the case of arcs or straight lines. But a magnitude is irregular, if
      one part does not uniformly follow another, as is evident in two lines
      that form an angle, of which one part does not fit perfectly over the
      other in the way that one part of a line fits perfectly over another,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Therefore, a circular motion is regular and so is a rectilinear one: but
      reflexed or oblique motions, whose path forms an angle, are not regular
      and do not take place on a uniform magnitude; likewise any motion on a
      magnitude that is not such that any part of it taken at random fits on any
      other taken at random, For if the part (of the motion) that contains the
      angle is superimposed on a part that does not form an angle, they will not
      match,
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      711. The second difference that makes for irregularity is found neither in
      the place nor in the time nor in the goal (for the goal of a motion is not
      merely a place but also quality or quantity) but in the manner of the
      motion, For in some cases the motion is differentiated by swiftness and
      slowness; because a motion that has the same velocity throughout is said
      to be uniform, while one in which one part is swifter than another is said
      to be irregular.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      712. Then at (527) he draws two conclusions from the foregoing. The first
      of which is that swiftness and slowness are neither species of motion nor
      specific differences, because they can be found in all types of motion,
      since they determine regularity and irregularity, which follow upon each
      species of motion, as was said above. And no species or difference is
      common to every species of a genus.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The second corollary is that swiftness and slowness are not the same as
      heaviness and lightness, because each of the latter has its own motion,
      for the motion of earth, which is heavy, is always toward a downward place
      and the motion of fire is always toward an upward. On the other hand,
      swiftness and slowness are common to diverse motions, as was said.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      713. Then at (528) he shows how an irregular motion is one; Secondly, he
      draws a corollary at 714.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first that an irregular motion can be said to be one
      insofar as it is continuous, but it is less perfectly one than a regular
      motion, just as a line having an angle is less perfectly one than a
      straight line. This is especially clear in a reflected motion, which seems
      to be, as it were, two motions.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Now, since an irregular motion is less perfectly one, it appears to share
      in the notion of multitude, for a thing is said to be less, because it has
      an admixture of the contrary, as what is less perfectly white has an
      admixture of black, at least in being closer to black than a perfectly
      white object is.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      714. Then at (529) he concludes from the immediately foregoing the
      conclusion which he had previously proposed; namely, that motions which
      are specifically diverse cannot form a continuity. For every motion that
      is one can be either irregular or regular. But a motion that is composed
      of specifically distinct motions cannot be regular. For how could a
      regular motion be composed of alteration and local motion? For in order
      that a motion be regular its parts must agree. Consequently, the
      conclusion is that diverse motions that are consecutive but not all of the
      same species do not form a motion that Is one and continuous, as was
      stated above and explained by examples.

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      715. After discussing unity and diversity of motions, the Philosopher now
      discusses contrariety of motions, which is a kind of diversity, as is
      evident from Book I of <i>Metaphysics</i>. His treatment is divided into
      two parts:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      In the first he shows how to understand contrariety in motion and in rest;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In the second he raises some questions about such contrariety, at 742.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he settles the problem of contrariety of motion;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, about contrariety of states of rest, at 727.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does three things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 1in">
      First he distinguishes diverse ways according to which contrariety of
      motion might be taken;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, he rejects some of these ways, at 717;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, he assigns the true way in which motions and changes are
      contrary, at 722.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      716. He says therefore first (530) that it is now time to decide how one
      motion is contrary to another, as well as how rest is contrary to motion
      and rest to rest.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But in this treatment we must first distinguish the ways according to
      which the idea of contrariety in motions can be taken universally. And he
      distinguishes five ways. The first of which is that one idea of
      contrariety in motions is based on one motion approaching a definite
      terminus and another departing from the name terminus. And this is what he
      says: “...whether contrary motions are motions respectively from and to
      the same thing, e.g., a motion from health and a motion to health”.
      According to this, generation and ceasing-to-be seem to be contrary,
      because generation is a motion to being, and ceasing-to-be from being.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The second way is that the idea of contrariety of motions is based on
      contrariety of the termini from which the motions begin. And this is what
      he says: “...or motions respectively from contraries, e.g., a motion from
      health and one from sickness”.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The third way is that contrariety of motions is based on the contrariety
      of the goals at which they are terminated. And this is what he says:
      “...or motions respectively to contraries, e.g., a motion to health and a
      motion to sickness”.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The fourth way is to take contrariety of motions according to the
      contrariety existing between the start of one and the goal of the other.
      This is what he says: “...or motions respectively one from a contrary and
      the other to a contrary, e.g., a motion from health and one to sickness”.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The fifth way is based upon contrariety on the part of both termini of
      each motion. This is what he says: “...or motions respectively from a
      contrary to its opposite and from the latter to the former, e.g., a motion
      from health to sickness and a motion from sickness to health”.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Now contrariety among motions is necessarily based either on one of these
      five ways or on more than one, for there is no other possible way of one
      motion being contrary to another.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      717. Then at (531) he rejects two of these five:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 1in">
      First of all the fourth, which based contrariety on the opposition between
      the start of one and the goal of the other;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 1in">
      Secondly, the second, which based contrariety on the opposition between
      the start of one and the start of the other, at 716.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, he concludes how two of the remaining ways are related, at 721.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first (531) that a motion which begins at one contrary
      cannot be called contrary to a motion that tends to the opposite contrary,
      so as to say that a change from health is contrary to a change to
      sickness. For nothing is contrary to itself; but a motion from health is
      one and the same as a motion to sickness, although they differ in thought
      inasmuch as a change from health is not the same idea as a change to
      sickness—for one stresses the starting point and the other the goal of the
      same notion. Consequently, contrariety of motion must not be taken from
      the viewpoint of the contrariety existing between the start of one and the
      end of the other.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      718. Then at (532) he shows that contrariety must not be taken from the
      contrariety existing between the two starting points of two motions: and
      this for three reasons, of which the first is the following. Two motions
      that tend to the same goal are not contrary; but two motions that start
      from contraries can tend to one and the same goal, for a motion can go
      either to a contrary or to what is intermediate between the contraries, as
      will be said later. Thus two motions that start from contraries could
      terminate at the same intermediate. Consequently, motions are not contrary
      just because they start at terms that are contrary.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      719. He gives the second reason at (533), which is this. The idea of
      contrariety in motion must be based on that which more evidently makes the
      motion contrary, but contrariety between goals at which motions end seems
      to be a greater cause of contrariety in motions than is contrariety
      between termini at which motions start. For when I say that motions begin
      at contrary terms, I am stressing the removal of contrariety, but when I
      say that motions are approaching contrary goals, I am stressing the
      receiving of contrariety. Therefore, contrariety of motions is not based
      solely on the termini at which they start.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      720. He gives the third reason at (534) and it is this. Things receive
      contrariety from that from which they take their name and species, for
      contrariety is a difference based on form, as in clear in Book X of
      <i>Metaphysics</i>. But every motion gets its name and species from the
      goal more than from the starting point, as healing is a motion to health
      and getting sick is a motion to sickness. This point was mentioned before.
      Therefore, contrariety of motions is taken rather from the goal than from
      the terminus at which they start. Thus our conclusion is the same as
      before.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      721. Then at (535) he concludes that having rejected the two ways that
      were based on the contrariety of termini, there remain two other ways,
      namely, the third and the fifth. Of these, one is based solely on the
      contrariety of goals and the other on the contrariety of both sets of
      termini. Way #1 was not based on any contrariety of termini but on
      approach and departure from the same terminus. He further concludes that
      perhaps these two remaining ways are really the same, because motions that
      tend to contrary goals also start at contraries; but perhaps they are not
      the same in conception, on account of the various relationships that exist
      between motions and their termini, as was said above. For example, a
      motion to health is really the same as a motion from sickness, but they
      differ in conception. The same is true for a motion from health and a
      motion to sickness.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      722. Then at (536) he explains how to take contrariety in motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First, when the motion tends toward a contrary;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, when it tends toward the intermediate, at 726.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he explains what makes for contrariety in motions;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, in changes, at 724.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he explains his proposition with a syllogism;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, by induction, at 723.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      As to the first, he gives this reason at (536): The contrariety of things
      is based on their specific nature and definition. But the specific
      definition of motion is that it is a change which takes place from a
      definite affirmed subject to a definite affirmed subject and that two
      termini are involved—on this point, motion differs from change, which does
      not always require two affirmed termini. Therefore, we are left with the
      fact that for contrariety of motion there must be contrariety on the side
      of both termini. In other words, a motion which goes from contrary to
      contrary is, strictly speaking, contrary to one that is from contrary to
      contrary; for example, one that is from health to sickness is contrary to
      one from sickness to health.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      723. Then at (537) he proves the same by induction. And first of all in
      bodily alterations: for to fall ill is contrary to getting well. In these
      two examples the first is from health to sickness and the other from
      sickness to health. This is also evident in changes that occur in the
      soul: for to learn is contrary to being led into error (not by oneself but
      by another). These two motions are also from contraries to contraries,
      because learning is a motion from ignorance to knowledge, and being
      deceived is from knowledge to ignorance.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says “not by oneself”, because just as, in the case of knowledge, it is
      possible for a person to acquire it by himself (and this is called
      “discovery) or with someone’s help (and this is called “learning”), so
      also it can happen that a person is led into error sometimes by himself
      and sometimes by another. It is the latter that is properly opposed to
      learning.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Continuing, we take an example from local motion: for an upward motion is
      contrary to a downward (and these are contraries in respect of length); a
      motion to the right is contrary to one to the left (and these are contrary
      in respect of breadth); and a motion to the fore is contrary to one to the
      rear (and these are contrary in respect of depth).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But notice that Aristotle is here speaking of differences of position as
      they apply to man: for up and down are measured in respect to man’s
      length; left and right in respect to his breadth; fore and after in
      respect to his thickness, which is called height or depth.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Moreover, it should be noted that even in natural motions, there is a
      contrariety based on up and down; but in regard to right and left, or fore
      and aft, the contrariety is not according to nature but according to
      motions that originate from the soul, which has motions toward these
      contrary directions.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      724. Then at (538) he shows how there is contrariety in changes.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he explains how to take contrariety of change in things in which
      contrariety is found;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, how to take it in things in which there is no contrariety, at
      725.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first (538) that if contrariety is taken merely from the
      goal so that what tends to a contrary is said to be contrary, such a
      process does not make for contrariety of motion, but of change, which is
      generation and ceasing-to-be, as becoming white and becoming black are
      contrary. Now the contrariety of these instances of generation is not
      based on the contrariety of starting point; because in generation the
      starting point is not something affirmed but something negated, for the
      white comes to be from the non-white and not from something affirmed. For
      a change from subject to subject is not change but motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Then at (539) he shows that in things in which there is no contrariety,
      for example, in substances and the like, contrariety of change is based on
      approach and departure from the same terminus, as accession to the form of
      fire, which pertains to the generation of fire, and receding from the same
      form, which pertains to its ceasing-to-be, are contraries. Hence
      generation is contrary to ceasing-to-be and any loss is contrary to any
      gain, But these are changes, not motions.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      It is evident, therefore, that of the five ways listed above, the second
      and fourth are of no use; one of the remaining is suitable for knowing
      contrariety of motions, and the other two are suitable for contrariety of
      changes.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      726. Then at (540) he decides about contrariety of motion from the
      viewpoint of the intermediate between contraries. And he says that
      wherever a pair of contraries admit of an intermediate, motions to that
      intermediate must be held to be somehow motions to one or other of the
      contraries, for the intermediate serves as a contrary for the purposes of
      motion, no matter in which direction the change may be. For example, grey
      in a motion from grey to white takes the place of black as starting point,
      but in a motion from white to grey, it takes the place of black as goal.
      For the middle is, in a sense, opposed to either of the extremes, as has
      been said above.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Finally, he concludes what he mainly intended; namely, that motions are
      contrary to one another, only when one is a motion from a contrary to the
      opposite contrary and the other is a motion from the latter to the former.

    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      727. After discussing contrariety of motions, the Philosopher now
      determines about contrariety of states of rest.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">First, in motions;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, in changes, at 732.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he shows how rest is contrary to motion;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, which is contrary to which, at 728.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says first (541) that since not only motion but also rest seem to be
      contrary to motion, we have to decide how rest is contrary to motion, for,
      strictly speaking, it is motion that is perfectly contrary to motion.
      However, even rest is opposed to motion, since it is the privation of
      motion, and privation is somehow a contrary. For privation and possession
      form the fundamental contraries, as is said in Book X of
      <i>Metaphysics</i>, since the idea of privation and possession are
      involved in every type of contrary, inasmuch as in any set of contraries,
      one of them is as privation in respect of the other; for example, black in
      relation to white and sweet in relation to bitter.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      728. Then at (542) he shows which rest is contrary to which motion. About
      this he does three things:

    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he phrases the question;

    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, he determines the truth, at 729;

      Thirdly, he proves it, at 731.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      In the question which he proposes (542) he assumes that not any state of
      rest is indiscriminately opposed to just any state of motion, but a
      definite type of rest to a definite type of motion; for example, rest in
      place is opposed to motion in regard to place. But because the question
      here is a general one, there still remains another problem: whether the
      opposite of that rest which consists in possessing its goal, for example,
      whiteness, is the motion to whiteness, i.e., whitening, or the one from
      whiteness, namely, blackening.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      729. Then at (543) he determines the truth.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First as to the contrariety of motion to rest;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, as to the contrariety of rest to rest, at 730.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first (543) that since motion is between two affirmed
      termini, the contrary of a motion from A to its contrary B is rest in A;
      for example, the contrary of a motion from whiteness to blackness is rest
      in whiteness, while the contrary of a motion from the contrary B to A is
      rest in B. For example, the contrary of a motion from black to white is
      rest in black.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      730. Then at (544) he treats of the contrariety of one state of rest to
      another. And he says that those states of rest which are in contrary
      termini are mutually contrary. For it is not suitable to have motions
      contrary to one another and states of rest not contrary. And how states of
      rest in opposites are opposite, he explains with the example that rest in
      health is the opposite of rest in sickness.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      731. Then at (545) he proves what he had said about the contrariety of
      rest to motion. And he says that the opposition of a motion from health to
      sick is rest in health; for it is not reasonable that rest in health be
      the opposite of a motion from sickness to health. This he now proves: Rest
      in the very goal toward which something else is in motion is the
      consummation and perfection rather than the opposite of that motion. And
      that rest in the goal toward which there is motion is its perfection is
      evident from the fact that the state of rest is coming to be during the
      motion, because the very movement toward the goal means that rest is
      coming to be. Hence, since motion is the cause of that rest, it cannot be
      its opposite, because a thing is not the cause of its opposite. Now the
      contrary of a motion must be either rest in its goal or rest in the
      starting point. For it is not reasonable to say that rest in some other
      species is contrary to a given motion or rest, any more than rest in
      whiteness is contrary to rest in health or motion to health. Consequently,
      since rest in the goal is not contrary to motion toward that goal, the
      only thing that remains is that it is contrary to rest in the starting
      point.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      732. Then at (546) he determines about contrariety of rest in changes.
      About this he does three things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he repeats what has already been said about contrariety of changes;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, he shows that the opposite of change is not rest but non-change,
      at 733;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, how non-change is contrary to change, at 736.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He repeats therefore first (546) that in changes that do not involve
      termini that are contrary, for example, in the generation and
      ceasing-to-be of substance, opposition is based on approach and departure
      from the same terminus. For a change from A is opposed to a change to A,
      as a change from existence, i.e., corruption, is opposed to a change to
      existence, i.e., generation. However, neither of these is called motion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      733. Then at (547) he shows that these changes do not have an opposing
      state of rest. About this he does three things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he proposes what he intends;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      Secondly, he interposes a question, at 734;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Thirdly, he proves his proposition, at,133-5.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first (547) that changes which do not pass from contrary
      to contrary have no states of rest opposed to them; rather what is opposed
      to them in the way that rest is opposed to motion can be called
      non-change.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      734. Then at (546) he interposes a question on this matter. For it has
      been said that a change to being is contrary to a change from being, which
      is really a change to non-being. Now the expression “non-being” has two
      senses: In one sense, it implies a subject, which is either an actual
      being, as when non-white is in a body, or a potential being, as when
      privation of substantial form is in first matter. In a second sense,
      non-being can imply that no subject is involved, i.e., that we are dealing
      with absolute non-being.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      If non-being is taken in the first sense, i.e., that a subject. is
      implied, then it would be possible to find out how one non-change is
      contrary to another non-change: for it could be said that a non-change in
      being is opposed to a non-change in non-being. For, since non-being has a
      subject, there is nothing to prevent that subject from persevering in
      non-being, which is the same as not changing.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Rut if there is nothing which is not, i.e., if non-being has no subjects
      then the question remains: to which non-change is the non-change or rest
      in being contrary? For what does not exist at all cannot be said to be at
      rest or to be unchangeably permanent. And since some kind of non-change
      must be contrary to non-change or rest in existence, it follows that that
      non-existence from which generation begins and toward which ceasing-to-be
      tends is a nonbeing that has a subject.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      735. Then at (549) he explains something he had supposed, namely, that the
      opposite of generation and of ceasing-to-be is not rest. For if it were,
      then either of two things would follow: first, that not every rest is
      contrary to motion, or, secondly, that generation and ceasing-to-be are
      motions. So it is clear that whatever it is that is opposed to generation
      and ceasing-to-be, it is not rest, unless generation and ceasing-to-be are
      motion—which they are not, as we have proved above.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      736. Then at (550) he shows how non-change is contrary to change. And he
      says that there is a parallel between the contrariety of non-change to
      change and that of rest to motion: for a non-change An being is contrary,
      either to no non-change (which would be, if non-being has no subject) or
      to that non-change which is in nonbeing (if non-being has a subject). And
      this contrariety is like the opposition between one rest and another.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Or we can say that a non-change in being is the opposite of corruption, as
      rest is of motion. However, it is not the opposite of generation, because
      corruption departs from non-change and rest in being, whereas generation
      tends to it. And we already know that the opposite of motion and change is
      not rest in the goal but rest in the starting point.

    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      737. After discussing the contrariety of motions and of rests, the
      Philosopher now raises some questions concerning these matters, About this
      he does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he raises questions and solves them;
    </p>
    <p
      style="

        margin-left: 1in;
        margin-bottom: 0.125in;
      "
    >
      Secondly, he explains certain matters that may still be doubtful in regard
      to these questions, at 747.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The first part is divided into three sections, one for each question he
      raises. About the first point he does two things;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he raises a question;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he solves it, at 740.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      738. Therefore he first (551) raises the question why it is that in the
      genus of local motion, but not in the other general there are found some
      motions and rests that are according to nature and some not according to
      nature. For example, why in it that there are alterations according to
      nature but none not according to nature? For getting well does not seem to
      be according to nature or not according to nature any more than getting
      sick, since each originates from a natural intrinsic principle. The same
      is true in regard to getting white and getting black or in growing and
      decreasing, for the former motions are not so contrary to one another that
      one is according to nature and the other not, since each is a natural
      process. Nor is growing contrary to growing in such a way that one is
      according to nature and the other not. The same is true of generation and
      ceasing-to-be: for generation cannot be said to be according to nature and
      ceasing-to-be not according to nature, for growing old--which is the road
      to ceasing-to-be-is according to nature. Nor does it appear that one
      generation is according to nature and another not.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      739. Now it seems that what he says here is opposed to a declaration in
      <i>On the Heavens</i>, that old age and every defect and ceasing-to-be are
      against nature. But it must be said that old age and ceasing-to-be and
      decreasing are against nature in one sense and according to nature in
      another. For if we consider the specific nature of anything, i.e., its
      particular nature, it is clear that all ceasing-to-be and all defects and
      decrease are against nature: because each thing’s nature tends to preserve
      the subject in which it exists, whereas the contrary of this happens when
      the nature is weak or defective.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But if we consider nature in general, all these things are the result of a
      natural intrinsic principle, as the destruction of an animal results from
      the contrariety of hot and cold; and the same is true for all the others.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      740. Then at (552) he answers this question by invalidating it. About this
      he does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.5in; margin-left: 1in">
      First he shows that things according to nature and not according to nature
      are found in every genus;
    </p>
    <p
      style="
        text-align: justify;

        margin-left: 1in;
        margin-bottom: 0.125in;
      "
    >
      Secondly, how these two things are contrary when they occur in motions and
      it states of rest, at 742.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      About the first he does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in">
      First he determines the truth;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Secondly, he removes an objection, at 741.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He says therefore first (552) that since what takes place through
      compulsion is contrary to nature (because compulsion arises from a
      principle outside a thing in such a way that the thing suffering
      compulsion does not cooperate, whereas what is natural comes from an
      intrinsic principle) it follows that compulsive ceasing-to-be is contrary
      to natural ceasing-to-be, just as a ceasing-to-be that is outside of
      nature is opposed to one according to nature.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      According to the same argument, he concludes that some generations are
      compulsory and not according to fate, i.e., not according to the order of
      natural causes (because the order of natural causes. can be called
      “fate”), as when a person grows roses or fruits by artificial means out of
      season or when the generation of frogs or other natural things is procured
      artificially. Consequently, since these generations are compulsory, they
      are outside of nature and are contrary to generations according to nature.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He shows the same for growing and decreasing. For some cases of growth are
      compulsory and unnatural, as is evident in persons who reach the state of
      puberty in an abnormally short time, on account of soft living or on
      account of the food, i.e., they are fed abundantly and delicately. The
      same is also apparent in the growing of wheat, for sometimes the grains
      grow unnaturally through abundance of moisture and are not compact, i.e.,
      made thick and solid by normal digestion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Likewise in alterations. Some are compulsory and some natural, as is
      especially evident in the process of getting well. For some recover from
      fever on the critical days and some not on the critical days. The former
      are cured according to nature and the latter not according to nature.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      741. Then at (553) he raises an objection against the foregoing. For since
      what is outside the nature is contrary to what is according to nature,
      then if there are generations that are according to nature and some not,
      and the same for ceasing-to-be, it follows that instances of ceasing-to-be
      are contrary not to generation but to one another, because one thing
      cannot be contrary to two.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But he solves this by saying that there is nothing to prevent generation
      from being contrary to generation, and ceasing-to-be to ceasing-to-be.
      This is true, even if you were to abstract from the contrariety between
      what is according to nature and what is against nature. For if you take
      the case of something sweet coming to be and then ceasing to be, and the
      case of something sad coming to be and ceasing to be, the two cases of
      coming-to-be would be contrary and the two of ceasing-to-be would be
      contrary. (When he speaks of the coming to be and the ceasing to be of the
      “sweet”, he means when “something more noble comes to be from the less
      noble that has ceased to be, as when fire is generated from air; on the
      other hand, the coming to be and ceasing to be of the “sad” refers to the
      less noble coming to be from the ceasing-to-be of the more noble, as when
      air is generated from fire).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Now even though ceasing-to-be is contrary to ceasing-to-be, it does not
      follow that it is not opposed to coming-to-be, for ceasing-to-be is
      opposed to coming-to-be when both are taken generically, while
      ceasing-to-be is opposed to ceasing-to-be in a specific sense. For
      example, avarice is contrary to liberality in the way that a vice is
      contrary to a virtue, but it is opposed to prodigality as one species to
      another. So that what he concludes is this: ceasing-to-be is contrary to
      ceasing-to-be, not in a generic sense, but one ceasing-to-be is this and
      another that, i.e., compulsory and beyond nature, or sweet and sad.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      742. Then at (554) he explains contrariety in motion and rest on the basis
      of their being outside nature and according to nature. And he says that
      not only coming-to-be is contrary to coming-to-bg and to ceasing-to-be
      from the viewpoint of being outside nature and according to nature, but in
      general all motions and rests are contrary in this way. For example, an
      upward motion is contrary to a downward one (because up and down are
      contrarieties of place) and each of these motions is natural to certain
      bodies: for fire is naturally carried upward and earth downward. And again
      in regard to each of these motions, one can take as contrary differences
      that which is according to nature and that which is outside the nature.
      And this is what he means when he says that “these contrarieties in motion
      are differences”, or he might mean that in respect to the very bodies that
      are moved there are contrary differences in their motions, namely,
      according to nature and outside their nature. For an upward motion is
      natural to fire but a downward not. So it is clear that a motion which is
      according to nature is contrary to one that is outside nature.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Likewise for states of rest. For rest which is above is contrary to a
      downward movement. But rest above is not natural to earth, whereas a
      downward motion is. According to the foregoing then, it is clear that rest
      which is outside the nature is contrary to the natural motion of the body
      involved, for even in the same body, motions ate mutually contrary, in the
      sense that the natural motion of one body is contrary to an unnatural
      motion of the same body. The same is true of rest; for some contrary rests
      will be according to nature, as rest above for fire and rest down for
      earth; others are outside the nature? as down for fire and up for earth.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      743. Then at (555) he raises the second question; Has every state of rest
      that is not eternal a becoming, which becoming is called a
      <i>coming to a standstill</i> ? The answer seems to be “no” for two
      reasons. First of all, if there is coming-to-be of every state of rest
      that is not eternal, it will follow that there is coming-to-be for states
      of rest which are outside nature (as when earth is at rest above). Now
      rest can be produced only by a previous motion, and the motion preceding
      an unnatural state of rest is compulsory. Consequently, it follows that
      when earth is violently projected upwards, it is then that rest comes to
      be. But this cannot be, because “the velocity of that which comes to a
      standstill seems always to increase”, i.e., when rest is being generated
      through motion, it is true that as the state of rest gets closer, the
      motion gets swifter. For since the perfection of coming-to-be is the thing
      produced, and since each thing gets stronger and more intense as it gets
      closer to its perfection, it follows that the motion through which rest is
      produced is swifter the more it approaches rest, as is abundantly clear in
      natural motions.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      But in things that are moved by compulsion the contrary happens: for the
      motion grows less intense the closer it gets to the state of rest.
      Consequently, compulsory rest is not generated. This is what he means when
      he says that some things come to rest by compulsion “without having become
      so”, i.e., in such a way that their rest is not generated.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      744. He gives the second reason at (556) and it is this:
      <i>Coming to a standstill</i>, i,e., the coming-to-be of rest, is either
      entirely the same as the natural motion by which something is carried to
      its natural place or it is something that happens to accompany it. Now it
      is clear that both are the same reality though differing in conception.
      For the goal of a natural motion is to be in a natural place, but to be in
      a natural place and to be at rest in it are really the same thing.
      Consequently, a natural motion and the coming-to-be of rest are the same
      thing in reality and differ only in conception. However, it is evident
      that compulsory rest is not brought about by a natural motion. Therefore,
      coming to a standstill is not present in compulsory states of rest, i.e.,
      such states are not generated.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      745. Then at (557) he raises a third question about a point mentioned in
      Lecture 3, that rest in A is contrary to motion from A. Now this seems to
      be false, because when something is moved from A as from a place, or A is
      being abandoned, as in the case of a quality or quantity, while it is
      being moved it still seems to have that which is cast off or left behind.
      For a thing does not leave its entire place all of a sudden but
      successively; likewise, it is only gradually that it loses whiteness.
      Therefore, while it is being moved it still retains something of the
      starting point. If, therefore, the state of rest whereby something remains
      in a starting point is contrary to the motion by which departure is made
      therefrom, it follows that two contraries are together—which is
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      746. So at (558) he solves this difficulty. And he says that what is being
      moved by departing from its starting point is at rest therein not
      absolutely but in a certain sense only, i.e., in the sense that it is
      there not in its entirety but partly, because it is universally true that
      in all cases of motion, part of the mobile is in the
      <i>terminus a quo</i> and part in the <i>terminus ad quem</i>. Nor is it
      unacceptable that one contrary be mixed with another in a certain respect;
      but the less it is mixed, the more perfectly is it contrary. Therefore, a
      motion is more contrary to another motion (since they are never
      intermingled) than a rest is, which somehow intermingles.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Finally, in summary, he says that we have spoken about motion and rest and
      how unity and contrariety are found therein.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      747. Then at (559) he states some things that will clarify the foregoing.
      (These passages are said not to be found in the Greek MSS. and, according
      to the Commentator, not even in the Arabic MSS.; consequently, these
      statements seem to have been lifted from the sayings of Theophrastus or
      some other expositor of Aristotle). Three things are here posited in an
      attempt to clarify the foregoing.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      The first pertains to the question previously raised about the generation
      of unnatural rest. And he says that someone may wonder about “Coming to a
      standstill”, i.e., about the coming-to-be of rest, for if all motions that
      are outside nature have an opposing state of rest, i.e., an unnatural one,
      does that state of rest come to be? If it is held that there is no “coming
      to a standstill” in cases of compulsory rest, something unacceptable
      follows. For it is clear that a thing in compulsory motion will sometimes
      remain, i.e., come to rest, by compulsion. Consequently, it will follow
      that something will be at rest not eternally without having come to
      rest—which seems impossible. But it is plain that sometimes there is
      compulsory rest. For just as things are moved outside their nature, so
      also they rest outside their nature. Rut it should be observed that what
      is said here appears contrary to what was said above (at 743). Hence
      Averroes says that a solution is now being given to a question previously
      raised.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      However, it is better to say that the previous doctrine contains more
      truth, although what is being said here is somehow true also. For
      compulsory rest is not, strictly speaking, generated in the sense that it
      proceeds from a cause that is essentially productive of rest, as happens
      when natural rests are generated. But compulsory rest is generated
      <i>per accidens</i> through lack of a productive force, because when the
      compulsion of the mover either ceases or meets an obstacle, the state of
      compulsory rest comes to be. This is why compulsory motions peter out at
      the end, whereas natural ones become more intense.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      It should be noted also that there is found another text for this place,
      to which we should give our attention. For it reads., Someone may ask
      whether to a motion outside nature there is any contrary rest not
      according to nature? This does not inquire whether, properly speaking, a
      state of rest that is contrary to nature is opposed to a motion that is
      contrary to nature, as Aristotle taught above; rather, here one is now
      speaking in wide and loose terms in the sense of the general opposition
      between rest and motion. And he says that it seems unreasonable not to
      find unnatural states of rest. For it is clear that the violence of the
      mover will cease at some time and unless rest eventuates, the motion will
      not come to a standstill. Hence it is clear that. to compulsory motions
      are opposed compulsory states of rest, because to what is moved outside
      its nature there belongs to rest outside its nature.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      748. Then at (560) he mentions a second fact to explain his doctrine on
      the contrariety of natural and compulsory motion. And he says that since
      certain things are subject to motions that are according to nature and
      outside their nature, as fire is moved upward according to nature and
      downward outside its nature, the question arises whether the natural
      upward motion of fire has for its contrary the compulsory downward motion
      of fire or the natural downward motion of earth.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      He answers that both are contrary to the natural upward motion of fire but
      not in the same way. For the downward motion of earth is contrary to the
      upward motion of fire as something natural contrary to something natural,
      whereas a downward motion of fire is contrary to the upward motion of fire
      as something natural contrary to something compulsory. The same is true
      for the contrariety of states of rest.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      749. Then at (561) he mentions a third point to explain what he previously
      said about contrariety of rest to motion. And he says that perhaps motion
      is not strictly opposed to rest, but only in some sense. For when someone
      is being moved from A, in which he was at rest, and is doffing it, it
      seems to retain something of A. Hence if rest in this place is contrary to
      a motion from this place to a contrary place, it follows that contraries
      are together. But yet a thing is somehow still at rest while it perseveres
      in A; indeed, speaking generally of a thing in motion, part of it is in
      the <i>terminus a quo</i> and part in the <i>terminus ad quem</i>.
      Consequently, rest is less contrary to motion than a contrary motion is,
      as was explained above.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Finally, he sums up, as is clear of itself.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
      Now the fact that the same words that appeared in an earlier passage (see
      end of 246 above) are repeated, lends support to the possibility that they
      are not the words of Aristotle, but of some expositor.
