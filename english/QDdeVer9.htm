    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It seems not, for</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. As Augustine says,’ only God can perfect a mind. But the illumination of
    an angel is, in a way, a perfecting of the mind of the person illumined.
    Hence, only God can illumine an angel.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. There are no lights in angels other than those of nature and of grace.
    Now, one angel does not illumine another by the light of nature, because
    every angel has his natural powers directly from God, nor does one angel
    illumine another by the light of grace, because grace also comes directly
    from God alone. Consequently, one angel cannot illumine another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. As a body is related to material light, so is a spirit related to
    spiritual light. Now, a body illuminated by a very bright light is not
    illuminated simultaneously by a weaker light. For example, air illuminated
    by the light of the sun is not illuminated at the same time by the moon
    Consequently, since God’s spiritual light surpasses any created light more
    than the light of the sun surpasses that of a star or of a candle, it seems
    one angel is not illumined by another, simply because all angels are
    illumined by God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. If one angel illumines another, he does this either through a medium or
    directly. But he cannot do it directly, because then he would have to be
    joined directly to the angel he is to illumine; and only God can be joined
    to minds in this manner. On the other hand, he canno illumine another angel
    through a medium. He cannot illumine by means of a material medium, because
    such a medium cannot receive a spiritual light. Nor can he illumine by means
    of a spiritual medium because this medium would have to be an angel, and
    then an infinite series would arise, and illumination would be utterly
    impossible, for it is impossible to pass through an infinite. And, if we
    finally arrive at a point where one angel directly illumines another, this
    has already been shown to be impossible. Consequently, it is impossible for
    one angel to illumine another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. If one angel illumines another, he does this by giving him eithe his own
    light or some other light. But he does not do it in the first man ner,
    because, in that case, one and the same light would be in two different
    illuminated beings; nor does he do it in the second manner, because that
    light then would have to be made by the higher angel and from this it would
    follow that he created that light, since such a light is not made out of
    matter. Therefore, it seems that one angel doe not illumine another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. If one angel is to be illurnined by another, then the illumined ange must
    be reduced from potency to act, because to be illumined is a kind of
    becoming. But whenever a thing is reduced from potency to act something in
    it must undergo corruption. Now, since nothing in an gels can corrupt, it
    seems that one angel is not illumined by another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. If one angel is illurnined by another, the light which one gives to the
    other is either a substance or an accident. Now, it cannot be a substance,
    because, as Aristotle says, when a substantial form is added to a thing, it
    changes the species of the thing, just as an added unit changes the species
    of a number; hence, it would follow that an angel, by the fact of being
    illumined, would undergo a specific change. Similarly this light cannot be
    an accident, because an accident does not extend beyond its subject. Hence,
    one angel does not illumine another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. Our sensible and intellectual vision needs light, because its object is
    only potentially visible and potentially intelligible, but, by means of
    light, becomes actually visible and actually intelligible. Now, the object
    of angelic knowledge is actually intelligible, because it is the divine
    essence itself or co-created species. Consequently, angels do not need
    intellectual light in order to know.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. If one angel illumines another, he illumines him with respect to either
    natural or gratuitous knowledge. However, he does not illumine him with
    respect to natural knowledge, because the natural knowledge had by both
    higher and lower angels is made perfect through innate forms; nor does he
    illumine him with respect to the gratuitous knowledge by which angels know
    things in the Word, because all angels see the Word directly. Consequently,
    one angel does not illumine another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. For intellectual knowledge, all that is required is an intelligible form
    and an intelligible light. Now, one angel does not give another angel
    intelligible forms, which are co-created, nor does he give him an
    intelligible light, because every angel is illumined by God, as we read in
    Job (25:3): “Is there any numbering of his soldiers? and upon whom shall not
    his light arise?” Therefore, one angel does not illumine another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. The purpose of illumination is to dispel darkness. But there is no
    darkness or obscurity in angelic knowledge. Consequently, the Gloss reads:
    “In the region of intelligible substances,”—clearly a reference to the
    regions where angels dwell—“the mind sees truth clearly, without any
    corporeal images, and not obscured by the mists of false opinions.” Hence,
    one angel is not illumined by another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. An angelic intellect is more noble than the active intellect of our
    soul. But the active intellect of our soul only illumines; it is never
    illumined. Therefore, angels are not illumined.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. We read the following in the Apocalypse (21:23): “And the city hath no
    need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it. For the glory of God hath
    enlightened it...” The Gloss expounds this text as referring to the
    principal and minor Doctors of the Church. Therefore, since an angel is
    already a citizen of that city, he is illumined only by God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    14. If one angel illumines another, he does this either through the
    abundance of the light given to him by his nature or through the abundance
    of light given him gratuitously. Now, one angel cannot illumine another
    through the abundance of his natural light, because the angel who fell
    belonged to the highest angels, and possessed the highest natural gifts,
    which, as Dionysius says, remained with him in their full strength.
    Consequently, a demon would be able to illumine an angel, and this is
    clearly absurd. Nor does one angel illumine another through the abundance of
    light given him gratuitously, because some men still living possess more
    grace than the lower angels do; indeed, because of their grace, they will be
    elevated to the ranks of the higher angels. Hence, a man still living could
    illumine an angel, and this is equally absurd. Therefore, one angel does not
    illumine another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    15. Dionysius says: “To be illumined is to receive divine knowledge.” Now,
    divine knowledge can be only that knowledge which is about God or divine
    things; and, in either case, angels can receive such knowledge only fro in
    God. Consequently, one angel does not illumine another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    16. Since the potency of an angelic intellect is entirely terminated by
    means of innate forms, these forms suffice for an angel to know all that he
    can know. Consequently, an angel should not need to be illumined by a higher
    angel in order to know something.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    17. All angels, or at least those belonging to different orders, differ
    specifically from one another. Now, nothing is illumined by a lig t
    belonging to another species; for example, a material thing is not illumined
    by a light that is spiritual. Therefore, one angel is not illumined by
    another.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    18. The light of an angel’s intellect is more perfect than the light of our
    active intellect. But the light of our active intellect suffices for us to
    know all the species we receive from our senses. Therefore, the light of an
    angel’s intellect is also sufficient for an angel to know all his innate
    species; consequently, no other light need be added to him.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Dionysius says that the angelic hierarchy is divided into “those who are
    illumined and those who illumine.” Therefore.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. just as there is a hierarchy among men, so is there a hierarchy among
    angels. This is clear from what Dionysius has written. Now, among men,
    superiors enlighten inferiors. For example, St. Paul says in the Epistle to
    the Ephesians (3:8-9): “To me, the least of all the saints, is given this
    grace, to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and
    to enlighten all men...” Therefore, superior angels likewise illumine
    inferior angels.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Spiritual light is more efficacious than material light. But higher
    bodies illumine lower bodies. Therefore, higher angels illumine lower
    angels.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    We should discuss intellectual light in terms of its resemblance to material
    light. Now, material light is a medium by which we can see things, serving
    our sense of sight in two ways:first, it makes things actually visible that
    were previously only potentially visible; second, its nature helps the sense
    of sight to see. Consequently, light must be in the very composition of the
    organ.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Similarly, intellectual light can be said to be the power of knowing which
    the intellect possesses, or even that thing by which another thing becomes
    known to us. There are two ways, therefore, in which a person can be
    illumined by another:first, his intellect can be strengtheped for the acts
    of knowledge; second, it can be guided by something to the knowledge of some
    other thing. Both of these actions are found together in the intellect; and
    we have a clear case of both of them happening together when the medium
    which a person mentally conceives strengthens his intellect to see some
    things which it previously could not see.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Accordingly, one intellect is said to be illumined by another in so far as
    the latter gives it some medium of knowledge, which strengthens it, and
    enables it to know some things which it previously could not know. Now,
    among men this takes place in two ways. First, it takes place through
    speech, as happens when a teacher, by what he says, gives some medium to his
    student that strengthens the latter’s intellect, enabling him to know things
    which he previously could not. In this sense, a teacher is said to enlighten
    his pupil. Second, a person can be given a sensible sign, and this can lead
    him to the knowledge of some truth. In this sense, according to Dionysius,
    priests are said to enlighten the people, inasmuch as they display and
    administer to them the mysteries which lead them to divine truths.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Angels, however, do not arrive at the knowledge of divine truths by means of
    sensible signs; nor do they receive intellectual media in a successive and
    discursive way, as we do, but immaterially. This is also what Dionysius
    held; for, when showing how the higher angels are illumined, he writes: “The
    highest essences, the angels, contemplate, [not] by gazing on symbols that
    can be known by the senses or intellect, nor by being led to God by the
    elaborations found in the Scriptures, but by being filled with the higher
    light of spiritual knowledge.” Consequently, for one angel to be illumined
    by another means simply this, that, through something seen in a higher
    angel, a lower angel’s intellect is strengthened to know other things.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This can take place in the following manner. Just as among bodies, higher
    bodies are, as it were, act with respect to lower bodies (as fire is, with
    respect to air), so a higher spirit is act, as it were, with respect to
    lower spirits. Now, every potency is strengthened and made perfect by being
    joined to its act. For this reason, lower bodies are preserved in higher
    bodies, which are the place of the former. Similarly, therefore, the lower
    angels can be strengthened by their being connected with the higher, and
    this connection takes place through intellectual intuition. For this reason,
    the lower angels are said to be illumined by the higher.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Augustine is speaking of that ultimate perfecting by which the mind is
    perfected with grace; and grace comes directly from God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. The illumining angel does not make a new light of grace or of nature; he
    merely shares his light. For, since whatever is known is understood by means
    of an intellectual light, the known as known includes in its notion a shared
    intellectual light that has the power to strengthen the intellect. This is
    evident if we consider the teacher who gives his pupil a medium
    <i>of</i> demonstration in which the light of the active intellect is
    contained as in an instrument; for, as the Commentator says,” first
    principles are quasi-instruments of the active intellect; and the same is
    true of all second principles which contain their own means of
    demonstration. Consequently, when a higher angel shows his knowledge to
    another angel, the intellect of the latter is strengthened so that it knows
    what it previously did not. Hence, no new light of nature or of grace comes
    into existence in the enlightened angel, but the hghv that was there
    previously is strengthened by the light contained in the higher angel’s
    knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Material and spiritual light are not entirely similar. For all bodies can
    be illumined by any material light whatsoever, since all material light is
    equally related to all visible forms; but not all spirits can be illumined
    by any light whatsoever, because not all lights contain intelligible forms
    in the same manner. The supreme light contains intelligible forms that are
    more universal. Consequently, it is not sufficient for an inferior intellect
    to be illumined by a higher light, since such an intellect is proportioned
    to receive its knowledge through forms that are more particular. To be led
    to the knowledge of things, this intellect must be illumined by an inferior
    light, as, of course, takes place in the case of men. For example, a
    metaphysician knows all things in their universal principles. A doctor,
    however, considers things especially in their particulars; hence, he does
    not take his principles directly from a metaphysician but directly from a
    philosopher of nature, whose principles are less general than those of a
    metaphysician. However, the natural philosopher, who considers things more
    universally than the doctor does, can take the principles for his science
    directly from the metaphysician.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Consequently, since the intelligible characters of all things are united in
    the highest degree in the light of the divine intellect, as in a single most
    universal principle, the lower angels are not proportioned to receive
    knowledge through such a light, unless there is joined to them the light of
    the higher angels, in whom the intelligible forms are made less universal.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. An angel illumines another angel, sometimes through a medium, sometimes
    without a medium. Illumination through a medium (which is, of course,
    spiritual) takes place, for example, when a very high angel illumines an
    angel that stands halfway in the angelic hierarchy, and when the latter, by
    means of the light given him by the first, illumines an angel in the lowest
    part of the hierarchy. On the other hand, illumination without a medium
    takes place when, for example, a superior angel illumines an angel existing
    immediately below him in the hierarchy. It is not necessary that the angel
    who illumines be directly joined to the mind of the angel who is
    enlightened; the two are joined together simply by the fact that one intuits
    the other directly.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. The medium that is known by the lower angel is numerically the same as
    that which is known by the higher; butthe knowledge which the higher angel
    has of that medium is other than that which the lower angel has.
    Consequently, in some sense, it is the same light, and, in another sense, it
    is another light. But even in the sense that it is another light it does not
    follow that it is created by the higher angel, because things which do not
    exist substantially do not, properly speaking, come into existence, just as
    they do not exist substantially. For example, as we read in the
    <i>Metaphysics</i>, it is not color but a colored thing that comes into
    existence. Consequently, the angel’s light does not come into existence, but
    the illumined angel, from being potentially enlightened, becomes actually
    enlightened.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. just as no form is removed but only the privation of light, namely,
    darkness, is removed when material illumination takes place, so does a
    similar removal take place in spiritual illumination. Consequently, it is
    not necessary for any corruption to take place when spiritual illumination
    occurs. There is merely a removal of a negation.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. That light by which an angel is said to be illumined is not one of his
    essential perfections but a second perfection, which is reduced to the genus
    of accidents. Moreover, it does not follow that the accident extends beyond
    its subject, because the knowledge by which the higher angel is enlightened
    is not numerically the same as that which is in the lower angel. Their
    knowledge is the same merely in so far as it has the same nature and belongs
    to the same species, just as the light which is in illuminated air and that
    which is in the illumining sun is specifically, but not numerically, the
    same.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. It is true that through light a thing which was potentially intelligible
    becomes actually so, but this can happen in two ways. First, it may be that
    that which is in itself only potentially intelligible becomes actually
    intelligible. This happens in our knowledge. But in this respect an angelic
    intellect does not need light, for it does not abstract species from
    phantasms. Secondly, it may be that that which is potentially intelligible
    to some particular knower becomes actually intelligible to him. This takes
    place, for example, when the higher substances become actually intelligible
    to us, that is, when we arrive at knowledge of them by reasoning. It is for
    such knowledge that an angel’s intellect needs light, that is, so it can be
    led to the actual knowledge of those things which it knows only potentially.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. The illumination by which one angel illumines another does not concern
    those things that belong to angels’ natural knowledge, because, in that
    case, all the angels would have perfect natural knowledge from the moment
    when they first existed—unless we held that the higher angels caused the
    lower, and this position is contrary to faith. It concerns, rather, the
    knowledge that is revealed to angels and the things that surpass their
    natural knowledge, for example, mysteries pertaining to the Church in heaven
    or on earth. Hence, Dionysius also speaks of a hierarchical action among
    angels. Moreover, it does not follow from thefact that all angels see the
    Word that, whatever the higher angels see there, the lower also see.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. When one angel is enlightened by another, new species are not infused
    into him, but, by the very same species which he had previously, his
    intellect is strengthened through a higher light, and, in the manner
    described, it is enabled to know more things. Similarly, when our intellect
    is strengthened by divine or angelic light, from the same phantasms it can
    come to know more things than it could know if left unaided.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. Although there is no obscurity or error in angels’ intellects, angels do
    not know things which surpass their natural powers of knowing. For this
    reason, they need light.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. No matter how material a thing is, it does not receive something else
    according to what is formal in itself, but only according to what is
    material in it. For example, our soul does not receive an illumination
    according to its active intellect but only according to its possible
    intellect. Similarly, material things do not receive impressions according
    to their own forms but merely according to their own matter. Yet our
    possible intellect is more simple than any material form. Similarly, an
    angel’s intellect is illumined only with respect to that which it possesses
    potentially, even though it is more noble than our active intellect, which
    is not illumined.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. That text should be understood as referring to the things that belong to
    the knowledge the blessed have. Without any intermediary God illumines all
    angels about these things.

    14. The illumination of which we are speaking takes place through the light
    of grace, which perfects natural light. Moreover, it would not follow that a
    man, still in this life, could illumine an angel, because he possesses
    greater grace only virtually, not actually. He has merely grace, by which he
    can merit a more perfect state, just as, in the same sense, a colt,
    immediately after birth, is said to have greater strength than an ass, even
    though its strength is actually less.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    15. When we say that to be illurnined is to receive divine knowledge, this
    knowledge is called divine merely because it has its origin in a divine
    enlightenment.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    16. Innate forms are sufficient for an angel to know all that he can know
    naturally; but, to know those things that are above his natural powers, he
    needs a higher light.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    17. It is not necessary for the intelligible lights existing in angels, who
    are specifically different, to be specifically different themselves. For
    example, color existing in bodies that are specifically different is
    nevertheless specifically the same. The same principle is especially true of
    the light of grace, which is specifically the same both in men and in
    angels.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    18. The light of the active intellect is sufficient for us to know those
    things that can be known naturally; but, to know other things, we need a
    higher light, such as that of faith or of prophecy.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It seems that he is illumined directly by God, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. An inferior angel is in potency to receiving grace in his will and
        illuminations in his intellect. Now, he receives only as much grace from
        God as he is capable of receiving. Therefore, he receives only as much
        illumination from God as he is capable of receiving. Consequently, he is
        directly illumined by God, and not through an intermediate angel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. just as superior angels stand midway between God and the inferior
        angels, so do the inferior angels stand midway between superior angels
        and men. Now, the superior angels sometimes illumine us directly. For
        example, a Seraph illumined Isaiah (Isaiah 6:6). Consequently, the
        inferior angels also are sometimes illumined directly by God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. just as there is a definite order of spiritual substances, so is
        there also a definite order of material substances. But God’s power
        sometimes acts directly on material things, passing over intermediate
        causes. For example, He sometimes raises a person from the dead without
        the co-operation of a celestial body. Consequently, He sometimes
        illumines inferior angels without the services of superior angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Whatever a lower power can do a high power can. Therefore, if a
        higher angel can illumine a lower angel, God can certainly illumine the
        lower angel directly. Hence, it is not necessary that God’s
        illuminations should always be given to lower angels by means of higher.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Dionysius says’ that God has established an unchangeable law that
        lower beings be led back to God through the mediation of higher beings.
        Consequently, God never directly illumines lower angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. just as angels are, by their very nature, superior to bodies, so are
        the higher angels, by their very nature, superior to the lower. Now, in
        matters related to God’s rule over material things, He never causes
        anything to happen without the ministry of His angels. This is clear
        from what Augustine has written. Consequently, God likewise never causes
        anything to happen in lower angels without the ministry of the higher.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Lower bodies are not moved by higher except through media. For
        example, the earth is moved by the heavens through the mediation of air.
        Now, the order of spirits resembles that of bodies. Consequently, the
        highest spirits do not illumine the lower except by means of
        intermediate spirits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Because of His goodness, God communicates His perfections to creatures
        according to their capacity. Consequently, He shares His goodness with
        them, not only so that they will be good and perfect themselves, but
        also so that they can, with God’s help, give perfection to others. Now,
        to give perfection to other creatures is the most noble way of imitating
        God. Hence, Dionysius says: “The most God-like of all actions is to
        cooperate with God.” On this principle rests the ordering of angels,
        according to which some illumine others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There have, however, been several opinions on this ordering. Some4 think
        that this order is so firmly fixed that nothing can happen outside of
        it, and it is always and in all cases preserved. Others, however,
        concede that this ordering is stable, but say that, while events usually
        happen according to it, it is sometimes passed over by the action of
        necessary causes—as when, by God’s dispensation, even the natural course
        of things is changed, and a new cause springs into being, as clearly
        itakes place in miracles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But the first opinion seems to be more logical for three reasons. First,
        it belongs to the dignity of higher angels that the lower should be
        illumined through them. It would detract from their dignity if the lower
        angels were sometimes illumined without their ministry. Second, the
        closer beings are to God, who is most unchangeable, the more
        unchangeable should they themselves be. For this reason, bodies here
        below, standing at a great distance from God, are sometimes defective in
        their natural action, while celestial bodies always preserve the motion
        prescribed by their natures. Consequently, it does not seem reasonable
        that the ordering of celestial spirits, who are closest to God, should
        sometimes be changed. Third, God does not make any change in the things
        of nature except for something better, namely, for something pertaining
        to grace or glory. But there is no state higher than the states of glory
        by which the orders of angels are distinguished from each other.
        Therefore, it does not seem reasonable that matters concerning the order
        of angels should sometimes be changed.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. God gives grace and illuminations to angels according to their
        capacity—with this difference, however, that, because grace pertains to
        the will, He gives grace to all of them directly; for there is no
        ordering in angels’ wills whereby one could act upon another. But God’s
        illuminations descend from Him to the lowest angels by means of the
        angels standing at the top and middle of the hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Dionysius gives two answers to this difficulty. First, the angel that
        was sent to cleanse the lips of the prophet belonged to the inferior
        angels, but, by equivocation, was called a Seraph since he cleansed the
        prophet’s lips by burning them with a glowing coal brought from the
        altar by tongs; hence, he was said to be a Seraph only because he burned
        or set on fire. Dionysius’ second answer is that this angel, belonging
        to a lower order, cleansed the lips of the prophet because he did not
        intend to summon him to himself but to God and a higher angel, since he
        acted by the power of both. This is why he showed the prophet the higher
        angel and God. Similarly, a bishop is also said to absolve a person when
        a priest absolves by the bishop’s authority. Following this
        interpretation, we need not say that this angel was called a Seraph by
        equivocation or that a Seraph illumined the prophet directly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The course of nature can have a more noble state; hence, it is proper
        for it to be changed at times. But there is nothing more noble than the
        state of glory. Therefore, no parallel can be drawn.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. It is not because of any defect in God’s power or in that of the
        higher angels that God and the higher angels illumine the lower through
        the mediation of angels between them and the lower angels. This order is
        kept merely to preserve the dignity and perfection of all; and this
        demands that many co-operate with God in the same action.

        It seems that he does not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. To be cleansed is to be freed from impurity. But there is no impurity
        in angels; consequently, one angel cannot cleanse another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. But it was said that this cleansing is not from sin but from
        ignorance or lack of knowledge.—On the contrary, since such ignorance
        cannot be the result of any sin in the beatified angels, for they have
        no sin, it must be the result of nature. Now, those things that are
        natural cannot be removed while the nature remains. Consequently, an
        angel cannot be freed of his ignorance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Illumination dispels darkness. Now, the only darkness which makes
        sense in regard to angels is the darkness of ignorance or of lack of
        understanding. Consequently, if their ignorance is removed when they are
        cleansed, their being cleansed and their being illumined come to the
        same thing, and the two should not be distinguished.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. But it was said that illumination is referred to the end-term, while
        cleansing is referred to the initial term.—On the contrary, in no way of
        taking them is there found a term that is other than the end-term or the
        initial term. Consequently, if those two hierarchical actions, purgation
        and illumination, are distinguished according as one is referred to the
        initial term and the other to the end-term, a third hierarchical action
        cannot be posited; but to deny such a third action is to oppose
        Dionysius, who places’ the action of perfecting third.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. As long as a thing is in the state of progression, it is not yet
        perfect. But, as the Master of the <i>Sentences</i> says, angels’
        knowledge grows in some way until judgment day. Hence, at the present
        time, one angel cannot perfect another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Illumination is the cause of perfecting, just as it is the cause of
        cleansing. Now, a cause must be prior to its effect. Therefore, just as
        illumination precedes perfection, so does it also precede purgation if
        the purgation be from ignorance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Dionysius distinguishes and orders these actions in this manner, saying:
        “The hierarchical order is such that some angels are cleansed, others do
        the cleansing, some are illumined, others illumine, some are perfected,
        others do the perfecting.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In angels those three actions pertain merely to their reception of
        knowledge; for this reason Dionysius says: “Purgation, perfection, and
        illumination are the reception of divine knowledge.” However, the
        distinction between them should be understood in the following manner.
        Two terms can be found in any generation or change, namely, the initial
        term and the end-term. Both, however, are found in different ways in
        different changes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In some changes the initial term is something contrary to the perfection
        to be acquired. For example, blackness is the contrary of the whiteness
        acquired when a thing becomes white. On the other hand, sometimes the
        perfection to be acquired does not have a contrary directly, but the
        dispositions existing in the subject before the change are contrary to
        the dispositions ordered to the perfection to be introduced. This
        condition is found, for example, when a soul is infused into a body.
        Again, it sometimes happens that nothing is presupposed for the
        introduction of the form except a privation or negation. For example, in
        air that is to be illumined only darkness precedes; and this is removed
        by the presence of light.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Similarly, there is at times only one end-term. For example, the endterm
        of the process of whitening is whiteness only. At other times, there are
        two end-terms, one of which is directed to the other. This is clearly
        the case when elements undergo change: one end-term is a disposition
        which demands a form, the other is the substantial form itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, in the reception of knowledge, we find the diversity mentioned
        above with respect to its initial term, because sometimes, before a
        person receives knowledge, there exists in him an error contrary to it.
        Again, at times there are in him beforehand only contrary dispositions,
        such as impurity of soul, an immoderate occupation with senseobjects, or
        something of this nature. Again, at other times, there may be in him
        beforehand only a privation or negation of the knowledge, such as exists
        in us whose knowledge increases from day to day. It is in this
        last-named sense that we should understand the initial term of
        illumination in angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Moreover, we find that there are two end-terms in the reception of
        knowledge. The first is that by which the intellect is perfected in
        order to know something. This end-term may be either an intelligible
        form, an intelligible light, or any medium of cognition whatsoever. The
        second end-term is the knowledge itself, which follows; and this is the
        final term in the reception of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In angels’ cleansing takes place through the simple removal of ignorance
        in the manner described; for this reason Dionysius says: “To receive
        divine knowledge is to be cleansed of ignorance.” The illuniination,
        however, takes place in the first end-term. Hence, Dionysius also says
        that angels are illumined in so far as something is manifested to them
        “through a higher illumination.” Finally, “perfection” takes place in
        the ultimate end-term; and, for this reason, Dionysius says: “They are
        perfected by the light of resplendent knowledge.” In other words,
        illumination and perfection are understood to differ as the informing of
        the sense of sight by a species of what is seen differs from the
        knowledge of the thing seen.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Drawing an analogy from the principles laid down above, Dionysius writes
        that the order of the deacons is to purify neophytes in the faith, that
        of priests is to illumine them, and that of bishops, to perfect them. He
        said this because deacons exercise their office over catechumens and
        those possessed by the devils; and, in these persons, there are
        dispositions contrary to illumination which are removed by the deacons’
        ministry. The duty of priests, however, is to teach and communicate the
        mysteries of the faith to the people; for these are, as it were, means
        for leading us to God. Finally, the duty of bishops is to uncover the
        spiritual riches that were concealed in the mystical symbols.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As Dionysius says, the cleansing of angels is to be understood as a
        cleansing, not from any impurity, but from lack of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. A negation or defect is said to be natural in two senses. In the
        first, it is said to be natural because the presence of such a negation
        is, as it were, due to nature. For example, not having an intellect is
        natural to an ass. Now, this kind of natural defect is never removed as
        long as the nature itself remains. In the second sense, however, a
        negation is said to be natural because to have some certain perfection
        is not due to nature. This kind of a negation is found especially when a
        faculty of the nature is not able to acquire a perfection of the sort
        mentioned. Such natural defects can be removed. For example, the
        ignorance boys have is removed, and our lack of glory is removed by the
        bestowal of glory. Similarly, the ignorance angels have can be removed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Illumination and cleansing are related to each other in the
        acquisition of knowledge by angels as generation and corruption are
        related in the acquisition of a natural form. Needless to say,
        generation and corruption are one in so far as they are in one subject,
        but they differ in their formal character.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The reply is clear from what has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. In our proposition, <i>perfection</i> is not taken as referring to
        all the knowledge an angel has, but only to a single act of knowledge;
        and he is perfected by this when he is led to the knowledge of some
        particular thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. just as form is, in some way, the cause of matter inasmuch as it
        gives matter actual existence, so, in some way, matter is the cause of
        form inasmuch as it sustains the form. Similarly, the things coming from
        form are, in a certain sense, prior to those coming from matter, but in
        the case of some the opposite is true. Now, because privation is related
        to matter, the removal of the privation is naturally prior to the
        introduction of the form according to the order in which matter is prior
        to form, namely, the order of generation. But the introduction of the
        form is prior according to that order in which the form is prior to
        matter, namely, the order of perfection. The same argument can be
        applied to the orders of illumination and perfection.

        1. Commenting on the words of Job (28:17), “Gold or crystal cannot equal
        it,” Gregory says: “In heaven everyone will be seen by others as now he
        does not even see himself.” But while on earth person does not have to
        speak to himself in order to know his ow idea. Consequently, in heaven
        it will not be necessary for him to speak to another so that he can know
        it. Hence, speech is unnecessary for beatified angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. In the same passage, Gregory writes: “When one’s face is seen, in the
        same instant, his conscience will be penetrated.” Therefore, in heaven
        speech is not required for one person to know another’s concept.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Referring to angels, Maximus writes as follows: “When spiritual
        creatures meet and leave each other, one knows far more clearly what the
        other wishes to convey than were they to speak to each other. For, in
        some way, they silently discuss things and communicate their thoughts to
        each other.” Now, since silence is opposed to speech, angels know what
        other angels want to signify, without having to speak.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. All speech takes place through signs. Now, a sign must be some thing
        that can be sensed, because, as is said in the <i>Sentences</i>: “A sign
        is that which, besides impressing a species upon the senses, make
        something else known.” Consequently, since angels do not receive their
        knowledge from sensible things, they do not receive it by mean of signs,
        and, hence, not through speech.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. A sign seems to be something that is more known to us but les known
        according to nature. Accordingly, the Commentator distinguishes between
        a demonstration through a sign and a perfect demonstration, the latter
        being a demonstration which is causal. Now, angels do not receive their
        knowledge from things posterior in nature, consequently, not from signs.
        Hence, they do not receive knowledge by means of speech.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. In all speech the speaker must arouse his listener to attention to
        his words, which, in our case, are produced by the voice of the speaker.
        But to listen to words of this kind is impossible for an angel.
        Therefore, speech is likewise impossible for him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. As Plato says,” speech was given to us so we could know signs of
        others’ wills. But one angel knows the signs of another angel’s will by
        knowing himself, because these signs are spiritual, and, by the same
        knowledge, an angel knows all spiritual things. Hence, since one angel
        knows the spiritual nature of another angel by knowing himself in the
        same way he knows his will. Therefore, he has no need of speech.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The forms within an angelic intellect are ordered to the knowledge of
        things, as in God the intelligible characters of things are ordered to
        their production, for angels’ intellectual forms resemble these
        characters. Now, all things and whatever exists in a thing, whether it
        be interior or exterior, are produced by means of these intelligible
        characters. Therefore, when an angel knows another angel by means of the
        forms within his own intellect, he also knows all that is within that
        angel; and, as a consequence, he knows that angel’s thought. Hence, the
        same must be said as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. We have two kinds of speech, namely, internal and external. Now, we
        do not say that there is external speech in angels, because, if this
        were true, angels would have to form vocal speech to speak to each
        other. However, as Anselm~ and Augustine” say, “Internal speech is
        nothing other than thought.” Therefore, it is not necessary to assert
        that there exists in angels any kind of speech other than thought.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Avicenna says that we speak because we have a multitude of desires.
        This evidently arises from our many needs, because, as Augustine
        remarks, we desire a thing only if we do not have it. Now, since we
        cannot say that angels need many things, we cannot say that they speak
        to one another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. One angel cannot know another’s thought through its essence, because
        it is not present through its essence, to the other’s intellect. Hence,
        he must know the other’s thought by means of a species. Now, of himself,
        an angel is able to know, by means of innate species, all that naturally
        exists in another angel. For the same reason, therefore, through these
        same species he knows all that takes place by the will of the other
        angel. Hence, it does not seem necessary to affirm the exist ence of
        speech in angels in order that one can make his thought known to
        another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Signs and nods are directed to the sense of sight, not to that of
        hearing, but speech is directed to the sense of hearing. Now, angels
        indicate their thought “by signs and nods,” for this is how the Gloss
        explains that verse in the first Epistle to the Corinthians (13:1): “If
        I speak with the tongues of men and of angels...” Therefore, angels do
        not use speech to communicate.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. Speech is a motion of a cognitive power. Now, the motion of a
        cognitive power terminates in the soul, not in something outside.
        Therefore, through speech, an angel is not directed to the manifestation
        of his thought to another angel.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. In all speech something unknown should be manifested by means of
        what is known. For example, we manifest our concepts by means of
        sensible sounds. Now, we cannot say that this is possible for angels,
        because, as Dionysius says, the nature of an angel, naturally known by
        other angels, has no shape. Hence, there is nothing in an angel’s nature
        that can be used to indicate what is not known about it. Consequently,
        for angels speech is impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. Angels are spiritual lights. But when light is seen it totally
        mamfests itself. Therefore, when an angel is seen, whatever is in him is
        totally known. Consequently, there is no need for speech among angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. We read in the first Epistle to the Corinthians (13:1): “If I speak
        with the tongues of men and of angels...” Now, tongues would be useless
        were there not speech. Consequently, angels speak.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. As Boethius says, what a lower power can do a higher power also can.
        Now, men can reveal their thoughts to other men. Therefore, angels can
        do the same. However, to reveal one’s thought means to speak it. Hence,
        angels possess speech.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Damascene says: “In their discourses, which are not oral, angels tell
        each other what their wills are, and also what are their plans and their
        thoughts.” Now, discourse can be had only through speech. Therefore,
        angels possess the power of speech.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There must be some kind of speech among angels, for, as we proved
        carlier, one angel does not have direct and particular knowledge of what
        lies hidden in the heart of another; consequently, an angel must have
        some way of manifesting his thought to another. This way can be called
        angelic speech, for what we call speech in our own case is simply the
        manifestation of an interior word, which we mentally conceive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We can understand how angels manifest their concepts to one another if
        we study the resemblance their speech has to things in nature, because,
        as Boethius says, forms in nature are quasi-images of immaterial things.
        Now, we find that a form exists in matter in three ways. First, it can
        exist imperfectly, that is, in a mode halfway between potency and act.
        This, for example, is how forms exist that are coming into existence.
        Second, it can exist in perfect act; and I mean a perfection such that
        the being having it is perfected in itself. Third, it can exist in
        perfect act in such a way that the being having the form also can
        communicate this perfection to another. Some things are bright
        themselves, but cannot illumine other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Intelligible forms exist in the intellect in a similar way. First, they
        can exist, as it were, halfway between potency and act, as a form
        possessed habitually. Second, they may exist in perfect act with respect
        to the knower. This is true when a knower actually thinks according to a
        form which he has within himself. Third, they may exist with a relation
        to some other being; and their transition from one being to the other (a
        transition, as it were, from potency to act) is made through the will.
        For the will of an angel causes him to turn actually to the forms he
        possesses, as it were, habitually; and, similarly, it makes his
        intellect actually more perfect with respect to the form within him, so
        that the angel is perfected, not only by this intellectual form itself,
        but also by the relation it has to another angel. When this takes place,
        his thought is perceived by the other angels; and, in this sense, one
        angel is said to speak to another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We would have the same way of speaking if our intellect could be
        directed to intelligibles without having to have recourse to media; but,
        because it is the nature of our intelligence to receive from the senses,
        sensible signs are used to express our interior concepts, and by these
        signs we manifest our heart’s thoughts.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Gregory’s statement can be understood of both physical and spiritual
        vision; for in heaven, after the bodies of the saints have been
        glorified, a saint will be able to see with his physical eyes the
        interior of another’s body—something which is now impossible. It will be
        possible then, because glorified bodies will in some way be transparent.
        For this reason, Gregory compares them to glass. Similarly, one will be
        able to see with his spiritual eyes whether or not another person has
        charity, and, if so, how much he possesses—something which is likewise
        impossible now. From this it does not follow, however, that one, will be
        able to know the actual thoughts of another, because these depend on the
        will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The conscience is said to be penetrated, but this is with respect to
        its habits, not to its actual thoughts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In this statement, silence is opposed to oral speech such as we have,
        not to spiritual speech such as angels have.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. A thing cannot be called a sign in the proper sense unless one can
        come to know something else as if by reasoning from it. In this sense,
        signs do not exist among angels, because, as we proved in the previous
        question, angels’ knowledge is not discursive. The signs we use are
        sensible, because our knowledge, which is discursive, has its origin in
        sense-objects. But we commonly call anything a sign which, being known,
        leads to the knowledge of something else; and for this reason an
        intelligible form can be called a sign of the thing which is known by
        its means. It is in this sense that angels know things through signs;
        and thus one angel speaks to another by means of signs, that is, through
        a species which actuates his intellect and puts it perfectly in relation
        to the other.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Although it is true that in natural things, whose effects are more
        known to us than their causes are, a sign is that which is posterior in
        nature, the notion of a sign, even properly speaking, is not such that a
        sign need be prior or posterior in nature, but only that it must be
        known previously by us. For this reason, at times we take effects as
        signs of causes, as when we judge health from the pulse, and at other
        times we take causes as signs of effects, as we take the dispositions of
        heavenly bodies as signs of stormy weather and rain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. When angels turn to others, as long as they put some of their
        intelligible forms into an actual relation to these others, the angels
        may be said to be arousing others’ attention to them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. It is true that an angel knows all spiritual things with the same
        kind of knowledge, that is, intellectually. But whether the knowledge of
        a thing comes through knowing oneself or through knowing something else
        concerns, not the type of knowledge, but only the manner in which this
        knowledge has been received. Hence, even if one angel knows the nature
        of another angel by knowing himself, it does not follow that he also
        knows the speech of the other in the same manner, because the thought of
        one angel is not as intelligible to another as his nature is.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. That reasoning would follow if the intellectual forms in an angel
        were as efficacious for the knowledge of things as the intelligible
        characters of things in God are for their production. But this is not
        true, since a creature is not in any respect equal to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Although angels do not speak exteriorly as we do, namely, through
        sensible signs, they do speak exteriorly in another manner. The
        direction of their thoughts to other angels can be called exterior
        angelic speech.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. A multitude of desires is said to be the cause of speech merely
        because desires give rise to a multitude of concepts and these concepts
        Vould be expressed only by signs that differ greatly. Now, animals have
        just a few concepts, which they can express by a few natural signs. But,
        since angels have many concepts, they need speech. However, their having
        many concepts is a sign of no desire other than that of one angel’s
        wanting to communicate his mental conception to another angel; and this
        desire is not a sign that he is imperfect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. One angel knows the thought of another through the innate species by
        which he knows that other angel, because through this same species he
        knows all that he knows about the other angel. Consequently, as soon as
        one angel relates himself to another angel according to an act of some
        form, the other angel knows his thought; and this depends on the will of
        the first angel. But the knowability of the angelic nature does not
        depend on the will of the angel. Therefore, angels do not need speech to
        know the nature of other angels but only to know their thoughts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. According to Augustine,” sight and hearing differ only exteriorly.
        Interiorly, in the mind, they are one and the same, because, in the
        mind, seeing and hearing do not differ. They differ only as they are in
        the external senses. Consequently, in angels, who have only minds, there
        is no difference between seeing and hearing. However, angelic speech
        gets its name from its resemblance to what takes place in us, for we
        receive our knowledge from others through our sense of hearing.
        Moreover, we can distinguish between angelic nods and signs in the
        following way:the species may be called signs, and the reference of the
        species to others, nods. But the very ability to do this is called their
        speech.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. Speech is a motion of a cognitive power; however, the motion is not
        in the cognition but in the manifestation of the cognition. Hence, this
        motion must have an order to another being. For this reason, the
        Philosopher also says: “Speech exists in order that one can signify
        something to another.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. The essence of an angel does not have a material shape, but his
        intellect is, as it were, shaped by its intelligible forms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. Physical light manifests itself because of a natural necessity.
        Consequently, it manifests itself in the same way in regard to
        everything it contains. An angel, however, possesses a will; and his
        concepts cannot be manifested unless his will commands that they be
        manifested. This is why an angel needs speech.

        1. In its explanation of that verse in the first Epistle to the
        Corinthians (13:1), “If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels,”
        the Gloss reads as follows: “These tongues are the means by which the
        superior angels tell the inferior angels what they are first to learn
        about the will of God.” Consequently, speech, an act of the tongue,
        belongs only to the higher angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Whenever anyone speaks, something takes place in his listener. Now,
        in the higher angels, nothing can take place that is caused by the
        lower, because the higher are not in potency with respect to the lower;
        rather, the opposite is true, since the superior angels have more act
        and less potency. Consequently, the lower angels cannot speak to the
        higher.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. To the notion of thought speech adds that of infusing knowledge. But
        the lower angels cannot infuse anything into the higher angels, because
        in that case they would be acting upon them, and this is impossible.
        Therefore, the lower do not speak to the higher angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. To illumine is simply to manifest something unknown. Now, angelic
        speech is for the manifestation of something unknown. Therefore, angelic
        speech is an illumination. Hence, since inferior angels do not illumine
        superior angels, it would seem that they also do not speak to them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The angel to whom another angel speaks is in potency to knowing what
        is expressed in the speech, and, by means of this speech, he comes to
        know it actually. Consequently, the angel speaking reduces the one
        spoken to from potency to act. Now, this is not possible for inferior
        angels with respect to superior angels, because in that case the
        inferior angels would be more noble. Hence, inferior angels do not speak
        to superior angels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. One person teaches another if he tells him something that he did not
        know. Consequently, if inferior angels speak to superior angels about
        their concepts, which the superior are ignorant of, it would seem that
        they teach the superior angels, and thus perfect them, since, as
        Dionysius says, to teach is to perfect. But this would be contrary to
        the hierarchical order, according to which inferior angels are perfected
        by superior.

        Gregory says: “God speaks to angels, and angels speak to God.” On the
        same principle, therefore, superior angels can talk to the inferior, and
        inferior to the superior.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To Iresolve this question satisfactorily, we must consider how, in
        angels, illumination differs from speech; and this can be done in the
        following way. An intellect falls short of knowing something for two
        reasons. First, the knowable object may be absent. For example, we do
        not know what has happened in past times or in remote places, if these
        happenings have not come to our attention. Second, there may be a defect
        in the intellect. That is, the intellect may not be strong enough to
        arrive at those truths which it already has in its possession, as, for
        instance, the intellect has all conclusions within itself in possessing
        first principles naturally known, but it does not know those conclusions
        unless it is strengthened by exercise or instruction. Properly speaking,
        therefore, speech is that by which a person is led to the knowledge of
        the unknown, because, through speech, something becomes present to him
        that would otherwise be absent. We have an evident example of this in
        our own case when one person shows another what the other did not see,
        and thus, in some sense, makes this thing present to him by nicans of
        speech. On the other hand, illumination takes place when the intellect
        is merely strengthened to know something above that which it already
        knew. We have explained this previously.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It should be noted, however, that both angels and men can have speech
        without illumination, because sometimes a thing is shown to us through
        speech only, and this does not strengthen our intellect in any way for
        knowing more. For example, one can recite to me merely a historical
        narrative, or one angel can reveal merely his thought to another angel;
        such matters can be equally known or not known by one having a strong
        intellect as well as by one having a weak intellect. But illumination in
        angels and men always has speech joined to it. For we illumine another
        person inasmuch as we give him some means by which his intellect is
        strengthened to know something, and this strengthening takes place
        through speech. In angels, this must also take place through speech,
        because the superior angel has his knowledge about things through forms
        that are more universal. Consequently, the inferior angel is not
        proportioned to receive knowledge from the superior unless the latter in
        some way distinguishes and divides his knowledge by conceiving within
        himself that about which he wishes to illumine in such a way that it
        will be comprehensible to the lower angel, and by manifesting this
        concept to him when he illumines him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consequently, Dionysius says: “In its providence, every intellectual
        essence divides and multiplies what it understands by one form, given to
        it by a godlike being, so that these divisions may act as guiding
        analogies for those below.”5 The same is true of the teacher who, seeing
        that his pupil cannot grasp things which he himself knows in the same
        way in which he knows them, makes a special effort to distinguish and
        multiply his knowledge by means of examples, so that his pupil will
        grasp his knowledge in this manner.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, we must admit that angelic speech joined with illumination is
        found only when superior angels speak to inferior; but the other type of
        angelic speech is used both when inferior angels speak to superior and
        when superior speak to inferior.

        2. The angel who speaks causes nothing in the angel to whom he is
        speaking. A change does take place, however, in himself; and, by reason
        of this change, he is known in the manner described above. Hence, there
        is no necessity for the angel speaking to infuse something into the one
        he is addressing.

        5. It is true that the angel to whom another angel speaks becomes an
        actual knower from being a potential knower; however, this takes place,
        not because he is reduced from potency to act, but because the angel who
        is speaking reduces himself from potency to act by making himself, with
        respect to some form, in perfect act according to an ordering to the
        other angel.

        6. Properly speaking, <i>teaching</i> is applied only to those things
        which perfect an intellect. However, the fact that one angel knows the
        thoughts of another does not pertain to his intellectual perfection,
        just as it does not pertain to the perfection of my intellect if I learn
        about things that are not present to me and in no way concern me.

        1.Whenever arrival and departure are involved, there is necessarily a
        determinate distance. But, as Maximus says, angels see each other’s
        thoughts as they approach and depart from one another. Therefore.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. According to Damascene, an angel is where he operates. Consequently,
        if he speaks to another angel, he must be where his listener is; hence,
        some determinate distance is involved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. We read in Isaiah (6:3): “They cried one to another.” Now, the only
        reason for making cries is that a distance separates us from the one to
        whom we are speaking. Therefore, it seems that distance impedes the
        speech of angels.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Speech must be carried from the one speaking to the one listening.
        Now, this is not possible unless local distance separates the angel
        speaking from the one listening, because spiritual speech cannot be
        carried by a material medium.. Therefore, local distance impedes the
        speech of angels.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. If Peter’s soul were on earth, it would know the events taking place
        here; but, since it is in heaven, it does not. Hence, the gloss of
        Augustine on Isaiah (6 3:16), “Abraham hath not known us,” says: “The
        dead”—even the saints—“do not know what the living are doing”—even their
        own sons. Consequently, local distance impedes the cognition of a
        separated soul, and, by the same reasoning, that of angels, and also
        their speech.

        The greatest possible distance separates paradise from hell; but the
        blessed and the damned can see each other, especially before the day of
        final judgment. This is clear from Luke’s account of Lazarus and the
        rich man (Luke 16:19-31). Consequently, no local distance impedes the
        cognition of a separated soul or that of an angel. By the same
        reasoning, it does not impede angels’ speech.

        An agent acts according to its manner of existing. Hence, things that
        are material and circumscribed by place have actions that are material
        and circumscribed by place; and things that are spiritual act in a
        spiritual manner only. Consequently, because an angel as a knower is in
        no way circumscribed by place, the action of his intellect has no
        relation to place. Hence, since his speech is an operation of his
        intellect, local distance or proximity does not affect it. Therefore,
        one angel can understand the speech of another, whether that other be in
        a near or distant place—in the sense in which we say that angels are in
        place.

        2. The statement that an angel is where he operates is to be under stood
        as referring to an operation which he carries out on some body; and this
        operation gets its place from that in which it terminates. Angelic
        speech, however, is not an operation of this kind. Hence, the argument
        does not follow.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The cries which the Seraphim are said to have made signify rather the
        magnitude of the things they spoke about, namely, the unity of God’s

        Holy, the Lord God of hosts...” (Isaiah 6:3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. As already stated, the angel addressed does not receive anything from
        the one speaking; but, through species within himself, he knows the
        other angel as well as what he is saying. Consequently, there is no need
        of positing a medium by which something could be carried from one angel
        to another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Augustine is speaking about the natural knowledge souls have. Through
        this, not even the saints can know what takes place here on earth. They
        can know these events, however, by means of the glory they have
        received. Gregory states, this explicitly when commenting on that verse
        in Job (14:2 1): “Whether his children come to honor or dishonor, he
        shall not understand.” But angels have a natural knowledge that is more
        perfect than that of the separated soul. Hence, no parallel can be drawn
        between a soul and an angel.

        1. For angelic speech, all that is required is an intelligible species
        and a turning to another angel. But, if that species and turning are
        known by one angel, so they are also known by another. Therefore, what
        an angel says is equally perceived by all.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Using the same “nods,” one angel can speak to all the angels.
        Consequently, if an angel knows the speech by which another angel

        others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Whoever sees an angel perceives the species by which that angel
        understands and speaks. But angels always see one another. Therefore,
        one angel always knows what another is speaking, whether that angel is
        speaking to him or to some other angel.

        same distance from him, unless there is some defect in one of the
        hearers, that is, if he is hard of hearing. Now, sometimes another angel
        is by nature or locally closer to the angel speaking than is the angel
        who is being addressed. Therefore, the angel speaking is heard by others
        than those whom he addresses.

        It seems inconsistent to assert that the angels cannot do something
        which we can do. But a man can confide to another what he has conccived
        in his heart in such a way that it remains hidden from others.
        Consequently, an angel is also able to speak to another without letting
        others know what he is saying.

        As is clear from what was said previously, the thought of one angel
        comes to the knowledge of another after the manner of spiritual speech
        from the fact that the latter angel is actuated by a species not only
        subjectively but also with reference to the former; and this occurs by
        the will of the speaker.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, it is not necessary that things subject to the will should be
        related to all in the same way, but only as the will determines. Hence,
        spiritual speech is not related to all angels equally, but only as the
        will of the angel who is speaking shall determine. Consequently, if, by
        his own will, an angel is actualized with respect to some intellectual
        species which he has directed to only one other angel, his speech will
        be known by that angel only; and, if his species has an order to
        several, several angels will know it.

        1. In angelic speech the turning or direction required is not one that
        is known but one that makes known. Hence, when one angel turns to

        2. In general, there is one “nod” by which an angel speaks to all
        angels; but, in particular, there are as many “nods” as there are
        turnings to the different angels. Consequently, every angel knows
        according to the “nod” made to him.

        everything depends on the will of the angel speaking.
