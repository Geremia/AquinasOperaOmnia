        >1. Dubium apud multos esse solet quomodo elementa sint in mixto.<br />
        There is usually a question among many men how the elements exist in a
        blend.</a

    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >2. Videtur autem quibusdam quod, qualitatibus activis et passivis
        elementorum ad medium aliqualiter reductis per alterationem, formae
        substantiales elementorum manent:<br />
        Now it seems to certain ones that the substantial forms of the elements
        remain, with the active and passive qualities of the elements having
        been reduced somehow to a mean through alteration.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >3. Si enim formae substantiales non maneant, corruptio quaedam
        elementorum esse videbitur et non mixtio.<br />
        For if the substantial forms do not remain, there will seem to be a
        corruption of certain elements, and not a blend.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >4. Rursus si forma substantialis corporis mixti sit actus materiae non
        praesuppositis formis simplicium corporum, simplicia corpora elementorum
        rationem amittent.<br />
        On the other hand, if the substantial form of the blended body be the
        act of matter, with the forms of the simple bodies not having been
        presupposed, the simple bodies would lose the notion of elements.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >5. Est enim elementum ex quo componitur aliquid primo, et est in eo, et
        est indivisibile secundum speciem;<br />
        For an element is [that] from which something is primarily composed, and
        it is in that [something], and it is indivisible according to
        species.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >6. Sublatis enim formis substantialibus, non sic ex simplicibus
        corporibus corpus mixtum componetur, quod in eo remaneant.<br />
        For with the substantial forms having been withdrawn, the blended body
        is not then composed from the simple bodies such that they would remain
        in it.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >7. Est autem impossibile sic se habere;<br />
        But it is impossible that they exist this way.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >8. impossibile est enim materiam secundum idem diversas formas
        elementorum suscipere.<br />
        For it is impossible that matter admit the different forms of the
        elements in the same respect.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >9. Si igitur in corpore mixto formae substantiales elementorum
        salventur, oportebit diversis partibus materiae eas inesse.<br />
        Therefore, if in a blended body the substantial forms of the elements be
        preserved, they must be present in diverse parts of matter.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >10.Materiae autem diversas partes accipere est impossibile, nisi
        praeintellecta quantitate in materia;<br />
        However, it is impossible that diverse parts of matter receive [these
        forms] unless through the quantity in matter having been
        pre-understood.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >11. sublata enim quantitate, substantia indivisibilis permanet, ut
        patet in primo <i>physic</i>.<br />
        For when the quantity has been withdrawn, the substance remains
        indivisible, as is clear in I <i>Physics</i> [185b 16].</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >12. Ex materia autem sub quantitate existente, et forma substantiali
        adveniente, corpus physicum constituitur.<br />
        Now a physical body is constituted out of matter under existing quantity
        and through the arriving substantial form.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >13. Diversae igitur partes materiae formis elementorum subsistentes
        plurium corporum rationem suscipiunt.<br />
        Therefore, the diverse parts of matter subsisting by means of the forms
        of the elements admits the notion of many bodies.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >14. Multa autem corpora impossibile est esse simul.<br />
        But it is impossible that [a thing] be many bodies at the same time.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >15. Non igitur in qualibet parte corporis mixti erunt quatuor
        elementa;<br />
        Therefore, the four elements will not be in any part of the blended body
        whatever;</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >16. et sic non erit vera mixtio, sed secundum sensum, sicut accidit in
        aggregatione corporum insensibilium propter parvitatem.<br />
        and thus there will not be a blend in truth, but according to sense,
        just as happens in the aggregation of bodies imperceptible because of
        [their] smallness.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >17. Amplius, omnis forma substantialis propriam dispositionem in
        materia requirit, sine qua esse non potest:<br />
        Furthermore, every substantial form requires a proper disposition in
        matter, without which it is not able to be;</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >18. unde alteratio est via ad generationem et corruptionem.<br />
        whence the way towards generation and corruption is alteration.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >19. Impossibile est autem in idem convenire propriam dispositionem,
        quae requiritur ad formam ignis, et propriam dispositionem quae
        requiritur ad formam aquae, quia secundum huiusmodi dispositiones ignis
        et aqua sunt contraria.<br />
        But it is impossible that the proper disposition which is required for
        the form of fire, and the proper disposition which is required for the
        form of water should come together in the same thing, because according
        to such dispositions fire and water are contraries.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >20. Contraria autem impossibile est esse in eodem.<br />
        Now it is impossible that contraries be in the same thing.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >21. Impossibile est igitur quod in eadem parte mixti sint formae
        substantiales ignis et aquae.<br />
        Therefore, it is impossible that the substantial forms of fire and water
        be in the same part of the blend.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >22. Si igitur mixtum fiat remanentibus formis substantialibus
        simplicium corporum, sequitur quod non sit vera mixtio, sed solum ad
        sensum, quasi iuxta se positis partibus insensibilibus propter
        parvitatem.<br />
        Therefore, if the blend is made when the substantial forms of the simple
        bodies remain, it follows that it is not a blend in truth, but only to
        sense, as it were, when the juxtaposed parts are imperceptible because
        of their smallness.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >23. Quidam autem utrasque rationes vitare volentes, in maius
        inconveniens inciderunt.<br />
        Some, however, wishing to avoid both accounts, have fallen into more
        unfitting [ones].</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >24. Ut enim mixtionem ab elementorum corruptione distinguerent,
        dixerunt formas substantiales elementorum aliqualiter remanere in
        mixto.<br />
        For in order that they might distinguish the blending from the
        corruption of the elements, they said that the substantial forms of the
        elements somehow remain in the blend.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >25. Sed rursus ne cogerentur dicere esse mixtionem ad sensum, et non
        secundum veritatem, posuerunt quod formae elementorum non manent in
        mixto secundum suum complementum, sed in quoddam medium reducuntur;<br />
        But on the other hand, lest they should be forced to say that it is only
        a blend to sense, and not according to truth, they maintained that the
        forms of the elements do not remain in the blend according to their
        entirety but are reduced into some mean.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >26. dicunt enim quod formae elementorum suscipiunt magis et minus et
        habent contrarietatem ad invicem.<br />
        For they say that the forms of the elements admit of more and less, and
        they have contrariety to one another.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >27. Sed quia hoc manifeste repugnat communi opinioni et dictis
        aristotelis dicentis in praedic., quod substantiae nihil est contrarium,
        et quod non recipit magis et minus;<br />
        But because this is manifestly repugnant to common opinion and to the
        statement of Aristotle saying in the Categories [5 (3b 24)] that nothing
        is contrary to substance, and that it does not admit of more and
        less,</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >28. ulterius procedunt, dicentes quod formae elementorum sunt
        imperfectissimae, utpote materiae primae propinquiores:<br />
        they go on further, saying that the forms of the elements are most
        imperfect, as [they are] nearer to prime matter.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >29. unde sunt mediae inter formas substantiales et accidentales;<br />
        Hence they are middles between substantial and accidental forms.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >30. Et sic, inquantum accedunt ad naturam formarum accidentalium, magis
        et minus suscipere possunt.<br />
        And thus, insofar as they approach to the nature of accidental forms,
        they are able to admit of more and less.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >31. Haec autem positio multipliciter improbabilis est.<br />
        This position, however, is multiply improbable.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >32. Primo quidem quia esse aliquid medium inter substantiam et accidens
        est omnino impossibile:<br />
        First, indeed, because to be a certain mean between substance and
        accident is wholly impossible;</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >33. esset enim aliquid medium inter affirmationem et negationem.<br />
        for there would be some mean between affirmation and negation.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >34. Proprium enim accidentis est in subiecto esse, substantiae vero in
        subiecto non esse.<br />
        For it is proper to an accident to be in a subject, but to a substance
        not to be in a subject.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >35. Formae autem substantiales sunt quidem in materia, non autem in
        subiecto:<br />
        Substantial forms, however, are in fact in matter, but not in a
        subject;</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >36. nam subiectum est hoc aliquid; forma autem substantialis est quae
        facit hoc aliquid, non autem praesupponit ipsum.<br />
        for a subject is a "this something", but a substantial form is what
        makes a "this something" âit does not, however, presuppose it.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >37. Item ridiculum est dicere medium esse inter ea quae non sunt unius
        generis; ut probatur in decimo <i>Metaph.</i><br />
        Likewise, it is ridiculous to say that the mean is something between
        those which are not of one genus, as is proved in X.
        <i>Metaphysics</i> [7 (1057a 20)].</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >38. Medium enim et extrema ex eodem genere esse oportet;<br />
        For the mean and extremes must be from the same genus.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >39. nihil igitur medium esse potest inter substantiam et accidens.<br />
        Nothing, therefore, is able to be a mean between substance and
        accident.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >40. Deinde impossibile est formas substantiales elementorum suscipere
        magis et minus.<br />
        Furthermore, it is impossible that the substantial forms of the elements
        admit of more and less.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >41. Omnis enim forma suscipiens magis et minus est divisibilis per
        accidens, inquantum scilicet subiectum eam potest participare vel magis
        vel minus.<br />
        For every form admitting of more and less is divisible per accidens,
        inasmuch as, namely, the subject can partake of it either more or
        less.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >42. Secundum autem id quod est divisibile per se vel per accidens,
        contingit esse motum continuum, ut patet in sexto <i>Physic</i>.<br />
        However, it happens that a motion is continuous according as something
        is divisible per se or per accidens, as is clear in VI.
        <i>Physics</i> [1 (231b 15)].</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >43. Est enim loci mutatio et augmentum et decrementum, secundum
        quantitatem et locum quae sunt per se divisibilia, alteratio autem
        secundum qualitates quae suscipiunt magis et minus, ut calidum et
        album.<br />
        For there is change of place and augmentation and dimunition according
        to quantity and place which are divisible per se; but alteration [is]
        according to qualities which admit of more and less, such as hot and
        white.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >44. Si igitur formae elementorum suscipiunt magis et minus, tam
        generatio quam corruptio elementorum erit motus continuus, quod est
        impossibile.<br />
        Therefore, if the forms of the elements admit of more and less, both the
        generation and corruption of the elements will be a continuous motion,
        which is impossible.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >45. Nam motus continuus non est nisi in tribus generibus, scilicet in
        quantitate et qualitate, et ubi, ut probatur in quinto <i>Physic.</i
        ><br />
        For motion is not continuous except in three genera, namely, in quantity
        and quality, and where, as is proved in V. <i>Physics</i> [1
        (225b9)].</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >46. Amplius, omnis differentia secundum formam substantialem variat
        speciem.<br />
        Furthermore, every difference according to substantial form variegates
        the species.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >47. Quod autem recipit magis et minus, differt quod est magis ab eo
        quod est minus et quodammodo est ei contrarium, ut magis album et minus
        album.<br />
        But that which receives more and less distinguishes what is more from
        that which is less and which in some way is contrary to it, such as the
        more white and the less white.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >48. Si igitur forma ignis suscipiat magis et minus, magis facta vel
        minus facta speciem variabit, et non erit eadem forma, sed alia.<br />
        If, then, the form of fire admits of more and less, the more having been
        made or the less having been made, it will variegate the species, and it
        will not be the same form, but another.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >49. Et hinc est quod philosophus dicit in octavo <i>Metaph.</i>, quod
        sicut in numeris variatur species per additionem et subtractionem, ita
        in substantiis.<br />
        And this is what the Philosopher says in VIII. <i>Metaphysics</i> [3
        (1043b 36)], that just as in numbers the species is variegated through
        addition and subtraction, so also in substances.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >50. Oportet igitur alium modum invenire, quo et veritas mixtionis
        salvetur, et tamen elementa non totaliter corrumpantur, sed aliqualiter
        in mixto remaneant.<br />
        Therefore, one must find another way by which both the truth of blends
        is preserved and yet the elements are not totally corrupted but, in some
        way, remain in the blend.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >51. Considerandum est igitur quod qualitates activae et passivae
        elementorum contrariae sunt ad invicem et magis et minus recipiunt.<br />
        It ought to be considered, therefore, that the active and passive
        qualities of the elements are contraries to each other, and they receive
        of more and less.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >52. Ex contrariis autem qualitatibus quae recipiunt magis et minus
        constitui potest media qualitas, quae sapiat utriusque extremi naturam,
        sicut pallidum inter album et nigrum, et tepidum inter calidum et
        frigidum.<br />
        Now a medium quality can be constituted from contrary qualities which
        receive of more and less, which are flavored with the nature of both
        extremes, such as gray between white and black, and tepid between hot
        and cold.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >53. Sic igitur, remissis excellentiis qualitatum elementarium,
        constituitur ex his quaedam qualitas media, quae est propria qualitas
        corporis mixti, differens tamen in diversis secundum diversam mixtionis
        proportionem:<br />
        So, then, by remitting the greatest qualities of the elements, there is
        constituted from out of these qualities some medium quality which is the
        proper quality of the blended body, differing nevertheless in diverse
        things according to the diverse proportion of the blend.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      <a name="Text" id="Text"
        >54. et haec quidem qualitas est propria dispositio ad formam corporis

        blended body, just as the simple quality is for the form of the simple
        body.</a

      </h3>

    <a name="note" id="note">
      <p>
        First, a word about my method of translation. Wherever possible, I try
        to avoid interpretation by strictly following the Latin text, even if
        that means giving unnatural english expressions. Less of a translation,
        this is meant to be an aid to the reader who wishes to tackle the Latin,
        but who is not altogether confident in his own Latin grammar and
        vocabulary. With this end, I have divided the text up into 60 phrases,
        each individually translated into English.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only a few points of the translation might require explanation. First of
        all, one may wonder why I have translated " <i>mixtio</i> " as "blend"
        throughout this work since there are several more common translations
        which one could use, such as "mixture" and "compound." I have preferred
        "blend," however, since it seems closer to the meaning of the doctrine
        of St. Thomas. It calls to mind something like the painter's blending of
        colors, wherein a medium is achieved which shares some of the powers of
        each of the colors blended. The reader ought to be aware of this bit of
        interpretation on my part, and verify for himself whether "blend" is the
        best word-choice here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that the problem with using the transliteration "mixture" is
        that it has a different meaning than " <i>mixtio</i> " as it is used in
        this context. The modern usage of "mixture," especially amongst
        chemists, corresponds to what Aquinas would call "non vera mixtio sed
        solum ad sensum." Examples of this would be a mixture of iron filings
        and sand. The components remain distinct in truth, though they appear to
        combine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that "compound" is closer than "mixture" to " <i>mixtio</i> " in
        Aquinas' sense, but it carries certain nuances that " <i>mixtio</i> "
        does not. When a chemical is called a compound, it implies that the
        parts continue to exist in some other ways in addition to power. For
        example, when the chemist says that water is compounded of hydrogen and
        oxygen, he implies not only that these elements go into the makeup of
        the new unity, which unity retains certain powers of the components, but
        that the compound retains a certain heterogeneity of parts whose parts
        have some of the properties corresponding to the those of the original
        components. Thus, when a college student calls something a compound,
        e.g. water, he imagines a mickey mouse head, with the ears being more
        hydrogen-like and the face more oxygen-like. This modern understanding
        of chemical unity, where the components are like the organs of the
        whole, may not be inconsistent with the doctrine of Aquinas, but I think
        it would be inaccurate to imply Aquinas was intending this notion by
        transLating " <i>mixtio</i> " as "compound."
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, I think "blend" is better than either of the alternatives
        which occurred to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I debated how I ought to translate to few instances of "virtus." In my
        first draft, I preferred "power," as did my proof reader, (despite a
        possible ambiguity with " <i>potestas</i> ",) but while I was studying
        another Latin text which used " <i>virtus</i> " in a similar context,
        (sci. " <i>De Occultis Operibus Naturae</i>,") I decided that "virtue"
        was a better translation, since it retained the equivocation of the
        Latin and the association with excellence that this implied. I changed
        my translation here, but I hesitate nonetheless, since in many circles
        "virtue" is primarily understood to mean a Victorian woman's chastity,
        and not manly excellence nor power, as it does in the Latin or Greek.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have tried as much as possible to be literal, so as to avoid too much
        interpretation, even when the correct sense seemed clear. This is
        difficult, especially for constructions like the ablative absolute. One
        can translate these into English using the preposition "by" and the
        perfect passive particle, but it is not a natural construction in
        English. My personal preference is to torture the English so as to leave
        the interpretation up to the reader, but I received so many objections
        from my proof reader for indulging in this, that I have not always
        followed my preferences in this version.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I decided not to footnote the text. I was tempted to identify
        the various objections with Avicenna et al. in footnotes, and reference
        the parallel texts, but decided that this might distract a student from
        the argument. A parallel passage in the <i>Summa</i> can be referred to
        should the student wish to identify these objectors. Since Aquinas
        himself supplements his arguments with those of Aristotle, and refers to
        his works, I did take the liberty to suggest in square brackets the
        exact place in the text of Aristotle of which Aquinas is thinking.
        Eventually, I hope to hypertext link all these references.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, I offer this translation for your use. Since the Latin is
        next to the English, it is very easy to check the translation against
        the original, and alter it as one prefers, e.g. changing the rarely used
        adverb "multiply" in line 31 to "in many ways", or the particle "saying"
        in line 27 to "who says". The Latin is not difficult and minor changes
        could easily be made. If greater changes are needed, the reader should
        be free to make them, e.g. if one preferred to have the Latin in a
        column beside the English, or if one wanted the Latin removed
        altogether, or if one wanted a more idiomatic English construction. The
        reader need simply download the electronic text and make one's own
        private changes. If the reader thinks that some portion of the
        translation is misleading, however, or correct, but overinterpreted, he
        can readily reach me by e-mail and suggest the corrections.
