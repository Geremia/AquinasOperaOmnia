                  In Christo enim est esse divinum et humanum; quae non possunt
                  esse unum, quia esse non dicitur univoce de Deo et creaturis.

                  Objection 1: For there is both a divine and a human being in
                  Christ; which cannot be one, because being is not said
                  univocally of God and creatures. Therefore, in Christ there is
                  not only one being, but two.

                      Praeterea, cuilibet formae respondet suum esse: aliud enim
                      est esse album, et aliud esse hominem. Sed in Christo sunt
                      duae formae; quia, cum in forma Dei esset, formam servi
                      accepit, ut dicitur Philipp. ii, non tamen formam dei
                      deposuit. Ergo in Christo est duplex esse.

                    <td style="text-align: justify">
                      Objection 2: Further, to any form corresponds its being;
                      for it is one thing to be white, and another to be a man.
                      But, in Christ there are two forms; since, "while he was
                      in the form of God, he took the form of a slave", as is
                      said in <i>Philippians</i>, 2:7, yet he did not set aside
                      the form of God. Therefore, in Christ there is a two-fold
                      being.

                          Praeterea, secundum Philosophum, in ii de Anima,
                          vivere viventibus est esse. Sed in Christo est duplex
                          vita; scilicet humana, quae fuit privata per mortem;
                          et divina, quae per mortem privari non potuit. Ergo in
                          Christo non est tantum unum esse, sed duo.

                          Objection 3: Further, according to the Philosopher, in
                          book II of the <i>de Anima</i> [com. 37], in living
                          things, living is being. But there is a two-fold life
                          in Christ; namely a human life, which he was deprived
                          of through death; and a divine life, which he could
                          not be deprived of through death. Therefore, there is
                          not only one being in Christ, but two.

                              said above. Therefore, there is only one being in
                              him.

                                  Respondeo. Dicendum quod huius quaestionis est
                                  quodammodo eadem ratio et praemissae; quia ex
                                  eodem dicitur aliquid esse unum, et ens. Esse
                                  enim proprie et vere dicitur de supposito
                                  subsistente. Accidentia enim et formae non
                                  subsistentes dicuntur esse, in quantum eis
                                  aliquid subsistit; sicut albedo dicitur ens,
                                  in quantum ea est aliquid album. Considerandum
                                  est autem, quod aliquae formae sunt quibus est
                                  aliquid ens non simpliciter, sed secundum
                                  quid; sicut sunt omnes formae accidentales.
                                  Aliquae autem formae sunt quibus res
                                  subsistens simpliciter habet esse; quia
                                  videlicet constituunt esse substantiale rei
                                  subsistentis. In Christo autem suppositum
                                  subsistens est persona Filii Dei, quae
                                  simpliciter substantificatur per naturam
                                  divinam, non autem simpliciter
                                  substantificatur per naturam humanam. Quia
                                  persona Filii Dei fuit ante humanitatem
                                  assumptam, nec in aliquo persona est
                                  augmentata, seu perfectior, per naturam
                                  humanam assumptam. Substantificatur autem
                                  suppositum aeternum per naturam humanam, in
                                  quantum est hic homo. Et ideo sicut Christus
                                  est unum simpliciter propter unitatem
                                  suppositi, et duo secundum quid propter duas
                                  naturas, ita habet unum esse simpliciter
                                  propter unum esse aeternum aeterni suppositi.
                                  Est autem et aliud esse huius suppositi, non
                                  in quantum est aeternum, sed in quantum est
                                  temporaliter homo factum. Quod esse, etsi non
                                  sit esse accidentale - quia homo non
                                  praedicatur accidentaliter de Filio Dei, ut
                                  supra habitum est - non tamen est esse
                                  principale sui suppositi, sed secundarium. Si
                                  autem in Christo essent duo supposita, tunc
                                  utrumque suppositum haberet proprium esse sibi
                                  principale. Et sic in Christo esset
                                  simpliciter duplex esse.

                                  <b>I answer that</b> in a certain measure
                                  solution of this question and the previous one
                                  is the same; because something is said to be
                                  one [esse unum] and to be a being [ens] from
                                  the same thing. For being [esse] is truly and
                                  properly said of the subsisting suppositum.
                                  For accidents and non-subsisting forms are
                                  said to be insofar as something subsists by
                                  means of them; just as whiteness is called a
                                  being, insofar as something is white by means
                                  of it. Now we should consider that there are
                                  some forms by which something is a being, not
                                  simply, but in a certain respect; [and] such
                                  are all accidental forms. But, there are some
                                  forms by which a subsisting thing has being
                                  simply; because, obviously, they constitute
                                  the substantial being of the subsisting thing.
                                  Now in Christ the subsisting suppositum is the
                                  person of the Son of God, which is made a
                                  substance simply through the divine nature,
                                  but it is not made a substance simply through
                                  the human nature; since the person of the Son
                                  of God existed before he assumed humanity, nor
                                  was he increased or perfected through having
                                  assumed a human nature. But, the eternal
                                  suppositum is made a substance through the
                                  human nature insofar as it is this man. And
                                  thus just as Christ is one simply on account
                                  of the unity of the suppositum, and two in a
                                  certain respect on account of the two natures,
                                  so he has one being simply on account of the
                                  one being of the eternal suppositum. But,
                                  there is also another being of this
                                  suppositum, not insofar as it is eternal, but
                                  insofar as it became a man in time. That
                                  being, even if it is not an accidental being,
                                  because man is not accidentally predicated of
                                  the Son of God, as was said above [art. 1] -
                                  nevertheless, it is not the principal being of
                                  its suppositum, but [its] secondary [being].
                                  Now if there were two supposita in Christ,
                                  then each suppositum would have its own
                                  principle being. And thus there would be a
                                  two-fold being in Christ simply.
