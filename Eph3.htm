var WPFootnote1 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The favors granted to the whole human race are treated in Chapter One, Lectures 1 and 2, those to the apostles in\
 Chapter One, Lectures 3 and 4.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote2 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Y. Congar, O.P., has pointed out in <i>l&#8217;Episcopat et l&#8217;Eglise universelle <\/i>(Paris: ed. du Cerf, 1962) pp. 106-23, how\
 &#8220;utilitas&#8221; in these contexts does not connote a self-centered or pragmatically successful utility. The Fathers and early\
 theologians used it to designate the supernatural care Christian authority must take regarding the good of persons,\
 especially their spiritual well-being. In listing &#8220;utilitas&#8221; as an essential motive for martyrdom, St. Thomas reveals\
 its spiritual and salvific character, its opposition to any short-sighted pragmatism, and the difficult duties with which\
 it can confront Christians.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote3 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>&#8220;Sacraments&#8221; here is probably to be taken in the broad sense of &#8220;sanctifying mysteries,&#8221; cf. note 52 above. On the\
 central role the mystery of God&#8217;s call to the Gentiles played in the vocation and theology of St. Paul, cf. Cerfaux,\
 <i>The Church in the Theology of St. Paul, pp. <\/i>176-86, 311-12.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote4 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Notice how the apostolic &#8220;dignitas&#8221; involves being of service to the people of God. In his commentary on St.\
 Matthew&#8217;s Gospel, ch. 20, he outlines the difference between the Christian dignity of the Apostles, and those who\
 are their successors, and the prestige enjoyed by political authority. The dignity of truly Christian authority consists\
 in its ministering to the faithful, cf. Y. Congar, &#8220;Authority as Service,&#8221; <i>Perspectives, <\/i>Nov.-Dec. 1963, pp. 167-70.\
 This same concept of dignity is mentioned in Lectures 2 and 3 of this chapter.<\/p>\

 pp. 38-39, and <i>De Doctrina Christiana <\/i>IV, 4; translated by J. Gavigan, O.S.A., <i>Christian Instruction, <\/i>F. C. 1947,\
 pp. 172-73.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote6 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Paul referred to his special religious insights as <i>ten sunesin mou<\/i>; the Vulgate rendered this as &#8220;prudentiam\
 mean&#8212;hence St. Thomas&#8217; allusion to prudence&#8212;which the Douay-Rheims translated as &#8220;knowledge.&#8221;<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote7 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>According to Aquinas the Old Testament leaders enjoyed an explicit, though vague, faith in Christ and the Trinity,\
 cf. note 59 of Introduction. This gave the faith even in its material determinations (cf. note 50 above) a strong\
 continuity. In line with the references in notes 56 and 57 above, the faith remains substantially the same but\
 undergoing a dynamic growth which brings out its inner potentialities, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 1, 7. Regarding the two central\
 mysteries of our faith, St. Thomas distinguished three main stages of their development:<\/p>\
<p>a.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<\/span>Before the Mosaic Law: Abraham and his clan instructed in what pertains to faith in the Godhead. Only vague\
promises of a Messiah (cf. Gen. 3:15).<\/p>\
<p>b.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<\/span>Mosaic Law: The pre-Mosaic faith in God is further refined and extended to the whole Israelite nation.\
Messianic expectations increase.<\/p>\
<p>c.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<\/span>Law of Grace: Divinity revealed as Trinity in Unity. The Word becomes incarnate. (cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 174, 6).<\/p>\
 <p>Moral doctrine is also present in this development, but it is more conditioned by the needs of particular times (<i>ibid.).\
 <\/i>In each stage the first revelations are the more excellent, they give the stage its overall direction. Other revelations,\
 or inspired religious insights, follow until the next stage gives salvation-history a new direction. This brings out the\
 primary importance of the Apostles and the early Church with its witness to Christ for all the succeeding generations\
 of Christians, cf. Chapter 1, Lect. 3 and Ch. 4, Lect. 4 of this commentary. For a perceptive application of these ideas\
 to the problems of Scriptural inspiration, cf. K. Rahner, S.J., <i>Inspiration in the Bible <\/i>(New York: Herder &amp; Herder,\
 1961).<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote8 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>In interpreting &#8220;generations&#8221; as temporal succession, Aquinas extends it to cover the angels. They are beyond the\
 space-time categories men experience (<i>S.T.<\/i> I, 52, 1c). Yet they do experience a certain succession in intellectual and\
 volitional acts <i>(ibid., <\/i>57, 3 ad 2; 61, 2 ad 2; 63, 6 ad 4), and their influence on material creatures also involves them\
 in temporal continuity (<i>ibid.<\/i>, 53).<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote9 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>From the following paragraph we see that the &#8220;sacrament of faith&#8221;&#8212;cf. note 52 above&#8212;was the call of the Gentiles\
 to become God&#8217;s own people, cf. note 73 above. Yet, this mystery was so intimately connected with the coming of\
 Christ, that St. Thomas also seems to be referring to the Incarnation as the &#8220;sacrament of faith.&#8221; Cf. note 59 of the\
 Introduction for references to the explicit faith of Old Testament leaders.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote10 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>God has assisted Paul by granting him both the capability (&#8220;facultas&#8221;) of realizing supernatural mysteries in human\
 history, and by assisting him to actualize these very capacities he has given. On the distinction between capacity to\
 act and the action itself, cf. note 51 above. This divine action does not impinge on human freedom, it is the cause\
 of that freedom. St. Thomas set the divine action in the perspective of eternity-time relations; God comprehends the\
 total extension of time in one ever-present act of understanding. From this it follows that he wills events without\
 detracting from their contingency (<i>S.T.<\/i> I, 19, 8), just as he knows contingent events infallibly (<i>ibid., <\/i>14, 13). For our\
 free actions, like all other contingent occurrences, are contingent only as long as they have not happened; e.g., you\
 do not have to read this note, but as long as you are reading it, even though it is a contingent act, you necessarily are\
 reading it. Freedom of action does not imply that man can do something and not do it at exactly the same instant.\
 And once we are in this sphere of actual existence we are in the domain of God&#8217;s proper causality, cf. note 35 above.\
 Thus God is a transcendent cause of human actions, especially those which are supernatural, because of the radical\
 relation temporal and created existence has to his Eternal and Perfect Being, cf. B. Lonergan, &#8220;St. Thomas&#8217; Theory\
 of Operation,&#8221; <i>T.S.<\/i>, Vol. 3, pp. 387-95; and &#8220;St. Thomas&#8217; Thought on <i>Gratia Operans,&#8221; ibid., <\/i>pp. 533-47; a\
 summary is given in his <i>Insight, <\/i>pp. 661 ff.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote11 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>&#160;The Gloss is from Peter Lombard&#8217;s <i>Collectanea, <\/i>P.L. 192, col. 188. Notice the salvific or redemptive value of\
 Chrises resurrection, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> III, 56, 1-2; 57, 6.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote12 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>&#160;Traces, or the &#8220;vestigia,&#8221; of the Triune God are present in the whole of creation. The substantial principle of each\
 being is a vestige of God the Father; the intelligible patterns or structure of its being are evidences of the Word; and\
 the interrelations it has with other creatures are a faint trace of the Holy Spirit, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 45, 7. These traces are\
 distinguished from the &#8220;image&#8221; of God which is applicable only to rational creatures, <i>ibid., <\/i>93, 2 &amp; 6.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote13 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>In the cosmic view of Aristotle, the sun was responsible for the coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be (&#8220;generatio et\
 corruptio&#8221;) of material objects in the sublunary spheres. While causing organic life to appear on earth <i>(In II De\
 Coelo<\/i>, 14, 426), it was only a partial cause&#8212;St. Thomas maintains&#8212;of human life (S.T. 1, 91, 2 ad 2).<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote14 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>All created causes are second causes, as distinguished from God who is the First Cause, cf. note 65 above. Material\
 causes are subject to scientific investigations which can uncover their intelligible patterns, and their correlations with\
 other material objects.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote15 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas often uses &#8220;saeculum to refer to a limit of existence or a duration of time, rather than in the sense of\
 the &#8220;world&#8221; or &#8220;earth,&#8221; cf. <i>In I De Coelo, <\/i>21, 9; <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 10, 2 ad 2; 6 ad 1. So Aquinas took the &#8220;praefinitionem\
 saeculorum&#8221; of Eph. 3:11 to refer to God&#8217;s &#8220;eternal purpose&#8221; (as the Douay-Rheims translates it, correctly giving\
 the meaning of the Greek <i>kata prothesin ton aionon<\/i>)<i> <\/i>precisely as it predetermines, or prelimits, temporal durations.\
 Cf. note 104 below.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote16 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The text which Aquinas quoted had &#8220;gloriae&#8221; instead of &#8220;gratiae.&#8221; Although some Vulgate codices have &#8220;gloriae,&#8221;\
 most follow the <i>tes charitos <\/i>(&#8220;of the grace&#8221;) found in the Greek.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote17 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Both the Scriptural references St. Thomas offers literally mean earthly princes and magistrates. Following Patristic\
 usage, which only echoes biblical traditions, Aquinas gives these terrestrial functions a celestial archetypal\
 counterpart, to use M. Eliade&#8217;s terminology, cf. Cosmos <i>and History <\/i>(New York: Harper and Bros., 1959), pp. 6-11.\
 This does not mean that they are empty metaphors; faith assents to the realities these symbols point to, in this case\
 the existence of created spirits. On the difference and relation between symbol as a &#8220;Modus significandi&#8221; and the\
 supra-human realities they signify, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 13, 1-6. Thus, in this lecture, St. Thomas will refer to the heavenly\
 Church as the &#8220;pattern&#8221; or &#8220;exemplar&#8221; of the earthly Church. Ultimately all created beings are patterned after the\
 divine &#8220;ideas,&#8221; cf. <i>ibid.<\/i>, I, 15.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote18 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>From the Lombard&#8217;s <i>Collectanea<\/i>, P.L. 192, col. 189, B.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote19 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 62, 1-4; 1-11, 1-3. Man, as a rational animal, cannot escape acting for some ultimate end (q. 1); created\
 goods such as money, pleasure, health, fame or power are insufficient to satisfy him (q. 2); since it must be a good\
 which really fulfills his intellectual and moral capacities (q. 3). <i>A fortiori <\/i>does this apply to a purely spiritual being.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote20 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p><i>Super Genesim ad Litteram, <\/i>V. 19 (P.L. 34, 335). St. Thomas opted for the opinion&#8212;which he expresses\
 here&#8212;that the angels were created at the same time as the material universe, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 61, 3. There was no time\
 &#8220;before&#8221; creation since time only began when creatures subject to change existed, cf. note 92 below. There are two\
 sources of angelic knowledge. Their natural mode of knowledge is to receive the ideas from God (cf. note 36 above)\
 and from the mediation of higher angels (<i>S.T.<\/i> I, 106, 1 &amp; 4). Now that they are beatified, they also immediately intuit\
 the Trinity, <i>ibid.<\/i>, I, 62, 1. Thus, St. Augustine in <i>Super Genesim ad Litteram <\/i>IV, 22, 26 (P.L. 34, 311-14) coined\
 the distinction between &#8220;cognitio matutina&#8221; referring to the knowledge they receive in the beatific vision from the\
 Primordial Cause of all reality, the Word; and the &#8220;cognitio vespertina&#8221; which designated the knowledge they acquire\
 naturally from themselves and other creatures, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 58, 6 &amp; 7; 117, 2 ad 1.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote21 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Since a building lacks human intellectual powers it cannot actively teach men, but men can learn from it or, as\
 Thomas puts it, in it. Likewise, man cannot actively instruct angelic minds (S.T. 1, 117, 2), but the latter can learn\
 of God&#8217;s plans for salvation as they actually unfold in human history.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote22 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>That creation began in time might seem paradoxical, time never existed prior to creation. In this sense it could be\
 held that creatures &#8220;always&#8221; existed since there was never a time when they did not, cf. A. Sertillanges, O.P.,\
 &#8220;Creation,&#8221; in <i>God and His Creation, <\/i>(Chicago: Fides, 1955) pp. 189-190. By creatures having a beginning, St.\
 Thomas means that time, or the duration of creatures, does not stretch back into a past that never ends (<i>S.T.<\/i> I 46).<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote23 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Teacher is Peter Lombard who refers to <i>Super Genesim ad Litteram <\/i>(cf. note 90 above) in his <i>Collectanea,\
 <\/i>P.L. 192, col. 189. He received the title of &#8220;Magister&#8221; due to the widespread use of his <i>Sentences <\/i>as a theological\
 text in Medieval European universities. This acclaim was increased by the Fourth Lateran Council openly adopting\
 his Trinitarian doctrine, cf. J. De Ghellinck, &#8220;Pierre Lombard,&#8221; in <i>D.T.C. <\/i>12, col. 2012-15.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote24 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The reference is to the <i>Collectanea <\/i>as given in the preceding note. For Dionysius cf. note 33 and 36 above; the\
 reference is to the <i>De Coelestia Hierarchia, <\/i>Ch. 7 ff.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote25 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Prayer of Manasse is a short apocryphal work written in Greek at the beginning of the Christian era. Taking\
 a cue from 2 Par. 33:18-19, an anonymous Jew wrote a prayer expressive of the sentiments which the scriptural text\
 gives us to understand were those of Manasse.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote26 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Potentialities are the ground of habits. To follow up on the illustration given in note 51 above, it would be\
 impossible for men to acquire mathematical habits if they did not possess intellectual potentialities. It is these radical\
 potentialities that are conditioned by the learning process so that habits are acquired. Cf. <i>In V. Meta., <\/i>Lect. 14, n.\
 960 and Lect. 20, n. 1064; Rowan&#8217;s translation Vol. 1, pp. 369 and 401; also <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 77.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote27 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The second interpretation of this passage is given in this lecture below.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote28 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Septuagint gives the reading St. Thomas quotes; also the Itala Latin translation, which predated St. Jerome&#8217;s\
 Vulgate and was used by St. Augustine. However, the Hebrew Massoretic text has <i>lo&#8217; te&#8217;amenu: <\/i>&#8220;If you do not\
 believe you will not be established.&#8221;<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote29 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Medieval theologians distinguished various qualities and gifts of the blessed in heaven. Insofar as beatitude was\
 likened to a marriage with Christ, or a marriage feast, certain gifts were discussed under the imagery of dowries. One\
 of these was the &#8220;comprehension&#8221; or &#8220;enjoyment&#8221; the saints possess in the beatific vision, cf. Suppl. 95, 5.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote30 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>&#160;In his <i>De Divinis Nominibus, <\/i>Ch. 9 (P.G. 3, 913). For St. Thomas&#8217; comments on this chapter cf. Lecture 2.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote31 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Cf. note 48 above.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote32 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Some manuscripts note that &#8220;Ut dicitur Ephes. III&#8221; is a superfluous addition to the text. It probably refers to v. 17-18. The quotation from Ps. 118:96 most likely refers to Christ&#8217;s commandment in Mt. 5:44: &#8220;But I tell you, love your\
 enemies and pray for your persecutors.&#8221; St. Thomas connects &#8220;height&#8221; with the love of heaven since there God will\
 be perfectly loved for his own sake, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 26, 13. Yet this love in heaven is not without its paradox, we shall\
 love God perfectly then because we will see him as the unbounded fulfillment of man&#8217;s striving for goodness. To\
 love God perfectly is, in this sense, the greatest love of self, <i>ibid.<\/i>, 26, 13 ad 3; also note 64 above. Perhaps this is\
 what Aquinas meant in his quote from Job 40:5. His ascribing these four dimensions to charity is similar to St.\
 Gregory&#8217;s in his <i>Homiliarum in Ezechielem Prophetam, <\/i>VI, 19, and St. Augustine&#8217;s in <i>De Doct. Christ. <\/i>2, 41.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote33 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p><i>&#160;Soliloquies, <\/i>II, 1, 1. Translated by T. Gilligan, O.S.A., F.C. 1948, p. 381. For St. Paul&#8217;s concept of perfection\
 through knowledge, cf. J. Forestell, &#8220;Christian Perfection and Gnosis in Phil. 3:7-16,&#8221; <i>C.B.Q. <\/i>April, 1956, pp. 126-36. The &#8220;scientia afficiente&#8221; St. Thomas here speaks of is the same as the &#8220;sapida scientia,&#8221; the knowledge that\
 spirates love, which he discusses in <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 43, 5 ad 2. For him the wisdom that is joined with love is both speculative\
 and practical, <i>ibid., <\/i>II-II, 45, 3.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote34 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas interprets &#8220;saeculi saeculorum.&#8221; as referring to the &#8220;age&#8221; which embraces all other times, the span of\
 duration during which creatures have existed&#8212;cf. note 85 above. This age is termed &#8220;aevum&#8221; in <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 10, 5-6; it\
 is the duration proper to the unchangeable existence of the heavenly bodies which, nevertheless, undergo local\
 motion (cf. note 35 above). It is also the duration proper to the angels insofar as their existence is immutable, yet\
 they do experience change in their understanding and will. Hence, this age of &#8220;aevum&#8221; lies between eternity, which\
 knows no before and after but is &#8220;tota simul,&#8221; and the time which we experience, essentially consisting in succession.<\/p>\

Three reasons account for this. First, because the Apostles received the revelation immediately from the Son of God: “The only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him” (Jn. 1:18). The prophets and fathers of the Old Testament, on the other hand, were taught by angels, or through some similar imagery: “And one of the seraphims flew to me: and in his hand was a live coal which he had taken with the tongs off the altar” (Is. 6:6). Hence, the Apostles received it more clearly. Secondly, they did not see in symbols and riddles as the prophets did, but were given a plain view of the Lord’s glory: “Blessed are the eyes that see the things which you see” (Lk. 10:23). Thirdly, since the Apostles were meant to carry into effect and communicate this sacrament, it was necessary for them to be more instructed in it than others. “Others have labored; and you have entered into their labors” (Jn. 4:38).

They had the promised inheritance: “For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world; but through the justice of faith” (Rom. 4:13); “The Lord is the portion of my inheritance” (Ps. 15:5). Another was their special election, they were set apart from the Gentiles: “The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be his peculiar people of all peoples that are upon the earth” (Deut. 7:6). “We are his people and the sheep of his pasture” (Ps. 99:3); “One is my dove: my perfect one is but one” (Cant. 6:8). Finally, they had the promise of a Christ: “In thee shall all the kindred of the earth be blessed” (Gen. 12:3).

VIII, 11: <i>multi ab oriente et occidente venient, et recumbent cum Abraham, Isaac et Iacob in regno caelorum</i>, et cetera.<br>
          secundo ad speciale collegium fidelium, et, quantum ad hoc, dicit <i>et concorporales</i>, id est in unum corpus. Io. X, 16: <i>alias oves habeo quae non sunt ex hoc ovili</i>, id est gentes, <i>et illas oportet me adducere, et vocem meam audient, et fiet unum ovile et unus pastor</i>.<br>
          tertio, ad participationem gratiae repromissae, et quantum ad hoc dicit <i>et comparticipes</i>, scilicet promissionum quae factae sunt Abrahae. Rom. XV, 8: <i>dico autem Christum fuisse ministrum circumcisionis propter veritatem Dei ad confirmandas promissiones patrum, gentes autem super misericordia honorare Deum</i>.
          <td>These three the Gentiles did not enjoy: “You were at that time without Christ, being aliens to Israel’s way of life” (Eph. 2:12 ‘). By faith, however, they have received them. First, they share in the inheritance; concerning this he says <span style="font-weight: bold">fellow heirs</span> with the Jews in the heavenly inheritance. “And I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven” (Mt. 8:11). Second, [they are admitted] to the chosen community of believers; thus he states <span style="font-weight: bold">of the same body,</span> that is, in one body. “And other sheep I have that are not of this fold,” namely, the Gentiles, “them also I must bring. And they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd” (Jn. 10:16). Third, [they are admitted] to a participation in the promised grace; he says they are <span style="font-weight: bold">co-partners of his promise</span>, the promises made to Abraham. “For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers; but that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy” (Rom. 15:8-9).

Item, nec per impletionem legis, quia hoc est iugum quod <i>neque patres nostri, neque nos portare potuimus</i>, ut dicitur Act. XV, 10, sed <i>per Evangelium</i>, per quod omnes salvantur. Rom.

Moreover, these did not come through fulfilling the law, whose burden “neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear” (Ac. 15: 10), but <span style="font-weight: bold">by the gospel</span> through which all men are saved. “For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first and to the Greek” (Rom. 1:16). “Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received and wherein you stand. By which also you are saved” (1 Cor. 15:1-2).

Facultatem autem dat Deus infundendo virtutem et gratiam, per quas efficitur homo potens et aptus ad operandum; sed ipsam operationem confert inquantum operatur in nobis interius movendo et instigando ad bonum. Et ideo hoc accipiens apostolus a Deo, dicit quantum ad primum: dico quod <i>factus sum minister</i>, sed certe non meis meritis, nec virtute propria, sed <i>secundum donum gratiae Dei quae data est mihi</i>, quia scilicet idoneus efficior ad executionem divinorum mysteriorum, qui fui prius persecutor.

Secundum ergo hunc modum Paulus gratiam sibi commissi officii commendat, dicens <i>mihi enim omnium sanctorum minimo data est gratia haec</i>. Et vocat se minimum, non ex potestate sibi commissa, sed ex consideratione status praeteriti. I Cor. XV, 9: <i>ego sum minimus apostolorum, qui non sum dignus vocari apostolus, quoniam persecutus sum Ecclesiam Dei</i>. Is. LX, 22: <i>minimus erit in mille, et parvulus in gentem fortissimam</i>. Et hoc <i>in gentibus</i>, id est inter gentes, Gal. II, 8-9: <i>qui enim operatus est Petro in apostolatum circumcisionis, operatus est et mihi inter gentes.

          <td>The office confided to him is recommended from this person’s condition. For if some king entrusted an important office to a great and high-ranking prince, he would not be doing him a very great favor since he would be placing an important person in an important position. But if he entrusts a great and exceedingly difficult duty to an insignificant person, he would greatly honor him and do him a considerable favor; the more so in proportion as the eminence of the office exceeds him. In this fashion Paul praises the gratuity of the office confided to himself: <span style="font-weight: bold">To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace.</span> He calls himself the <span style="font-weight: bold">least</span>, not because of the power granted him, but in recognition of his former state: “For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God” (1 Cor. 15:9). “The least shall become a thousand, and a little one a most strong nation” (Is. 60:22). This [duty was to be fulfilled] <span style="font-weight: bold">among the Gentiles</span>, that is, throughout the nations. “For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision wrought in me also among the Gentiles. And, when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision” (Gal. 2:8-9).

II, 4: <i>Deus autem qui dives est in misericordia</i>, et cetera. Rom. II, 4: <i>an divitias bonitatis eius, et patientiae, et longanimitatis contemnis?</i> et cetera. Rom. X, 12: <i>dives in omnes qui invocant illum</i>. Quasi dicat: divitiae istae vere investigabiles sunt, quia tanta est misericordia eius, quod intelligi vel investigari non possit. Is. XXXIII, 6: <i>divitiae salutis sapientia, et scientia, timor domini ipse thesaurus eius</i>, scilicet Christi, quia in Christo abundantissime fuit timor domini. Is. XI, 3: <i>replebit eum spiritus timoris domini</i>.
          <td>Regarding the first he says <span style="font-weight: bold">to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ,</span> as if to assert: To proclaim the good is the grace given me. “Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel” (I Cor. 1: 17). “Woe unto me if I preach not the gospel” (I Cor. 9:16). This good is <span style="font-weight: bold">the unsearchable riches of Christ</span> which are true wealth. “God who is rich in mercy... hath quickened us together in Christ” (Eph. 2:4); “Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering?” (Rom. 2:4); “The same is Lord over all, rich unto all that call upon him” (Rom. 10:12). These riches are unsearchable indeed, he affirms, since they are as great as his mercy which can be neither understood nor analyzed. “Riches of salvation, wisdom and knowledge: the fear of the Lord is his treasure” (Is. 33:6), referring to Christ since reverence of the Lord found its most plentiful expression in Christ. “And he shall be filled with the spirit of the fear of the Lord” (Is. 11:3).

Nam per creaturas, in quibus relucet vestigium creatoris, perveniri non potest ad perfectam eius cognitionem. Huiusmodi autem divitias stupens admiratur apostolus, dicens, Rom. XI, 33, <i>o altitudo divitiarum sapientiae et scientiae Dei, quam</i>, et cetera. Eccli. I, 3: <i>sapientiam Dei praecedentem omnia quis investigabit?</i>
          <td>In Christ “are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Col. 2:3). They are unsearchable because Christ’s wisdom and knowledge cannot be analyzed. “Peradventure thou wilt comprehend the steps of God, and wilt find out the Almighty perfectly?” (Job 11:7).

Eccli. XXIV, 45: <i>illuminabo omnes sperantes in domino</i>. Act. c. IX, 15: <i>vas electionis est</i>, et cetera. Matth. V, v. 14: <i>vos estis lux mundi</i>. Illuminare, inquam, quantum in me est omnes, scilicet credere volentes. I Tim. II, 4: <i>qui omnes homines vult salvos fieri, et ad agnitionem veritatis venire</i>. Ad hoc scilicet ut intelligant <i>quae sit dispensatio sacramenti</i>, quia nihil valent ista nisi dispensentur; quasi dicat: de hoc illuminabo, scilicet quam mirabilis et ex quanta dilectione sit facta adimpletio arcanae redemptionis.

          <td>Concerning the second—to make known the salvation which comes from Christ to those who believe—he says <span style="font-weight: bold">to enlighten all men</span>, not only the Jews, but the Gentiles as well, through preaching and miracles. I will enlighten all that hope in the Lord” (Ecclus. 24:45). “This man is to me a vessel of election, to carry my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel” (Ac. 9:15); “You are the light of the world” (Mt. 5:14). <span style="font-weight: bold">To enlighten</span>, I say, insofar as I can, all who want to believe. For God “will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth” (1 Tim. 2:4) in order that they might understand <span style="font-weight: bold">what is the dispensation of the mystery</span>. For these [mysteries] would be of no use if they were not imparted [to men]. As if he claimed: I shall enlighten men on how awe-inspiring the mystery of our redemption is, and from what an immense love it was accomplished. Inexhaustible riches of this sort are imparted to you through Christ.

Sed tamen ibi quaedam sunt abscondita, quaedam manifesta. Nam calor est manifeste in igne; aliquorum vero ratio, quae occulto modo producit, latet in eo.

          <td>Since God accomplished by himself the mystery of buman redemption, this mystery is hidden in him alone. Thus he states that it is <span style="font-weight: bold">hidden from eternity in God</span>, known to him only. Yet, to seek out the secrets of the First Cause is the greatest [wisdom]: “We speak wisdom among the perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought. But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world” (1 Cor. 2:6-7). He, I say, <span style="font-weight: bold">who created all things.</span>

But this is not in accord with Augustine’s thought. Here it could be asked whether the angels knew of the mystery of the Incarnation from the beginning of the world. The Teacher replies that it was known to the higher angels but not the lower ones. So the lower angels ask: “Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bosra?” (Is. 63:1). This opinion contradicts that of Blessed Dionysius who sees in the Holy Scriptures two questions asked by the angels about Christ.</a> <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote24',%20WPFootnote24%20)"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    </script>The first is from Psalm 23 (8): “Who is this King of Glory?” and the other is from Isaias 63 (1): Who is this that cometh from Edom?” According to Dionysius, the first is asked by the lower angels and the second by the higher. He bases this on the fact that God does not reply to the first, but someone else says: “The Lord of hosts, he is the King of Glory” (Ps. 23:10). Whereas the second is answered by God immediately: I, that speak justice and am a defender to save” (Is. 63:1). Hence, Dionysius prefers to say that both were ignorant of some [aspects of the mystery] and knew others. From the beginning all knew the mystery of the Incarnation in a general fashion, but as time passedor in the temporal process—they learned its detailed intelligible patterns when they were explicated in external events.

The rank of Powers is ordered to check any hindrances to salvation, while the rank of Principalities takes the lead and gives commands that [salvation] might be carried into effect properly. The regulative function of the Principality rank is evident from that text of Psalm 67 (26-28): “Princes went before joined with singers... The princes of Juda are their leaders.” The repressive function of the Powers is clear in Romans 13 (3-4): “Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good; and thou shalt have praise from the same. For he is God’s minister to thee, for good. But, if thou do that which is evil, fear; for he beareth not the sword in vain.

Et ideo Angeli non cognoscunt eas in seipsis, nec etiam in Deo, sed cognoscunt eas secundum quod in effectibus explicantur. Cum igitur rationes pertinentes ad multiformem sapientiam Dei, sint huiusmodi, scilicet in solo Deo absconditae, et postmodum in istis forinsecis effectibus explicatae, manifestum est, quod Angeli eas, nec in seipsis, nec in ipso verbo, nec etiam ab apostolis, nec a viatoribus aliis cognoverunt; sed in ipsis apostolis explicatas, prius in mente divina latentes, cognoverunt. Sicut domus quae est in mente artificis, vel conceptu de domo facienda, nullus scire potest quamdiu latet in mente, nisi solum ille qui solus illabitur animabus, scilicet Deus; sed postquam conceptus est iam in effectu extrinseco explicatus, quia domus iam facta est; sic aliquis de domo iam facta, quae prius latebat in mente artificis, edocetur, non autem edocetur per domum, sed in domo.
          <td>Further, there exist certain intelligible patterns [operative in] the mysteries of grace which transcend the whole of creation. These intelligible patterns are not impressed on the angelic minds but are bidden in God alone. Thus the angels do not grasp them in themselves, nor even in God, but only as they unfold in the events [which the mysteries] effect. Now, the intelligible patterns relative to God’s manifold wisdom belong to this category. They are hidden in God and gradually unfold in external effects. Clearly, therefore, the angels will understand them neither in themselves, nor in the Word, nor by the Apostles or any other wayfarer. Rather, they know [the mysteries of grace] hidden in the Divine Mind as they unfold in the Apostles themselves. This is like the case of a house, or the concept of a house to be built, in the mind of an architect. As long as it remains in his mind it can be known to no one—except God who alone penetrates into human souls. However, once the concepts are realized externally in the construction, in the house after it is built, anyone can learn from the building what previously was concealed in the architect’s mind. Yet, they are not taught by the house but in the house.

LXIII, v. 1: <i>quis est iste, qui venit de Edom?</i> et cetera.

Therefore, whoever stimulates another to some vital act, whether it be to good activity, to understanding, to willing or loving, can be given the name of father. “For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers” (1 Cor. 4:15). Likewise, in the hierarchical acts by which one angel illumines, perfects, and purifies another, it is evident that that angel is the father of the other—just as a teacher is the father of his disciples.

Vivere autem secundum actum est, quando exercet quis opera vitae in actu. Sic autem non solum qui dat potentiam vitae, pater est eius cui dat; sed qui dat actum vitae, ille etiam pater dici potest. Quicumque ergo inducit aliquem ad aliquem actum vitae, puta ad bene operandum, intelligendum, volendum, amandum, pater eius dici potest. I Cor. IV, 15: <i>nam si decem millia paedagogorum habeatis in Christo, sed non multos patres</i>, et cetera.

          <td>Some doubt that the fatherhood in heaven and on earth is derived from the paternity which exists in the Divinity. It seems not to be, for we give names in accordance with our knowledge of the reality named.

Aut inquantum est manifestativum quidditatis rei nominatae exterius, et sic est prius in Deo.

          <td>I reply and state that the name of anything we name can be taken in two ways. In one it is expressive or symbolic of an intellectual concept, since words are the marks or signs of the impressions or concepts that are in the soul. In this perspective a name refers to creatures more than to God. However, in the second [the name] discloses the quiddity of the external object which is named; thus it will refer more to God. Therefore, the word <span style="font-weight: bold">paternity,</span> when it signifies a concept formed by our intellect as it is naming a thing, will primarily be applicable to creatures instead of God since creatures are more known to us than God. But when it signifies the reality itself which has been named, then [this reality] is primarily in God rather than in us. For certainly all the power to procreate present in us is from God. So he says <span style="font-weight: bold">of whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named</span> as though to affirm: The fatherhood present in creatures is, as it were, nominal or vocal; but the divine fatherhood by which the Father communicates his whole nature to the Son without any imperfection, this is true paternity.

Ipse enim spiritus, qui roborat, est spiritus fortitudinis et est causa non deficiendi in tribulationibus, quem obtinemus per fidem quae est fortissima: quia fides est substantia rerum sperandarum, id est facit in nobis subsistere res sperandas. Unde I Petr. V, 9: <i>cui resistite fortes in fide</i>. Et ideo subiungit <i>habitare Christum per fidem</i>, et hoc <i>in cordibus vestris</i>. I Petr.

          <td>Inserted in the above is the phrase <span style="font-weight: bold">by his Spirit</span> indicating through whom petitions are granted. The Spirit himself fortifies, he is the Spirit of fortitude, and is the source of our not yielding under sufferings. We receive him through a faith which is most strong because it is the substance of the realities we hope for—that is, it makes these desired realities exist within us. Whence I Peter 5 (9) [concerning the devil]: “Whom resist ye, strong in faith.” And Paul adds <span style="font-weight: bold">that Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts</span>. “Sanctify the Lord Christ in, your hearts” (1 Pet. 3:15).

Charity never falleth away” (1 Cor. 13:7-8). “For love is strong as death...” (Cant. 8:6). A tree without roots, or a house lacking a foundation are destroyed easily. In a similar manner, a spiritual edifice not rooted and founded in charity cannot last.

Such comprehension is common to all his saints; so he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">with all the saints.</span> “This glory is to all his saints” (Ps. 149:9). “So run that you may apprehend [ <i>comprehendatis</i> ]” (1 Cor. 9:24). <img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0">

    </script>It follows that to know Christ’s love is to know all the mysteries of Christ’s Incarnation and our Redemption. These have poured out from the immense charity of God; a charity exceeding every created intelligence and the [combined] knowledge of all of them because it cannot be grasped in thought. Thus he says <span style="font-weight: bold">which surpasseth all</span> natural <span style="font-weight: bold">knowledge</span> and every created intellect: “The peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 4:7). For <span style="font-weight: bold">the charity of Christ</span> is [the manifestation of] what God the Father has accomplished through Christ: “God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself” (2 Cor. 5:19). <img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0">

For charity is broad in its diffusion: “And the Lord brought me forth into a broad place” (Ps. 17:20). Its <span style="font-weight: bold">length</span> is seen in its durability, never stopping, it begins in this life and is perfected in glory: “Charity never falleth away” (1 Cor. 13:8), and “Many waters cannot quench charity” (Cant. 8:7). Its <span style="font-weight: bold">height</span> is perceived in its motivation which is heavenly; God is not loved to obtain temporal advantages—which love would be sickly—but be is loved for his own sake alone. “Set thyself up on high and be glorious” (job 40:5). <span style="font-weight: bold">Depth</span> signifies the source of charity itself. For our love of God does not spring from ourselves, but from the Holy Spirit, as Romans 5 (5) mentions: “The charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.” Hence, for one person to possess a love which is lasting, extensive, sublime and deep, while another person does not, arises out of the depth of divine predestination. And “who has measured the depth of the abyss?” (Ecclus. 1:2). <img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0">

          <td>The knowledge of God is necessary for us both in the future life and in the present. For in the future we shall rejoice in our knowledge of God and in our perception of the humanity [the Son] assumed. “Now this is eternal life: that they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent” (Jn. 17:3). [Our Lord compared himself to a door; men will] “go in” to contemplate the divinity, and will “go out” in the contemplation of the humanity, “and shall find pastures” (Jn. 10:9). Faith inaugurates that future knowledge; it is “the substance of things hoped for” (Heb. 11:1), already making the realities we desire exist within us in an inchoate manner. For this reason our faith consists in the divinity and humanity of Christ. “For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ; and him crucified” (1 Cor. 2:2).

Iob XI, 7: <i>forsitan vestigia Dei comprehendes, et usque ad perfectum omnipotentem reperies?</i> Quasi dicat: non, quia sic posset eum perfecte cognoscere quantum cognoscibilis est. Et de hac cognitione non intelligitur quod dicitur <i>ut possitis comprehendere</i>, sed<br>
          secundo modo. Et est una de tribus dotibus, et de hac loquitur apostolus, cum dicit <i>ut possitis comprehendere</i>, id est Deum habere praesentem et praesentialiter cognoscere. Phil. c. III, 12: <i>sequor autem si quomodo comprehendam, in quo</i>, et cetera. Et haec comprehensio est communis omnibus sanctis eius. Ideo subdit <i>cum omnibus sanctis</i>. Ps. CXLIX, 9: <i>gloria haec est omnibus sanctis eius</i>. Talibus autem dicitur illud I Cor. IX, 24: <i>sic currite ut comprehendatis</i>, et cetera. <i>Quae sit latitudo</i>, et cetera.

No created intellect can comprehend God in the first manner. “Peradventure thou wilt comprehend the steps of God, and wilt find out the Almighty perfectly?” (Job 11:7). The answer implied is, No. For one could know him perfectly to the extent that [one knew all] that could be known about him. And this type of knowledge is not referred to in <span style="font-weight: bold">that you may comprehend</span>, but rather the second kind. This latter is one of the three dowries,

Profundior Inferno est, et unde cognosces? Longior terra mensura eius, et latior mari</i>. Ex quo videtur quod Iob ostendat eum esse comprehensibilem, attribuens ei quadruplicem differentiam dimensionum. His enim verbis alludens apostolus dicit <i>ut possitis comprehendere, quae sit latitudo</i>, etc.; quasi dicat: habeatis tantam fidem et charitatem, ut possitis tandem comprehendere quod comprehensibile est. Et hoc modo exponit Dionysius.
          <td>Note that the words <span style="font-weight: bold">what is the breadth and length and height and depth</span> seem to owe their origin to the passage in Job 11 (7-9). “Peradventure,” he says, “thou wilt comprehend the steps of God?” As if he stated that God is incomprehensible. Then he gives the reason for this incomprehensibility by saying: “He is higher than the heaven, and what wilt thou do? He is deeper than hell, and how wilt thou know? The measure of him is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.” Yet from this it appears that Job, in attributing the four different dimensions to him, shows that he is comprehensible. Alluding to these words the Apostle asserts that you may <span style="font-weight: bold">be able to comprehend what is the breadth and length and height and depth;</span> as though he said: May you possess sufficient faith and charity that you might comprehend him to the extent that he is able to be comprehended. Dionysius explains the text in this way.

          <td>Non est tamen aliquo modo intelligendum has dimensiones corporaliter esse in Deo, quia <i>spiritus est Deus</i>, ut dicitur Io. IV, 24. Sunt tamen in Deo metaphorice. Unde per latitudinem designatur dimensio seu extensio virtutis, et sapientiae divinae super omnia. Eccli. I, 10: <i>effudit illam</i>, scilicet sapientiam, <i>super omnia opera sua</i>. Per longitudinem designatur aeterna eius duratio. Ps. ci, 13: <i>tu autem, domine, in aeternum permanes</i>, et cetera. Ps. XCII, 5: <i>domum tuam, domine, decet sanctitudo in longitudinem dierum</i>. Per sublimitatem vel celsitudinem vero, perfectio et nobilitas naturae eius, quae in infinitum excedit creaturam. Ps.

          <td>Under no pretext should these dimensions be conceived as physically applicable to God, “God is spirit” (Jn. 4:24). They are in God metaphorically. <span style="font-weight: bold">Breadth</span> designates the dimension or extension of his power and divine wisdom over all being. “And he poured her out,” namely wisdom, “upon all his works” (Ecclus. 1:10). By <span style="font-weight: bold">length</span> his eternal duration is signified: “But thou, O Lord, endurest forever” (Ps. 101:13), and “holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, unto length of days” (Ps. 92:5). <span style="font-weight: bold">Height</span> or loftiness denotes the perfection and nobility of his nature which infinitely exceeds all creation: “The Lord is high above all nations: and his glory above the heavens” (Ps. 112:4). In <span style="font-weight: bold">depth</span> the incomprehensibility of his wisdom is intimated: “It is a great depth,” this divine wisdom, “who shall find it out?” (Eccl. 7:25). Clearly, therefore, the fulfillment of our faith and charity is to arrive at a perfect knowledge of the faith, by it we shall know, to the degree we can attain to it, the infinite extent of his power, the unbounded eternity of his duration, the loftiness of his most perfect nature, and the incomprehensibility and depth of his wisdom.

He was born out of charity: “For his exceeding charity wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins, bath quickened us together in Christ” (Eph. 2:4-5). That he died also sprang from charity: “Greater love than this no man bath, that a man lay down his life for his friends” (Jn. 15:13). And “Christ also bath loved us and bath delivered hftnself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God” (Eph. 5:2). On this account St. Gregory exclaimed: “O the incalculable love of your charity!

Cant. ult.: <i>aquae multae non potuerunt extinguere charitatem. Sublimitas</i> autem eius attenditur quantum ad intentionem caelestium, ut scilicet Deus non diligatur propter temporalia, quia huiusmodi charitas esset infirma, sed ut diligatur propter se tantum. Iob XL, v. 5: <i>in sublime erigere, et esto gloriosus. Profundum</i> vero attenditur quantum ad originem ipsius charitatis. Nam hoc quod Deum diligimus, non est ex nobis, sed a spiritu sancto, quia, ut dicitur Rom. V, 5, <i>charitas Dei diffusa est in cordibus nostris per spiritum sanctum</i>, et cetera. Hoc ergo quod unus habet charitatem longam, latam, sublimem et profundam, et alius non, venit ex profundo divinae praedestinationis. Eccli. I, 2: <i>profundum abyssi quis dimensus est</i>.

          <td>Ergo, <i>ut possitis comprehendere</i>, id est perfecte consequi cum omnibus sanctis, <i>quae sit latitudo</i>, ut extendatur charitas vestra usque ad inimicos, <i>quae sit longitudo</i>, ut scilicet numquam deficiat, <i>quae sit sublimitas</i>, ut scilicet propter seipsum Deus diligatur, et <i>quid sit profundum</i>, scilicet praedestinationis, et cetera.
          <td>Thus <span style="font-weight: bold">you may be able to comprehend</span>, in the sense of perfectly attaining to, <span style="font-weight: bold">with all the saints, what is the breadth</span> with which your charity should extend even to enemies, and what is the <span style="font-weight: bold">length</span> during which it never ceases, and its height in loving God for his own sake, and the <span style="font-weight: bold">depth</span> of the divine predestination [from which it springs].
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sciendum est autem hic quod Christus, in cuius potestate fuit eligere genus mortis quod vellet, quia ex charitate mortem subiit, elegit mortem crucis, in qua praedictae quatuor dimensiones sunt. Ibi est <i>latitudo</i>, scilicet in ligno transverso, cui affixae sunt manus, quia opera nostra debent per charitatem dilatari usque ad inimicos. Ps. XVII, 20: <i>eduxit me in latitudinem dominus</i>. Ibi est <i>longitudo</i> in ligno erecto, cui innititur totum corpus, quia charitas debet esse perseverativa, quae sustinet et salvat hominem. Matth. X, 22: <i>qui autem perseveraverit usque in finem, hic salvus erit</i>. Ibi est <i>sublimitas</i> in ligno superiori, cui caput inhaeret, quia spes nostra debet elevari ad aeterna et divina. I Cor. XI, 3: <i>caput viri Christus est</i>. Ibi etiam est <i>profundum</i> in ligno quod latet sub terra et sustinet crucem, et tamen non videtur, quia profundum amoris divini sustinet nos, nec tamen videtur; quia ratio praedestinationis ut dictum est excedit intellectum nostrum.
          <td>At this point it should be realized that it was within Christ’s power to choose what type of death he wanted. And since he underwent death out of charity, he chose the death of the cross in which the aforesaid four dimensions are present. The cross-beam has <span style="font-weight: bold">breadth</span> and to it his hands were nailed because through charity our good works ought to stretch out even to adversaries: “The Lord brought me forth into a broad place” (Ps. 17:20). The trunk of the cross has <span style="font-weight: bold">length</span> against which the whole body leans since charity ought to be enduring, thus sustaining and saving man: “He that shall persevere unto the end, he shall be saved” (Mt. 10:22). The projection of wood [above the cross-beam], against which the head is thrown back, has <span style="font-weight: bold">height</span> since our hope must rise toward the eternal and the divine: “The head of every man is Christ” (1 Cor. 11:3). The cross is braced by its <span style="font-weight: bold">depth</span> which lies concealed beneath the ground; it is not seen because the depth of the divine love which sustains us is not visible insofar as the plans of predestination, as was said above, are beyond our intelligence.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sic ergo debemus comprehendere virtutem charitatis nostrae et Christi, et adhuc scire charitatem Christi supereminentem scientiae, scilicet humanae, quia nullus potest scire quantum Christus dilexit nos, vel scire etiam charitatem scientiae Christi, quae habetur cum scientia Christi. Charitatem, dico, supereminentem, scilicet alii charitati, quae est sine scientia.
          <td>In this manner we should comprehend the power of our love, and of Christ’s, realizing that his surpasses human understanding. For no one could know how much Christ has loved us; nor can one know the charity of the knowledge of Christ, [that love] which is possessed with knowledge of Christ. I hold that such charity surpasses a love which is without knowledge.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed numquid est verum quod charitas quae est cum scientia superemineat charitati quae est sine scientia? Et videtur quod non, quia sic malus theologus esset supereminentioris charitatis quam sancta vetula. Respondeo. Dico quod hoc intelligitur de scientia afficiente: nam ex vi cognitionis inducitur ad magis diligendum, quia, quanto Deus magis cognoscitur, tanto et magis diligitur. Propter quod petebat Augustinus: <i>noverim te, noverim me</i>. Vel hoc dicitur propter quosdam qui habent zelum Dei, sed non secundum scientiam. Talium enim charitati supereminet charitas, cum habetur praedicta scientia Christi.
          <td>Is it not correct that a charity with knowledge is more eminent than,a charity without knowledge? It seems that it is not, for then a wicked theologian would have a charity of greater dignity than a holy old woman. I reply that what is discussed here is a knowledge which exerts its influence [on one’s life and conduct]. For the force of the knowledge stimulates one to love more since the more God is known, so much the more is he loved. For this reason Augustine used to ask: “That I may know You and know myself.”
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit <i>ut impleamini</i>, etc., ponit cognitionis divinae efficaciam, dicens <i>ut impleamini in omnem plenitudinem Dei</i>, id est ut habeatis perfectam participationem omnium donorum Dei, ut scilicet hic habeatis plenitudinem virtutum, et postea beatitudinis, quae quidem efficit charitas. Eccli. XXIV, 26: <i>transite ad me, omnes qui concupiscitis me</i>, et cetera.
          <td>Next he speaks of the efficacy of a knowledge of the divine. <span style="font-weight: bold">That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God,</span> that is, that you might enjoy a perfect participation in all God’s gifts. In other words, that you might possess the fullness of the virtues here, and beatitude in the next life—charity accomplishes just that. “Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits” (Ecclus. 24-26).

But he has done this in us by his power, and it was accomplished in the Incarnation of his Son. “That through this you may be made partakers of the divine nature” (2 Pet. 1:4). Concerning these matters Ecclesiasticus 18 (2-4) says: “Who is able to declare his works? For who shall search out his glorious acts? And who shall shew forth the power of his majesty?

For, as is mentioned below: &#8220;To everyone of us is given grace, according to the measure of the giving of Christ... he gave some apostles, and some prophets...&#8221; (Eph. 4:7, 11).

<br>Secondly, he explains what that mystery is (3:6).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Circa cognitionem suam tria facit.

<br>Thirdly, it is eminent (3:5).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Certa quidem est, quia non est per humanam industriam, nec per humanam intentionem, quae falli potest, Sap. IX, 14: <I>cogitationes enim mortalium timidae, et incertae providentiae nostrae</I>, sed per legem divinam quae certissima est. Et ideo dicit <I>quoniam secundum revelationem</I>, et cetera. Gal. I, v. 12: <I>neque enim ego ab homine accepi illud, neque didici; sed per revelationem Iesu Christi</I>. II Cor. III, 18: <I>nos vero revelata facie gloriam domini speculantes</I>, et cetera.
<td>Certain it is indeed, for he did not acquire it through human effort or human thought, which can err: &#8220;The thoughts of mortal men are timid, and our counsels uncertain&#8221; (Wis.9:14). Instead it is through the divine law which is most certain. Hence he says <span style="font-weight: bold">according to revelation the mystery has been made known to me</span>. &#8220;For neither did I receive it of man; nor did I learn it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ&#8221; (Gal. 1: 12). &#8220;We all, beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same image (2 Cor. 3:18).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Item plena est, quia perfecte revelatum est mihi, et committo vestro iudicio, quia ego in verbis paucis hoc expressi, in quibus cognoscere potestis quod perfectam cognitionem habeam de mysteriis fidei.

IV, 11: <I>favus distillans labia tua</I>, et cetera. Labium quidem breve quid est. Et sic labia doctoris sunt favus distillans, quando brevibus et paucis verbis multa et magna insinuat. Sed attende, ut dicit Augustinus, quod debet intendere hoc doctor, quod scilicet intelligatur. Et quamdiu ad hoc laborat, verba sua non sunt superflua, sed si postquam intelligitur, eis immoratur, superflua sunt eius verba. Dicit autem <I>prudentiam meam</I>, secundum illud Prov. IX, 10: <I>scientia sanctorum prudentia</I>. Quae quidem non est mundana sed divina et caelestis, propter quod dicit <I>in mysterio Christi</I>.
<td>Moreover, it is a full [knowledge] since it is revealed perfectly to me, and I entrust it to your judgment. I write of it in few words, in which you can recognize that I enjoy a perfect knowledge of the mysteries of faith. And in regard to this he says as <span style="font-weight: bold">I have written above in a few words </span>clearly, that <span style="font-weight: bold">as you are reading, you may understand. </span>&#8220;Thy lips... are as a dropping honeycomb&#8221; (Cant. 4:11). Lips are small; and those of a doctor are as &#8220;a dropping honeycomb&#8221; when he conveys many and profound thoughts in a few short words. Nevertheless, note that Augustine remarks <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote5', WPFootnote5 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote5" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote5 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote5\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  how a doctor should aim at being understood. As long as he strives for this his words are not superfluous, but if he remains on a point after he is understood he wastes his words.

<td>It is also eminent since it was revealed to the Apostles alone. Hence he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">which in other generations was not known</span>.

Et tunc est sensus, <I>quod aliis generationibus</I>, id est temporibus, <I>non est agnitum filiis hominum</I>, id est rationalibus creaturis, scilicet nec hominibus, nec Angelis. Matth.

<td><span style="font-weight: bold">Other generations</span> admits of a twofold explanation. In one, by generations the times of the generations are understood, as in Psalm 144 (13): &#8220;Thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.&#8221; Then the meaning is which in other generations, that is, times, [the mystery] was not known to the sons of men, to no rational creature, neither to men nor to angels. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote8', WPFootnote8 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote8" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote8 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote8\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  &#8220;Thou has hid these things from the wise and the prudent, and hast revealed them to little ones&#8221; (Mt. 11:25). <span style="font-weight: bold">As it is now revealed to his holy Apostles and prophets in the Spirit</span>, to them, namely, who interpret the Scriptures and explain the Law in the spirit of the New Testament. &#8220;To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to the rest in parables&#8221; (Lk. 8:10). &#8220;And turning to his disciples he said: Blessed are the eyes that see the things which you see. For I say to you that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things that you see and have not seen them&#8221; (Lk. 10:23-24).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Alio modo potest exponi ut per generationes accipiantur homines generati, secundum illud Matth.

<td>Another interpretation takes <span style="font-weight: bold">generations</span> in the sense of human generations, as in Matthew 23 (36): &#8220;All these things shall come upon this generation.&#8221; Then the meaning is <span style="font-weight: bold">which in other generations was not known </span>to those men, that is, who were born in the preceding generations. The rest [is interpreted] as above. &#8220;Who hath believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?&#8221; (Is. 53:1).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Sed hoc quidem sacramentum fidei revelatum est aliquibus patribus veteris testamenti, secundum illud Io.

Sed eis quidem revelatum est in quadam generalitate, apostolis vero clare et perfecte. Et hoc propter tria. Primo quia ipsi apostoli habuerunt revelationem immediate a filio Dei, secundum illud Io. I, 18: <I>unigenitus filius qui est in sinu patris, ipse enarravit</I>. Prophetae vero et patres veteris testamenti, ipsi edocti sunt per Angelos, vel per aliquas similitudines. Unde dicitur Is. VI, 6: <I>volavit ad me unus de Seraphim, et in manu eius calculus, quem</I>, et cetera. Et ideo ipsi apostoli clarius acceperunt.<br>secundo, quia non in figuris et in aenigmatibus, sicut prophetae, viderunt, sed revelata facie gloriam domini speculantes. Lc. X, 23: <I>beati oculi qui vident quae vos videtis</I>.<br>tertio, quia apostoli constituti fuerunt executores et dispensatores huius sacramenti, et ideo oportebat quod melius ipsi essent instructi quam alii. Io. IV, 38: <I>alii laboraverunt, et vos in labores eorum introistis</I>.
<td>But certainly this sacrament of faith <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote9', WPFootnote9 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote9" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote9 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote9\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  was revealed to some of the Old Testament fathers, as is implied in John 8 (56): &#8220;Abraham, your father, rejoiced that he might see my day; he saw it and was glad.&#8221; And [it was also revealed] to the prophets, according to Joel 2 (28): &#8220;And it shall come to pass after this, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.&#8221; But it was revealed to them in certain generalities, whereas [it was disclosed] to the Apostles clearly and completely. Three reasons account for this. First, because the Apostles received the revelation immediately from the Son of God: &#8220;The only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him&#8221; (Jn. 1:18). The prophets and fathers of the Old Testament, on the other hand, were taught by angels, or through some similar imagery: &#8220;And one of the seraphims flew to me: and in his hand was a live coal which he had taken with the tongs off the altar&#8221; (Is. 6:6). Hence, the Apostles received it more clearly. Secondly, they did not see in symbols and riddles as the prophets did, but were given a plain view of the Lord&#8217;s glory: &#8220;Blessed are the eyes that see the things which you see&#8221; (Lk. 10:23). Thirdly, since the Apostles were meant to carry into effect and communicate this sacrament, it was necessary for them to be more instructed in it than others. &#8220;Others have labored; and you have entered into their labors&#8221; (Jn. 4:38).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Consequenter cum dicit <I>esse gentes</I>, etc., manifestat quid sit illud sacramentum. Circa quod sciendum est quod Iudaei triplicem praerogativam habebant respectu gentilium, scilicet promissionis haereditatis. Rom. c. IV, 13: <I>non enim per legem promissio Abrahae, aut semini eius, ut haeres esset mundi, sed per iustitiam fidei</I>. Ps. XV, 5: <I>dominus pars haereditatis meae</I>, et cetera. Item per specialem a gentibus aliis distinctionem et electionem. Deut. VII, 6: <I>te elegit dominus Deus tuus, ut sis ei populus peculiaris de cunctis populis qui sunt super terram</I>. Unde Ps. XCIX, 3: <I>nos autem populus eius et oves pascuae eius</I>. Cant. VI, 8: <I>una est columba mea, perfecta mea</I>, et cetera. Item per Christi promissionem. Gen. XII, 3: <I>in te benedicentur universae cognationes terrae</I>.
<td>Consequently, when he states <span style="font-weight: bold">that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, </span>he makes known what the sacrament is. In reference to it, it should be recognized that the Jews enjoyed three prerogatives with respect to the Gentiles. They had the promised inheritance: &#8220;For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world; but through the justice of faith&#8221; (Rom. 4:13); &#8220;The Lord is the portion of my inheritance&#8221; (Ps. 15:5). Another was their special election, they were set apart from the Gentiles: &#8220;The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be his peculiar people of all peoples that are upon the earth&#8221; (Deut. 7:6). &#8220;We are his people and the sheep of his pasture&#8221; (Ps. 99:3); &#8220;One is my dove: my perfect one is but one&#8221; (Cant. 6:8). Finally, they had the promise of a Christ: &#8220;In thee shall all the kindred of the earth be blessed&#8221; (Gen. 12:3).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Haec autem tria gentes non habebant. Supra II, 12: <I>qui eratis illo tempore sine Christo, alienati a conversatione Israel</I>. Sed ad haec tria recepti sunt per fidem. Primo quidem, quantum ad participationem haereditatis, et, quantum ad hoc, dicit <I>cohaeredes</I>, scilicet ipsis Iudaeis in haereditate caelesti. Matth. VIII, 11: <I>multi ab oriente et occidente venient, et recumbent cum Abraham, Isaac et Iacob in regno caelorum</I>, et cetera.<br>secundo ad speciale collegium fidelium, et, quantum ad hoc, dicit <I>et concorporales</I>, id est in unum corpus. Io. X, 16: <I>alias oves habeo quae non sunt ex hoc ovili</I>, id est gentes, <I>et illas oportet me adducere, et vocem meam audient, et fiet unum ovile et unus pastor</I>.<br>tertio, ad participationem gratiae repromissae, et quantum ad hoc dicit <I>et comparticipes</I>, scilicet promissionum quae factae sunt Abrahae. Rom. XV, 8: <I>dico autem Christum fuisse ministrum circumcisionis propter veritatem Dei ad confirmandas promissiones patrum, gentes autem super misericordia honorare Deum</I>.
<td>These three the Gentiles did not enjoy: &#8220;You were at that time without Christ, being aliens to Israel&#8217;s way of life&#8221; (Eph. 2:12 &#8216;). By faith, however, they have received them. First, they share in the inheritance; concerning this he says <span style="font-weight: bold">fellow heirs</span> with the Jews in the heavenly inheritance. &#8220;And I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven&#8221; (Mt. 8:11). Second, [they are admitted] to the chosen community of believers; thus he states <span style="font-weight: bold">of the same body, </span>that is, in one body. &#8220;And other sheep I have that are not of this fold,&#8221; namely, the Gentiles, &#8220;them also I must bring. And they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd&#8221; (Jn. 10:16). Third, [they are admitted] to a participation in the promised grace; he says they are <span style="font-weight: bold">co-partners of his promise</span>, the promises made to Abraham. &#8220;For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers; but that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy&#8221; (Rom. 15:8-9).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Et haec omnia consecutae sunt gentes non per Moysem, sed <I>in Christo</I>. Io. I, 17: <I>lex per Moysem data est, gratia et veritas per Iesum Christum facta est</I>. II Petr. I, 4: <I>per quem maxima et pretiosa nobis promissa donavit</I>, et cetera. Item, nec per impletionem legis, quia hoc est iugum quod <I>neque patres nostri, neque nos portare potuimus</I>, ut dicitur Act. XV, 10, sed <I>per Evangelium</I>, per quod omnes salvantur. Rom. I, 16: <I>non enim erubesco Evangelium, virtus enim Dei est in salutem omni credenti</I>. I Cor. XV, 1: <I>notum vobis facio Evangelium quod praedicavi vobis, quod et accepistis, in quo et statis, per quod et salvamini</I>.
<td>The Gentiles have acquired all this, not through Moses, but in Christ. &#8220;For the Law was given by Moses; grace and truth came by Jesus Christ&#8221; (Jn. 1:17), &#8220;by whom he hath given us most great and precious promises&#8221; (2 Pet. 1:4). Moreover, these did not come through fulfilling the law, whose burden &#8220;neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear&#8221; (Ac. 15: 10), but <span style="font-weight: bold">by the gospel</span> through which all men are saved. &#8220;For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first and to the Greek&#8221; (Rom. 1:16). &#8220;Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received and wherein you stand. By which also you are saved&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:1-2).

<td><blockquote>7 Of whom I am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which is given to me according to the operation of his power. 8 To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace, to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; 9 And to enlighten all men, that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God who created all things.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Postquam ostendit apostolus esse sibi gratiam dispensatam quantum ad mysteriorum divinorum cognitionem, hic ostendit hoc idem quantum ad ipsorum mysteriorum executionem. Et circa hoc duo facit.
<td>After the Apostle has discussed the grace given him relative to the knowledge of divine mysteries (3:3), he indicates the same with respect to carrying these mysteries themselves into effect. Concerning this he makes two points:
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td><p style=margin-left:.3in>Primo commemorat auxilium gratiae praestitum sibi ad exequendum;<br>secundo, ostendit sibi commissum officium ministerii, ibi <I>mihi omnium sanctorum minimo</I>, et cetera.
<td><p style=margin-left:.3in>First, he acknowledges the assistance of grace granted him to put them into practice.
<br>Secondly, he speaks of the ministerial duty confided to him (3:8).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Prima in duas.
<td>The first has two divisions:
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td><p style=margin-left:.3in>Primo tangit ministeriorum divinorum executionem;<br>secundo ostendit auxilium sibi datum ad exequendum, ibi <I>secundum donum gratiae</I>, et cetera.
<td><p style=margin-left:.3in>First, he briefly treats of putting divine mysteries into effect.
<br>Secondly, he shows how help has been given him (3:7b).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Executio autem divinorum sibi commissa est per modum ministerii, et quantum ad hoc dicit: dico quod hoc ministerium est mihi commissum, scilicet gentes esse cohaeredes per Evangelium, per quod gentes participes fiunt promissionis Dei in Christo Iesu, <I>cuius ego</I> Paulus <I>factus sum minister</I>, etc.; quasi dicat: non ego impleo vel exequor ut a me vel ut meum, sed sicut ministerium quod Dei est. Act. IX, 15: <I>vas electionis est mihi iste</I>, et cetera. Unde apostolus I Cor. IV, 1: <I>sic nos existimet homo ut ministros Christi et dispensatores mysteriorum Dei</I>.
<td>The realization of divine realities was committed to him by way of a ministry. He says in relation to this: I assert that this ministry has been entrusted to me, that the Gentiles are co-heirs by the Gospel and through it they share as well in God&#8217;s promise in Christ Jesus, <span style="font-weight: bold">of whom I am made a minister</span>. As though he stated: I do not fulfill or carry out [this mystery] as if it came from me or was mine, but as a ministry belonging to God. &#8216;Tor this man is to me a vessel of election, to carry my name before the Gentiles&#8221; (Act. 9:15). &#8220;Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and the dispensers of the mysteries of God&#8221; (I Cor. 4:1).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Deinde cum dicit <I>secundum donum gratiae</I>, etc., tangit auxilium sibi praestitum ad ministeriorum executionem. Huiusmodi autem auxilium duplex fuit. Unum quidem ipsa facultas exequendi, aliud ipsa operatio, sive actualitas. Facultatem autem dat Deus infundendo virtutem et gratiam, per quas efficitur homo potens et aptus ad operandum; sed ipsam operationem confert inquantum operatur in nobis interius movendo et instigando ad bonum. Et ideo hoc accipiens apostolus a Deo, dicit quantum ad primum: dico quod <I>factus sum minister</I>, sed certe non meis meritis, nec virtute propria, sed <I>secundum donum gratiae Dei quae data est mihi</I>, quia scilicet idoneus efficior ad executionem divinorum mysteriorum, qui fui prius persecutor. I Cor. XV. 10: <I>plus omnibus laboravi, non ego, sed gratia Dei mecum</I>. Quantum ad secundum dicit <I>secundum operationem</I>, quam Deus efficit, inquantum virtus eius operatur in nobis et velle et perficere pro bona voluntate.
<td>When he writes <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the gift of the grace of God </span>he touches on the aid granted him to carry out the mysteries. This type of assistance was twofold. One was the capacity to put them into effect, and another was the very actions or activities themselves. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote10', WPFootnote10 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote10" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote10 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote10\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  God bestows the capability by infusing the virtue and grace through which a man is able and fit for action; while he confers the action itself insofar as be moves us interiorly and spurs us on to good. Receiving both from God, the Apostle acknowledges the first in saying: <span style="font-weight: bold">I am made a minister</span>, certainly not on my own merits, nor by my own virtue, but <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the gift of the grace of God which is given to me</span>. For I was made worthy to realize the divine mysteries which previously I had persecuted. I have labored more abundantly than all they. Yet not I, but the grace of God with me&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:10). In reference to the second he states <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the operation </span>which God effects inasmuch as <span style="font-weight: bold">his power</span> causes us both to will and to act in accord with good will.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Potest autem hoc aliter exponi secundum Glossam, ut quod dictum est modo referatur ad praecedentia, scilicet dicatur quod esse gentes cohaeredes et concorporales, et comparticipes promissionis eius, scilicet Dei patris, hoc quidem donum dedit Deus gentibus in Christo, id est per Christum, et hoc secundum operationem virtutis eius, id est per hoc quod potenter operatus est, suscitando Christum a morte.
<td>This can be interpreted in another way according to a Gloss. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote11', WPFootnote11 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote11" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote11 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote11\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  What is said here refers to what immediately preceded (v. 6). For the pagans to have become co-heirs, and of the same body, and co-partners of God the Father&#8217;s promise-this is a gift God gave the Gentiles in Christ. That is, they come through Christ, <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the operation of his power </span>in that he has powerfully acted in raising Christ from the dead.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Consequenter cum dicit <I>mihi enim sanctorum minimo</I>, etc., ostendit officium commissum, cuius quidem commissionis gratia commendatur ex tribus.
<td>Next (v. 8), he speaks of the duty entrusted to him; the grace of such a commission has three qualities to recommend it:
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td><p style=margin-left:.3in>Primo quidem ex personae suae conditione;<br>secundo ex commissorum magnitudine, ibi <I>evangelizare investigabiles</I>, etc.;<br>tertio ex fructus utilitate, ibi <I>ut innotescat</I>, et cetera.
<td><p style=margin-left:.3in>First, the condition of the person himself [to whom it is entrusted].
<br>Secondly, the greatness of what is confided to him (3:8b).
<br>Thirdly, the good that results as its fruit (3:10 ff.).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Commendat igitur officium sibi commissum ex personae conditione. Si enim rex aliquis, aliquod quidem magnum officium alicui magno principi et excellenti committeret, non multum ei magnam gratiam faceret, quantum ad hunc magnum, si poneret in magno officio; sed si magnum et arduissimum officium alicui parvo committat, multum eum magnificat, et magnam gratiam facit ei, et tanto magis quanto officii excellentia excedit ipsum. Secundum ergo hunc modum Paulus gratiam sibi commissi officii commendat, dicens <I>mihi enim omnium sanctorum minimo data est gratia haec</I>. Et vocat se minimum, non ex potestate sibi commissa, sed ex consideratione status praeteriti. I Cor. XV, 9: <I>ego sum minimus apostolorum, qui non sum dignus vocari apostolus, quoniam persecutus sum Ecclesiam Dei</I>. Is. LX, 22: <I>minimus erit in mille, et parvulus in gentem fortissimam</I>. Et hoc <I>in gentibus</I>, id est inter gentes, Gal. II, 8-9: <I>qui enim operatus est Petro in apostolatum circumcisionis, operatus est et mihi inter gentes. Et cum cognovissent gratiam Dei, quae data est mihi inter gentes</I>, et cetera.
<td>The office confided to him is recommended from this person&#8217;s condition. For if some king entrusted an important office to a great and high-ranking prince, he would not be doing him a very great favor since he would be placing an important person in an important position. But if he entrusts a great and exceedingly difficult duty to an insignificant person, he would greatly honor him and do him a considerable favor; the more so in proportion as the eminence of the office exceeds him. In this fashion Paul praises the gratuity of the office confided to himself: <span style="font-weight: bold">To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace. </span>He calls himself the <span style="font-weight: bold">least</span>, not because of the power granted him, but in recognition of his former state: &#8220;For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:9). &#8220;The least shall become a thousand, and a little one a most strong nation&#8221; (Is. 60:22). This [duty was to be fulfilled] <span style="font-weight: bold">among the Gentiles</span>, that is, throughout the nations. &#8220;For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision wrought in me also among the Gentiles. And, when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision&#8221; (Gal. 2:8-9).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Secundo commendatur huiusmodi commissionis gratia ex officii magnitudine, quod est revelare et manifestare secreta Dei, quae sunt magna et occulta, puta, de magnitudine Christi et de salute fidelium facta per eum. De his autem duobus est totum Evangelium.
<td>In the second place (3:8b), the grace of his mission is commended by reason of the magnitude of his task: to reveal and clarify the great and hidden secrets of God. Think of the greatness of Christ and of the salvation of those who believe which he accomplished. The entire Gospel concerns these two.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Quantum ad primum dicit <I>evangelizare</I>, etc., quasi dicat: haec gratia data est mihi ut annuntiem bonum. I Cor. I, 17: <I>non misit me Christus baptizare, sed evangelizare</I>. Et ibidem IX, 16: <I>vae enim mihi si non evangelizavero</I>. Et bonum hoc, scilicet <I>investigabiles Christi divitias</I>, quae sunt verae divitiae. Supra c. II, 4: <I>Deus autem qui dives est in misericordia</I>, et cetera. Rom. II, 4: <I>an divitias bonitatis eius, et patientiae, et longanimitatis contemnis?</I> et cetera. Rom. X, 12: <I>dives in omnes qui invocant illum</I>. Quasi dicat: divitiae istae vere investigabiles sunt, quia tanta est misericordia eius, quod intelligi vel investigari non possit. Is. XXXIII, 6: <I>divitiae salutis sapientia, et scientia, timor domini ipse thesaurus eius</I>, scilicet Christi, quia in Christo abundantissime fuit timor domini. Is. XI, 3: <I>replebit eum spiritus timoris domini</I>.
<td>Regarding the first he says <span style="font-weight: bold">to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ, </span>as if to assert: To proclaim the good is the grace given me. &#8220;Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel&#8221; (I Cor. 1: 17). &#8220;Woe unto me if I preach not the gospel&#8221; (I Cor. 9:16). This good is <span style="font-weight: bold">the unsearchable riches of Christ </span>which are true wealth. &#8220;God who is rich in mercy... hath quickened us together in Christ&#8221; (Eph. 2:4); &#8220;Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering?&#8221; (Rom. 2:4); &#8220;The same is Lord over all, rich unto all that call upon him&#8221; (Rom. 10:12). These riches are unsearchable indeed, he affirms, since they are as great as his mercy which can be neither understood nor analyzed. &#8220;Riches of salvation, wisdom and knowledge: the fear of the Lord is his treasure&#8221; (Is. 33:6), referring to Christ since reverence of the Lord found its most plentiful expression in Christ. &#8220;And he shall be filled with the spirit of the fear of the Lord&#8221; (Is. 11:3).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>In Christo enim sunt omnes thesauri sapientiae et scientiae absconditi Col. II, 3, et haec sunt investigabiles, quia perfecte sapientia et scientia Christi investigari non possunt. Iob XI, 7: <I>reperies forsan vestigia Dei, et usque ad perfecte omnipotentem?</I> Quasi dicat: non. Nam per creaturas, in quibus relucet vestigium creatoris, perveniri non potest ad perfectam eius cognitionem. Huiusmodi autem divitias stupens admiratur apostolus, dicens, Rom. XI, 33, <I>o altitudo divitiarum sapientiae et scientiae Dei, quam</I>, et cetera. Eccli. I, 3: <I>sapientiam Dei praecedentem omnia quis investigabit?</I>
<td>In Christ &#8220;are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge&#8221; (Col. 2:3). They are unsearchable because Christ&#8217;s wisdom and knowledge cannot be analyzed. &#8220;Peradventure thou wilt comprehend the steps of God, and wilt find out the Almighty perfectly?&#8221; (Job 11:7). The implied answer is, No. For creatures, in whom a trace of their Creator is visible, <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote12', WPFootnote12 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote12" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote12 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote12\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  do not provide us with a perfect understanding of Him. Struck by the wonder of these riches, the Apostle exclaimed: &#8220;O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable his waysl&#8221; (Rom. 11:33). &#8220;Who hath searched out the wisdom of God that goeth before all things?&#8221; (Ecclus. 1:3).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Quantum ad secundum, id est ad manifestandam salutem fidelibus ex Christo provenientem, dicit <I>et illuminare omnes</I>, non solum Iudaeos, sed etiam gentiles per praedicationem et miracula. Eccli. XXIV, 45: <I>illuminabo omnes sperantes in domino</I>. Act. c. IX, 15: <I>vas electionis est</I>, et cetera. Matth. V, v. 14: <I>vos estis lux mundi</I>. Illuminare, inquam, quantum in me est omnes, scilicet credere volentes. I Tim. II, 4: <I>qui omnes homines vult salvos fieri, et ad agnitionem veritatis venire</I>. Ad hoc scilicet ut intelligant <I>quae sit dispensatio sacramenti</I>, quia nihil valent ista nisi dispensentur; quasi dicat: de hoc illuminabo, scilicet quam mirabilis et ex quanta dilectione sit facta adimpletio arcanae redemptionis. Huiusmodi autem divitiae investigabiles, per Christum vobis dispensatae sunt.
<td>Concerning the second&#8212;to make known the salvation which comes from Christ to those who believe&#8212;he says <span style="font-weight: bold">to enlighten all men</span>, not only the Jews, but the Gentiles as well, through preaching and miracles. I will enlighten all that hope in the Lord&#8221; (Ecclus. 24:45). &#8220;This man is to me a vessel of election, to carry my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel&#8221; (Ac. 9:15); &#8220;You are the light of the world&#8221; (Mt. 5:14). <span style="font-weight: bold">To enlighten</span>, I say, insofar as I can, all who want to believe. For God &#8220;will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth&#8221; (1 Tim. 2:4) in order that they might understand <span style="font-weight: bold">what is the dispensation of the mystery</span>. For these [mysteries] would be of no use if they were not imparted [to men]. As if he claimed: I shall enlighten men on how awe-inspiring the mystery of our redemption is, and from what an immense love it was accomplished. Inexhaustible riches of this sort are imparted to you through Christ.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Sed quia dici posset: istud quod dicis, etsi sit magnum, omnes tamen hoc sciunt; ideo ad hoc respondet apostolus dicens, quod non, quia <I>absconditi a saeculis</I>. Ubi sciendum est quod omnia quae sunt in effectu, latent virtute in suis causis, sicut in virtute solis continentur omnia quae sunt in generabilibus et corruptibilibus. Sed tamen ibi quaedam sunt abscondita, quaedam manifesta. Nam calor est manifeste in igne; aliquorum vero ratio, quae occulto modo producit, latet in eo. Deus autem est omnium rerum causa efficiens, sed producit quaedam, quorum ratio potest esse manifesta, illa scilicet quae mediantibus causis secundis producit. Aliqua vero sunt in eo abscondita, illa scilicet quae immediate per seipsum producit.
<td>Yet it might be objected: What you speak of is known to all, even if it is great. The Apostle gives a negative reply, <span style="font-weight: bold">it hath been hidden from eternity. </span>Here it should be noted how everything present in an effect is concealed in the power of its causes. For example, in the power of the sun is contained everything that exists among the realities which come into being and cease to be. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote13', WPFootnote13 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote13" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote13 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote13\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  Nevertheless, certain [effects] are hidden there, and others are evident. For instance, heat is evidently in fire while the intelligibility of other [effects], which it produces in a more hidden manner, are said to be concealed in it. Now God is the efficient cause of everything; be makes some things whose intelligibility is open [to investigation], namely, those created through the mediation of second causes. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote14', WPFootnote14 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote14" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote14 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote14\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  Other effects, however, which he immediately produces by himself are hidden in him.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Et quia sacramentum humanae redemptionis per seipsum operatus est Deus, ideo in eo solo hoc sacramentum est absconditum. Et hoc est quod dicit <I>absconditi a saeculis in Deo</I>, id est in sola notitia Dei. Investigare autem secreta primae causae maximum est. I Cor. II, 6: <I>sapientiam loquimur inter perfectos: sapientiam vero non huius saeculi, neque principum huius saeculi, qui destruuntur, sed loquimur Dei sapientiam in mysterio, quae abscondita est, quam praedestinavit Deus ante saecula. Qui</I>, inquam, <I>omnia creavit</I>.
<td>Since God accomplished by himself the mystery of buman redemption, this mystery is hidden in him alone. Thus he states that it is <span style="font-weight: bold">hidden from eternity in God</span>, known to him only. Yet, to seek out the secrets of the First Cause is the greatest [wisdom]: &#8220;We speak wisdom among the perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought. But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:6-7). He, I say, <span style="font-weight: bold">who created all things.

<td><blockquote>10 That the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to the principalities and powers in heavenly places through the church, 11 According to a pre-determining of the ages which he made in Christ Jesus our Lord; 12 In whom we have assurance and access with confidence by the faith of him.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Posita dignitate officii ex magnitudine commissorum, hic commendat apostolus officii dignitatem ex utilitate effectus, quae quidem est revelatio magnarum rerum magnis personis. Sunt autem circa hoc tria consideranda.
<td>Once he has set forth the dignity of his office that arises from the magnitude of what it entrusts to him (3:8), the Apostle here gives evidence of his office&#8217;s worth from the utility of its effect. This consists in the revelation of great realities to eminent persons. Three points are to be considered regarding this:
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td><p style=margin-left:.3in>Primo quidem quibus sit revelatum, et quantum ad hoc dicit <I>ut innotescat principatibus</I>, etc.;<br>secundo per quem reveletur, quia <I>per Ecclesiam</I>;<br>tertio quid reveletur, quia <I>multiformis sapientia Dei</I>.
<td><p style=margin-left:.3in>First, to whom the revelation is directed (3:10a).
<br>Secondly, through whom it is made known, at through the church (3:10b).
<br>Thirdly, what is revealed, namely, the manifold wisdom of God (3:10a).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Ad cuius quidem sapientiae descriptionem quatuor tangit apostolus.
<td>The Apostle touches on four points in his description of this wisdom:
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td><p style=margin-left:.3in>Primo eius multiplicitatem, ibi <I>multiformis sapientia Dei</I>;<br>secundo modum multiplicitatis, ibi <I>praefinitionem saeculorum</I>;<br>tertio multiplicitatis auctoritatem; unde subdit <I>quam fecit in Christo Iesu domino nostro</I>;<BR>quarto auctoritatis effectum, ibi <I>in quo habemus fiduciam et accessum</I>.
<td><p style=margin-left:.3in>First, its many facets (3:10).
<br>Secondly, how it is so manifold (3:11a).
<br>Thirdly, the source of this multiplicity (3:11b).
<br>Fourthly, the effect of its coming from that source (3:12).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Est ergo sapientia, quae revelatur, <I>multiformis</I>, et haec quidem multiformitas tangitur Iob XI, 5: <I>utinam Deus loqueretur tecum et aperiret labia sua tibi, ut ostenderet tibi secreta sapientiae, et quam multiplex sit lex eius</I>, et cetera. Sap. VII, 22: <I>est enim in illa</I>, scilicet sapientia divina, <I>spiritus intelligentiae, sanctus, unicus et multiplex</I>, et cetera. Multiplex scilicet in effectibus; unicus, scilicet in essentia.
<td>The wisdom which is revealed is <span style="font-weight: bold">manifold</span>. Job 11 (5) briefly speaks of this diversity: &#8220;And I wish that God would speak with thee, and would open his lips to thee, that he might shew thee the secrets of wisdom, and that his law is manifold.&#8221; &#8220;For in her,&#8221; namely, divine wisdom, &#8220;is the spirit of understanding: holy, one, manifold&#8221; (Wis. 7:22). Manifold that is, in her effects, yet one in her essence.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Modus autem multiplicitatis revelatae scientiae est <I>secundum praefinitionem saeculorum</I>, id est distinctionem et determinationem diversorum temporum. Deus enim ordinat alia esse in uno tempore, alia in alio, et secundum hoc huiusmodi sapientia multiformis dicitur secundum praefinitionem saeculorum, quia diversa tempora diversis ornat effectibus.
<td>The way this revealed knowledge is many-sided is <span style="font-weight: bold">according to a pre-determining of the ages</span>, <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote15', WPFootnote15 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote15" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote15 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote15\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  meaning the differentiation and limitation of the various times. For God plans something to exist at one time, and others at another time. In this fashion such wisdom is referred to as <span style="font-weight: bold">manifold according to a pre-determining of the </span>ages since he provides different times with different events.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Auctor autem huius multiplicitatis est Christus; unde dicit <I>quam fecit</I> Deus <I>in Christo Iesu domino nostro</I>, id est per Christum. Ipse enim mutat tempora et statum eorum. Hebr. I, 1: <I>multifarie multisque modis</I>, etc., <I>per quem fecit et saecula</I>. Potest autem hoc quod dicit <I>quam fecit</I>, etc., referri vel ad aeternam praedestinationem: nam ipsam fecit pater in filio suo. Supra I, 4: <I>elegit nos in ipso ante mundi constitutionem, ut essemus sancti</I>. Ipse enim filius est sapientia patris, nihil autem diffinit, vel praeordinat aliquid, nisi per sapientiam. Vel potest referri ad praedestinationis aeternae completionem, quam Deus pater per filium consummavit. I Cor. X, 11: <I>in quos fines saeculorum devenerunt</I>, supple sumus.
<td>The source of this multiplicity is Christ; hence he says <span style="font-weight: bold">which God made in Christ Jesus our Lord, </span>that is, through Christ. For he himself alters times and their states: &#8220;God, who, at sundry times and in diverse manners, spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all in these days hath spoken to, us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the ages&#8221; (Heb. 1:1-2).  <span style="font-weight: bold">Which he made in Christ Jesus </span>may refer to eternal predestination since the Father accomplishes this in his Son: &#8220;He chose us in him [Christ] before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy&#8221; (Eph. 1:4). For the Son himself is the wisdom of the Father, and nothing is determined or foreordained except through wisdom. Or <span style="font-weight: bold">which he made in Christ Jesus</span> may refer to the fulfillment of eternal predestination which God the Father brings to completion through the Son. We are those &#8220;upon whom the ends of the ages have come&#8221; (1 Cor. 10:11).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Effectus autem auctoris est magnitudo fructus, qui nobis a Christo provenit, quod ponitur, cum dicit <I>in quo habemus fiduciam</I>, et cetera. Circa quod duo facit.
<td>The effect of this source [<i>auctoris</i>] consists in a great fruit which comes to us from Christ. This is expressed at in whom we have assurance... Concerning this he does two things:
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td><p style=margin-left:.3in>Primo ponit bona quae recipimus;<br>secundo appropriatum per quod recipimus, ibi <I>per fidem eius</I>.
<td><p style=margin-left:.3in>First, he puts down the blessings we receive.
<br>Secondly, he designates through what we receive them (3:12b).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Bona autem quae recipimus, sunt duo: unum quod pertinet ad spem obtinendi, et quantum ad hoc dicit <I>in quo</I>, scilicet Christo, <I>habemus fiduciam</I>, scilicet veniendi ad caelum et aeternam haereditatem. Io. XVI, 33: <I>confidite, ego vici mundum</I>. II Cor. III, 4: <I>fiduciam talem habemus per Christum ad Deum</I>. Aliud bonum pertinet ad obtinendi facultatem, et quantum ad hoc dicit <I>et accessum in confidentia</I>, scilicet habemus. Hebr. IV, v. 16: <I>adeamus cum fiducia ad thronum gloriae eius</I>. Ier. III, 19: <I>patrem vocabis me, et post me ingredi non cessabis</I>. Rom. V, 2: <I>per quem accessum habemus per fidem in gratia ista, in qua stamus, et gloriamur in spe gloriae filiorum Dei</I>.
<td>There are two goods which we obtain. One pertains to the hope of attaining [to our reward]; and in reference to this he says <span style="font-weight: bold">in whom</span>, namely Christ, <span style="font-weight: bold">we have assurance</span> of arriving at heaven and our eternal inheritance. &#8220;Have confidence, I have overcome the world&#8221; (Jn. 16:33). &#8220;Such assurance we have, through Christ, towards God&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:4). The second good pertains to the power of attaining to [our reward]; in respect to which he states that we have access with confidence. &#8220;Let us go, therefore, with confidence to the throne of his glory&#8221; (Heb. 4:16). <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote16', WPFootnote16 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote16" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote16 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote16\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  &#8220;Thou shalt call me father and shall not cease to walk after me&#8221; (Jer. 3:19). &#8220;By whom [Christ] also we have access through faith into this grace wherein we stand; and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God&#8221; (Rom. 5:2).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Per quid autem haec dentur nobis, subdit, dicens <I>per fidem eius</I>, scilicet Christi. Rom. V, 1: <I>iustificati ex fide pacem habemus ad Deum per dominum nostrum Iesum Christum</I>.
<td>The means by which these are given us is <span style="font-weight: bold">by the faith of him, </span>namely, of Christ. &#8220;Being justified, therefore, by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; (Rom. 5: 1).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Ut ergo breviter comprehendamus, dico quod revelata est sapientia Dei multiformis varietatis, secundum distinctionem et praefinitionem saeculorum, quae dedit nobis fiduciam et accessum ad patrem per fidem eius.
<td>That we might summarize [what has been said above] briefly, I assert that God&#8217;s many-faceted wisdom is revealed in the differentiation and pre-determining of the ages, which gives us assurance and access to the Father by faith in him.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Quibus autem revelata sit ista multiformis sapientia Dei ostendit, et tunc sumitur ista littera superius dimissa, <I>ut innotescat principatibus et potestatibus</I>, ex qua apparet magnitudo. Et quia etiam in terris sunt principes et potestates, addit <I>in caelestibus</I>, id est in caelo, ubi nos erimus. Notandum est autem hic, quod principatus et potestates sunt duo ordines, qui ex ipsorum nomine praeeminentiam in operando designant. Potestatis ordo ordinatur ad reprimendum impedimenta salutis, sed ordo principatuum praeest et iniungit ad bene exequendum. Quod autem ad ordinem principatus pertineat regulare, patet per illud Ps. LXVII, 26: <I>praevenerunt principes coniuncti psallentibus</I>, et cetera. Item: <I>principes Iuda duces eorum</I>, et cetera. Quod autem ad potestates pertineat reprimere, patet Rom. XIII, 3 s.: <I>vis autem non timere potestatem? Bonum fac, et habebis laudem ex illa; Dei enim minister est tibi in bonum; si autem malefeceris, time. Non enim sine causa gladium portat</I>, et cetera. Magni ergo sunt quibus innotescit: quia sanctis Angelis, per quos diriguntur, et defenduntur sancti.
<td>He discusses those to whom the manifold wisdom of God is revealed in that text (3:10) previously not mentioned: that it <span style="font-weight: bold">may be made known to the principalities and powers</span>, from which its greatness is evident. And, since there are also princes and potentates on earth, he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">in heavenly places</span> meaning in heaven, where we shall be. Note here that Principalities and Powers are two ranks which, by their very names, designate a preeminence in action. The rank of Powers is ordered to check any hindrances to salvation, while the rank of Principalities takes the lead and gives commands that [salvation] might be carried into effect properly. The regulative function of the Principality rank is evident from that text of Psalm 67 (26-28): &#8220;Princes went before joined with singers... The princes of Juda are their leaders.&#8221; The repressive function of the Powers is clear in Romans 13 (3-4): &#8220;Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good; and thou shalt have praise from the same. For he is God&#8217;s minister to thee, for good. But, if thou do that which is evil, fear; for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is God&#8217;s minister; an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.&#8221; <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote17', WPFootnote17 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote17" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote17 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote17\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  Hence, those to whom [the mystery] is made known are eminent; the holy angels by whom the saints are directed and protected.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Per quid autem eis innotescat multiformis sapientia Dei subdit, dicens <I>per Ecclesiam</I>, quod quidem habet magnam difficultatem. Nam Glossa habet, <I>id est per apostolos in Ecclesia praedicantes</I>. Unus quidem intellectus esse potest, quod scilicet Angeli didicerunt ab apostolis, et hoc videtur quamdam rationem habere. Videmus enim quod in caelo inter Angelos superiores, qui immediate a Deo illuminantur, illuminant et docent inferiores Angelos, qui non immediate illuminantur a Deo. Non videtur ergo irrationabile dici quod doceant Angelos apostoli, qui immediate a Deo sunt edocti, secundum illud Io. I, 18: <I>unigenitus filius qui est in sinu patris, ipse enarravit</I>.
<td>The means through which the manifold wisdom of God is made known to them is designated by his saying <span style="font-weight: bold">through the church. </span>This presents no small problem. For a Gloss has &#8220;That is, through the Apostles preaching in the Church.&#8221; <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote18', WPFootnote18 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote18" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote18 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote18\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  This is one way it could be understood, the angels are taught by the Apostles, and this seems to have some grounds to it. For we notice that in heaven the higher angels, who are enlightened immediately by God, illumine and teach the lower angels who are not enlightened immediately by God. Therefore, it does not seem uneasonable that the Apostles should teach the angels since they were taught immediately by God according to John 1 (18): &#8220;The only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.&#8221;
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Sed hoc quidem satis sufficienter dici posset, nisi aliud occurreret. Cum enim in Christo sint duae naturae, divina scilicet et humana, edocti quidem sunt apostoli a Christo immediate quantum ad humanam naturam, Angeli autem immediate naturam divinam vident, etiam inferiores, alias non essent beati, cum in sola visione divinae essentiae rationalis creaturae beatitudo consistat.
<td>However, another factor upsets the sufficiency of this [interpretation]. For there are two natures in Christ, the divine and the human. The Apostles were taught immediately by Christ in his human nature; but the angels immediately intuit the divine nature&#8212;even the lower angels, otherwise they would not be happy, since the beatitude of a rational creature can consist in the vision of the Divine Essence alone. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote19', WPFootnote19 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote19" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote19 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote19\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Non est ergo conveniens, nec ratio aliqua, ut dicamus sanctos qui sunt in patria doceri a quantumcumque perfectis viatoribus. Nam licet inter natos mulierum non surrexit maior Ioanne Baptista, tamen <I>qui minor est in regno caelorum maior est illo</I>, ut dicitur Lc. VII, 28. Dicere autem quod Daemones doceantur ab hominibus, hoc absque praeiudicio credibile est. Sed quod beati qui immediate verbum conspiciunt, quod est speculum sine macula, in quo relucent omnia, a viatoribus doceantur, dici non debet, nec conveniens videtur.
<td>It certainly would be unseemly and absurd for us to maintain that the saints in the fatherland could be taught by even the most perfect of those still on their way [to heaven]. Although among men bom of women none greater than Jqhn the Baptist has arisen, yet &#8220;he that is the lesser in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he&#8221; (Lk. 7:28). To hold that the demons could be instructed by men is, at first glance, credible. But that the blessed could be educated by pilgrims when they immediately behold the Word, the spotless mirror reflecting all being, this should not be held and does not appear proper.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Dicendum est ergo, quod innotuit Angelis per Ecclesiam, id est per apostolos praedicantes, ut dicit Glossa, non quod Angeli hoc didicerint ab eis, sed in eis. Nam, sicut dicit Augustinus super Genesim ad litteram, Deus antequam creaturas crearet, ante, dico, ordine naturae, non ordine temporis, cum secundum tempus simul omnia creata sint, rationes rerum naturalium indidit mentibus Angelorum, quo fit ut Angeli dupliciter res naturales cognoscerent, quia cognoverunt eas in verbo, et haec cognitio dicitur matutina. Item, cognoverunt eas in naturis propriis, et haec dicitur cognitio vespertina.
<td>Therefore, it must be asserted that the angels are instructed <span style="font-weight: bold">through the church, that </span>is, through the apostolic preaching, as the Gloss maintains, in such a way that they are not taught by the Apostles, but in them. Augustine remarks, in his <i>Super Genesim ad Litteram</i>, <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote20', WPFootnote20 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote20" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote20 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote20\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  that before God created [material] beings, he impressed on the angelic minds the intelligible patterns of natural realities. The &#8220;before&#8221; designating the order of nature and not of time, since from the standpoint of time everything was created together. As a result, angels know natural things in two ways. They know them in the Word, and this is termed their morning knowledge; and they know them in their own proper natures, this is referred to as their evening knowledge.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Ulterius notandum est, quod sunt quaedam rationes mysteriorum gratiae totam creaturam excedentes, et huiusmodi rationes non sunt inditae mentibus Angelorum, sed in solo Deo sunt occultae. Et ideo Angeli non cognoscunt eas in seipsis, nec etiam in Deo, sed cognoscunt eas secundum quod in effectibus explicantur. Cum igitur rationes pertinentes ad multiformem sapientiam Dei, sint huiusmodi, scilicet in solo Deo absconditae, et postmodum in istis forinsecis effectibus explicatae, manifestum est, quod Angeli eas, nec in seipsis, nec in ipso verbo, nec etiam ab apostolis, nec a viatoribus aliis cognoverunt; sed in ipsis apostolis explicatas, prius in mente divina latentes, cognoverunt. Sicut domus quae est in mente artificis, vel conceptu de domo facienda, nullus scire potest quamdiu latet in mente, nisi solum ille qui solus illabitur animabus, scilicet Deus; sed postquam conceptus est iam in effectu extrinseco explicatus, quia domus iam facta est; sic aliquis de domo iam facta, quae prius latebat in mente artificis, edocetur, non autem edocetur per domum, sed in domo.
<td>Further, there exist certain intelligible patterns [operative in] the mysteries of grace which transcend the whole of creation. These intelligible patterns are not impressed on the angelic minds but are bidden in God alone. Thus the angels do not grasp them in themselves, nor even in God, but only as they unfold in the events [which the mysteries] effect. Now, the intelligible patterns relative to God&#8217;s manifold wisdom belong to this category. They are hidden in God and gradually unfold in external effects. Clearly, therefore, the angels will understand them neither in themselves, nor in the Word, nor by the Apostles or any other wayfarer. Rather, they know [the mysteries of grace] hidden in the Divine Mind as they unfold in the Apostles themselves. This is like the case of a house, or the concept of a house to be built, in the mind of an architect. As long as it remains in his mind it can be known to no one&#8212;except God who alone penetrates into human souls. However, once the concepts are realized externally in the construction, in the house after it is built, anyone can learn from the building what previously was concealed in the architect&#8217;s mind. Yet, they are not taught by the house but in the house. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote21', WPFootnote21 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote21" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote21 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote21\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Unde iam restat ut aliter exponatur hoc quod dicit <I>ut innotescat principatibus</I>, etc., ut illa coniunctio ut accipiatur non causaliter, sed quodammodo consecutive, et legatur sic: <I>illuminare quae sit dispensatio sacramenti absconditi a saeculis in Deo, qui omnia creavit</I>, ita tamen absconditi, <I>ut innotescat principatibus</I>, etc., id est, istud sacramentum ita fuit absconditum in Deo, quod inde innotuit principatibus et potestatibus non ab aeterno, sed a saeculo, quia omnis creatura principium habet; et hoc, non per Ecclesiam terrenam, sed caelestem, quia ibi est vera Ecclesia, quae est mater nostra et ad quam tendimus et a qua nostra Ecclesia militans est exemplata. Et sic ly per, designat ordinem naturae tantum, ut dicatur per Ecclesiam caelestem, id est, de uno in aliud, sicut dicitur: illud factum est notum per totum regnum vel civitatem, quia nova currunt ab uno in alium, secundum quod verba currunt; sicut dicitur Act. c. IX, 42 de suscitatione Thabitae beghinae sancti Petri: <I>notum autem factum est per universam Ioppen, et crediderunt multi</I>, et cetera.
<td>There is still another interpretation of <span style="font-weight: bold">that it may be made known to the principalities and powers </span>in which the conjunction that is not taken causally, but in a certain way, consecutively. Thus it would read: To make known what is the dispensation of the mystery hidden for ages in God who has created all reality; hidden, nonetheless, in such a way that it was made known to Principalities and Powers. The sacrament was concealed in God in such a manner that he later revealed it to the Principalities and Powers, not from eternity but from the time they began to exist, for every creature has a beginning. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote22', WPFootnote22 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote22" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote22 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote22\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  This was not through the earthly Church but through the heavenly one&#8212;the true Church who is our mother and to whom we tend; on her is our militant Church patterned.

<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Magister tamen, aliter recitat lecturam Augustini, hoc modo <I>illuminare quae sit dispensatio</I>, etc., et hoc per Ecclesiam, id est, omnes qui sunt in Ecclesia terrena, sed hoc non est secundum intentionem Augustini. Hic posset quaeri, utrum Angeli a principio mundi cognoverint mysterium incarnationis. Respondet Magister dicens, quod Angelis maioribus notum fuit, sed non minoribus. Unde ipsi, scilicet Angeli minores, interrogant, Is. LXIII, 1: <I>quis est iste qui venit de Edom tinctis vestibus de Bosra?</I> Sed opinio haec est contra beatum Dionysium. Dionysius enim duas interrogationes Angelorum de Christo factas ex sacra Scriptura accipit. Unam ex Ps. XXIII, 8: <I>quis est iste rex gloriae?</I> Item accipit aliam ex Is. LXIII, v. 1: <I>quis est iste, qui venit de Edom?</I> et cetera. Prima autem interrogatio, secundum eum, est inferiorum Angelorum, secunda supremorum; quod patet, quia primae non Deus respondet, sed alius, unde dicit: <I>dominus virtutum ipse est rex gloriae</I>. Secundae vero respondet ipse Deus immediate, unde dicit: <I>ego qui loquor iustitiam, et propugnator sum ad salvandum</I>. Vult ergo Dionysius, quod utrique aliquid ignoraverunt et aliquid sciverunt: quia a principio omnes sciverunt mysterium incarnationis in generali, sed rationes in speciali didicerunt tempore procedente seu processu temporis, secundum quod in effectibus extrinsecis explicabantur.
<td>On the other band, the Teacher <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote23', WPFootnote23 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote23" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote23 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote23\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  comments on the text of Augustine in such a way that &#8220;to enlighten all men, that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God&#8221; (Eph. 3:9) occurs <span style="font-weight: bold">through the Church, </span>that is, to all men who are in the earthly Church. But this is not in accord with Augustine&#8217;s thought. Here it could be asked whether the angels knew of the mystery of the Incarnation from the beginning of the world. The Teacher replies that it was known to the higher angels but not the lower ones. So the lower angels ask: &#8220;Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bosra?&#8221; (Is. 63:1). This opinion contradicts that of Blessed Dionysius who sees in the Holy Scriptures two questions asked by the angels about Christ. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote24', WPFootnote24 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote24" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote24 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote24\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  The first is from Psalm 23 (8): &#8220;Who is this King of Glory?&#8221; and the other is from Isaias 63 (1): Who is this that cometh from Edom?&#8221; According to Dionysius, the first is asked by the lower angels and the second by the higher. He bases this on the fact that God does not reply to the first, but someone else says: &#8220;The Lord of hosts, he is the King of Glory&#8221; (Ps. 23:10). Whereas the second is answered by God immediately: I, that speak justice and am a defender to save&#8221; (Is. 63:1). Hence, Dionysius prefers to say that both were ignorant of some [aspects of the mystery] and knew others. From the beginning all knew the mystery of the Incarnation in a general fashion, but as time passedor in the temporal process&#8212;they learned its detailed intelligible patterns when they were explicated in external events.

<td>About the first he says: Due to the importance and security of my office, which I have through faith in Christ, it happens that I suffer tribulations; but they neither daunt me nor can they tear me away from Christ. &#8220;Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? Or distress? Or famine? Or nakedness? Or danger? Or persecution? Or the sword?&#8221; (Rom. 8:35).

Or, he says <span style="font-weight: bold">for you </span>meaning, for your testing: &#8220;As gold in the furnace he hath proved them, and as a victim of a holocaust he hath received them&#8221; (Wis. 3:6).

Et ideo statim orationem suam ab humilitate incipit, dicens <I>huius rei gratia</I>, scilicet ne deficiatis a fide, <I>flecto genua mea ad patrem</I>, etc., quod est signum humilitatis propter duo.

Quando ergo quis genua flectit, protestatur debilitatem suae virtutis. Et inde est, quod exteriora signa corporalia exhibentur Deo ad conversionem, et exercitium spirituale animae interioris.

<td>Humility makes a prayer worthy of being heard: &#8220;He hath had regard to the prayer of the humble: and he hath not despised their petition&#8221; (Ps. 101:18). And, &#8220;The prayer of him that humbleth himself shall pierce the clouds: and till it come nigh he will not be comforted.&#8221; (Ecclus. 35:21). Therefore, he immediately starts his prayer in humility, saying <span style="font-weight: bold">For this cause </span>that you fail not in the faith <span style="font-weight: bold">I bow my knees to the Father. </span>This is a symbol of humility for two reasons. First, a man belittles himself, in a certain way, when he genuflects, and he subjects himself to the one he genuflects before. In such a way he recognizes his own weakness and insignificance. Secondly, physical strength is present in the knees; in bending them a man confesses openly to his lack of strength. Thus external, physical symbols are shown to God for the purpose of renewing and spiritually training the inner soul. [This is expressed] in the prayer of Manasse: I bend the knee of by heart...&#8221; <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote25', WPFootnote25 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote25" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote25 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote25\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  &#8220;For every knee shall be bowed to me: and every tongue shall swear&#8221; (Is. 45:24).

<td>He describes next the person to whom the prayer is directed, God, whom he portrays in his nearness and in his authority. For from his relationship to us we are encouraged to pray with confidence. In this regard he states <span style="font-weight: bold">to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ </span>and whose children we are also. &#8220;Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights&#8221; (Jas. 1:17). &#8220;Thou, O Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer: from everlasting is thy name&#8221; (Is. 63:16). We are confirmed in the hope of obtaining what we ask for with confidence by his authority since from him <span style="font-weight: bold">all paternity in heaven and earth is named.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Posset dici breviter, quod in caelo, id est in Deo vel in divinis, est paternitas, quae est principium omnis paternitatis. Sed de hac non quaeritur ad praesens, quia cuilibet fideli nota est. Sed quaeritur utrum in caelis, id est utrum in Angelis sit aliqua paternitas.
<td>At this point the question arises if there is any paternity in heaven. A quick answer would be that <span style="font-weight: bold">in heaven</span> means that paternity is present in God and in Divinity, and that this is the source of all fatherhood. But this is not questioned here, it is known to all the faithful. It is asked whether in heaven, that is, in the angels, there is any paternity.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Ad hoc dico quod paternitas est tantum in viventibus et cognoscentibus. Est autem duplex vita. Una secundum actum, alia secundum potentiam. Vita quidem secundum potentiam, est habere opera vitae in potentia. Unde dormiens quantum ad actus exteriores, dicitur vivere in potentia. Vivere autem secundum actum est, quando exercet quis opera vitae in actu. Sic autem non solum qui dat potentiam vitae, pater est eius cui dat; sed qui dat actum vitae, ille etiam pater dici potest. Quicumque ergo inducit aliquem ad aliquem actum vitae, puta ad bene operandum, intelligendum, volendum, amandum, pater eius dici potest. I Cor. IV, 15: <I>nam si decem millia paedagogorum habeatis in Christo, sed non multos patres</I>, et cetera. Cum ergo inter Angelos unus alterum illuminet, perficiat et purget, et isti sint actus hierarchici, manifestum est quod unus Angelus est pater alterius, sicut magister est pater discipuli.
<td>To this I reply that paternity exists only among beings who live and who know. But life is twofold: it is either actual or potential. To possess the vital activities in potency is to be potentially alive; for example, a person who is sleeping is said to be potentially alive in regard to the external actions [he performs when awake]. But when someone actually performs the vital activities, he is alive in act. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote26', WPFootnote26 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote26" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote26 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote26\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  Thus, not only he who transmits the potency to life is the father of him to whom he gives it, but also he who communicates an act of life can be called a father. Therefore, whoever stimulates another to some vital act, whether it be to good activity, to understanding, to willing or loving, can be given the name of father. &#8220;For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers&#8221; (1 Cor. 4:15). Likewise, in the hierarchical acts by which one angel illumines, perfects, and purifies another, it is evident that that angel is the father of the other&#8212;just as a teacher is the father of his disciples.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Utrum autem paternitas, quae est in caelis et in terra, derivetur a paternitate, quae est in divinis, dubitatur. Et videtur quod non; quia nomina sic imponimus secundum quod res nominatas cognoscimus; quidquid autem cognoscimus, est per creaturas, ergo nomina imposita a nobis rebus ipsis, plus et prius conveniunt creaturis quam ipsi Deo.
<td>Some doubt that the fatherhood in heaven and on earth is derived from the paternity which exists in the Divinity. It seems not to be, for we give names in accordance with our knowledge of the reality named. And whatever we do know is through creatures; hence, the names we give to the things themselves are applicable primarily, and to a greater degree, to creatures rather than God.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Respondeo et dico quod nomen alicuius rei nominatae a nobis dupliciter potest accipi, quia vel est expressivum, aut significativum conceptus intellectus, quia voces sunt notae, vel signa passionum, vel conceptuum qui sunt in anima, et sic nomen prius est in creaturis, quam in Deo. Aut inquantum est manifestativum quidditatis rei nominatae exterius, et sic est prius in Deo. Unde hoc nomen paternitas, secundum quod significat conceptionem intellectus nominantis rem, sic per prius invenitur in creaturis quam in Deo, quia per prius creatura innotescit nobis, quam Deus; secundum autem quod significat ipsam rem nominatam, sic per prius est in Deo quam in nobis, quia certe omnis virtus generativa in nobis est a Deo. Et ideo dicit: <I>ex quo omnis paternitas in caelo et in terra nominatur</I>, quasi dicat: paternitas quae est in ipsis creaturis, est quasi nominalis seu vocalis, sed illa paternitas divina, qua pater dat totam naturam filio, absque omni imperfectione, est vera paternitas.
<td>I reply and state that the name of anything we name can be taken in two ways. In one it is expressive or symbolic of an intellectual concept, since words are the marks or signs of the impressions or concepts that are in the soul. In this perspective a name refers to creatures more than to God. However, in the second [the name] discloses the quiddity of the external object which is named; thus it will refer more to God. Therefore, the word <span style="font-weight: bold">paternity, </span>when it signifies a concept formed by our intellect as it is naming a thing, will primarily be applicable to creatures instead of God since creatures are more known to us than God. But when it signifies the reality itself which has been named, then [this reality] is primarily in God rather than in us. For certainly all the power to procreate present in us is from God. So he says <span style="font-weight: bold">of whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named </span>as though to affirm: The fatherhood present in creatures is, as it were, nominal or vocal; but the divine fatherhood by which the Father communicates his whole nature to the Son without any imperfection, this is true paternity.

<br>Secondly, he shows through whom he can ask for what he desires (3:16b).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Dicit ergo: dico quod peto ne deficiatis, sed stetis viriliter.

<td>Thus he says: I ask that you do not give up, but be steadfast like men. Yet I know that by yourselves you cannot achieve this without God&#8217;s gift, so I beg <span style="font-weight: bold">that he would grant it to you</span> since &#8220;every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights&#8221; (Jas. 1:17). He will do this <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the riches of his glory</span>, that is, in accord with his overflowing majesty and grandeur. &#8220;Glory and riches are in his house&#8221; (Ps. 111:3), and &#8220;With me are riches and glory&#8221; (Prov. 8:18). Riches, I say, which will cause you to <span style="font-weight: bold">be strengthened with might</span>. &#8220;It is he that giveth strength to the weary, and increaseth force and might to them that are not&#8221; (Is. 40:29). This is for <span style="font-weight: bold">the inward man</span> because a man is overcome easily by his enemy if be is not inwardly fortified. [God must] &#8220;establish him and strengthen him with judgment and with justice, from henceforth and forever&#8221; (Is. 9:7).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Tunc resumatur illa particula interposita, scilicet <I>per spiritum</I>, in qua ostendit per quid obtinere potest quod petit. Ipse enim spiritus, qui roborat, est spiritus fortitudinis et est causa non deficiendi in tribulationibus, quem obtinemus per fidem quae est fortissima: quia fides est substantia rerum sperandarum, id est facit in nobis subsistere res sperandas. Unde I Petr. V, 9: <I>cui resistite fortes in fide</I>. Et ideo subiungit <I>habitare Christum per fidem</I>, et hoc <I>in cordibus vestris</I>. I Petr. III, 15: <I>dominum autem Christum sanctificate in cordibus vestris</I>.
<td>Inserted in the above is the phrase <span style="font-weight: bold">by his Spirit</span> indicating through whom petitions are granted. The Spirit himself fortifies, he is the Spirit of fortitude, and is the source of our not yielding under sufferings. We receive him through a faith which is most strong because it is the substance of the realities we hope for&#8212;that is, it makes these desired realities exist within us. Whence I Peter 5 (9) [concerning the devil]: &#8220;Whom resist ye, strong in faith.&#8221; And Paul adds <span style="font-weight: bold">that Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts</span>. &#8220;Sanctify the Lord Christ in, your hearts&#8221; (1 Pet. 3:15).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Per quod? Dico quod non solum per fidem, quae, ut donum est fortissima, sed etiam per charitatem quae est in sanctis. Et ideo subdit <I>in charitate radicati et fundati</I>. I Cor. XIII, 7: <I>omnia suffert, omnia credit, omnia sperat, omnia sustinet, charitas numquam excidit</I>. Cant. ult.: <I>fortis est ut mors dilectio</I>. Unde sicut arbor sine radice, et domus sine fundamento de facili ruit, ita spirituale aedificium, nisi sit in charitate fundatum et radicatum, durare non potest.
<td>With what? I claim that it should not only be through faith, which as a gift is the strongest, but also through the charity that is in the saints. That you may <span style="font-weight: bold">be rooted and founded in a charity </span>which &#8220;beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never falleth away&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:7-8). &#8220;For love is strong as death...&#8221; (Cant. 8:6). A tree without roots, or a house lacking a foundation are destroyed easily. In a similar manner, a spiritual edifice not rooted and founded in charity cannot last.

<td>Previously the Apostle revealed the object of his petition or prayer in behalf of the Ephesians, a strengthening of spirit in faith and charity (3:14). Consequently, he here shows the fruit of this strengthening through faith and charity; it is a certain type of knowledge. He sets forth:
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td><p style=margin-left:.3in>Ideo primo proponit ipsam notitiam;<br>secundo ipsius notitiae et cognitionis efficaciam, ibi <I>ut impleamini in omnem plenitudinem Dei</I>.

<br>Secondly, the effective power of this awareness or knowledge (3:19b).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Dicit ergo: ita sitis, charissimi, <I>in charitate radicati et fundati, ut possitis comprehendere</I>, et cetera. Quod quidem dupliciter legi potest. Primo modo, ut magis sequamur intentionem apostoli.
<td>He says: You ought to be so rooted and founded in charity, dearly beloved, that <span style="font-weight: bold">you may be able to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth. </span>This can be read in two ways. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote27', WPFootnote27 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote27" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote27 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote27\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  In the first way we are more in accord with the Apostle&#8217;s thought.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Sciendum est ergo quod tam in futuro quam in praesenti cognitio Dei est nobis necessaria; nam in futuro gaudebimus et de cognitione Dei et de cognitione assumptae humanitatis. Io. XVII, 3: <I>haec est vita aeterna, ut, cognoscant</I>, et cetera. Io. X, 9: <I>ingredietur</I>, scilicet in contemplatione divinitatis, <I>et egredietur</I>, scilicet in contemplatione humanitatis, <I>et pascua inveniet</I>. Et quia fides est inchoatio illius futurae cognitionis, quia <I>est substantia rerum sperandarum</I>, etc., ut dicitur Hebr. XI, v. 1 quasi iam in nobis res sperandas per modum cuiusdam inchoationis facit subsistere. Inde est quod fides nostra in his duobus consistit, scilicet in divinitate et humanitate Christi. I Cor. II, 2: <I>non enim iudicavi me scire aliquid inter vos, nisi Iesum Christum</I>, et cetera. Secundum hoc ergo
<td>The knowledge of God is necessary for us both in the future life and in the present. For in the future we shall rejoice in our knowledge of God and in our perception of the humanity [the Son] assumed. &#8220;Now this is eternal life: that they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent&#8221; (Jn. 17:3). [Our Lord compared himself to a door; men will] &#8220;go in&#8221; to contemplate the divinity, and will &#8220;go out&#8221; in the contemplation of the humanity, &#8220;and shall find pastures&#8221; (Jn. 10:9). Faith inaugurates that future knowledge; it is &#8220;the substance of things hoped for&#8221; (Heb. 11:1), already making the realities we desire exist within us in an inchoate manner. For this reason our faith consists in the divinity and humanity of Christ. &#8220;For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ; and him crucified&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:2). In accord with this he discusses:
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td><p style=margin-left:.3in>primo praemittit eis cognitionem divinitatis;<br>secundo cognitionem mysteriorum humanitatis, ibi <I>scire etiam supereminentem scientiae</I>, et cetera.
<td><p style=margin-left:.3in>First, the knowledge of divinity.
<br>Secondly, the knowledge of the mysteries of the humanity (3: 19).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Cognitionem autem divinitatis manifestat eis sub his verbis <I>ut possitis</I>, etc., quasi dicat: corroboramini per fidem et charitatem, quia si sic estis, pervenietis ad vitam aeternam, ubi habebitis Deum praesentem et perfecte eum cognoscetis. Quod autem Deus manifestetur amanti, patet Io. XIV, 21: <I>qui diligit me, diligetur a patre meo, et ego diligam eum, et manifestabo ei meipsum</I>; quod vero manifestetur credenti, patet, prout dicitur Is. VII, 9, secundum aliam litteram: <I>nisi credideritis, non intelligetis</I>. Oportet enim ut secundum fidem et charitatem corroboremini, ut possitis comprehendere.
<td>He reveals the knowledge of the divinity to them with the words: <span style="font-weight: bold">that you may be able to comprehend, with all the saints</span>... As though he said: Be strong in faith and charity for if you are, you will gain life eternal where you will enjoy God&#8217;s presence and perfectly know him. It is evident from John 14 (21) that God reveals himself to one who loves: &#8220;He that loveth me shall be loved of my Father; and I will love him and will manifest myself to him.&#8221; It is also clear that he shows himself to one who believes, as a variant reading of Isaias 7 (9) puts it: &#8220;Unless you believe, you will not understand. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote28', WPFootnote28 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote28" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote28 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote28\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  You must be fortified by faith and charity in order that you might be able to comprehend.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Ubi sciendum est quod comprehendere quandoque ponitur pro includere, et tunc oportet quod comprehendens contineat in se totaliter comprehensum. Quandoque autem ponitur pro apprehendere, et tunc dicit remotionem distantiae et insinuat propinquitatem. Primo autem modo a nullo intellectu creato Deus comprehendi potest. Iob XI, 7: <I>forsitan vestigia Dei comprehendes, et usque ad perfectum omnipotentem reperies?</I> Quasi dicat: non, quia sic posset eum perfecte cognoscere quantum cognoscibilis est. Et de hac cognitione non intelligitur quod dicitur <I>ut possitis comprehendere</I>, sed<br>secundo modo. Et est una de tribus dotibus, et de hac loquitur apostolus, cum dicit <I>ut possitis comprehendere</I>, id est Deum habere praesentem et praesentialiter cognoscere. Phil. c. III, 12: <I>sequor autem si quomodo comprehendam, in quo</I>, et cetera. Et haec comprehensio est communis omnibus sanctis eius. Ideo subdit <I>cum omnibus sanctis</I>. Ps. CXLIX, 9: <I>gloria haec est omnibus sanctis eius</I>. Talibus autem dicitur illud I Cor. IX, 24: <I>sic currite ut comprehendatis</I>, et cetera. <I>Quae sit latitudo</I>, et cetera.
<td>It should be noted that sometimes <span style="font-weight: bold">to comprehend </span>means &#8220;to enclose,&#8221; and then it is necessary that the comprehending totally contains within itself what is comprehended. At other times it means &#8220;to apprehend,&#8221; and then it affirms a remoteness or distance and yet implies proximity. No created intellect can comprehend God in the first manner. &#8220;Peradventure thou wilt comprehend the steps of God, and wilt find out the Almighty perfectly?&#8221; (Job 11:7). The answer implied is, No. For one could know him perfectly to the extent that [one knew all] that could be known about him. And this type of knowledge is not referred to in <span style="font-weight: bold">that you may comprehend</span>, but rather the second kind. This latter is one of the three dowries, <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote29', WPFootnote29 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote29" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote29 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote29\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  and it is of it that the Apostle speaks here when he says <span style="font-weight: bold">that you may comprehend, </span>meaning, that you may enjoy the presence of God and know him intimately. &#8220;Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect; but I follow after, if I may by any means apprehend [<i>comprehendam</i>],<i> </i>wherein I am also apprehended by Christ Jesus&#8221; (Phil. 3:12). Such comprehension is common to all his saints; so he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">with all the saints. </span>&#8220;This glory is to all his saints&#8221; (Ps. 149:9). &#8220;So run that you may apprehend [<i>comprehendatis</i>]&#8221; (1 Cor. 9:24).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Notandum quod verba ista videntur ortum habere ex verbis Iob XI, 7: <I>forsan</I>, inquit, <I>vestigia Dei comprehendes?</I> Quasi dicat: incomprehensibilis est; huius autem incomprehensibilitatis causam assignat, dicens: <I>excelsior caelo est, et quid facies? Profundior Inferno est, et unde cognosces? Longior terra mensura eius, et latior mari</I>. Ex quo videtur quod Iob ostendat eum esse comprehensibilem, attribuens ei quadruplicem differentiam dimensionum. His enim verbis alludens apostolus dicit <I>ut possitis comprehendere, quae sit latitudo</I>, etc.; quasi dicat: habeatis tantam fidem et charitatem, ut possitis tandem comprehendere quod comprehensibile est. Et hoc modo exponit Dionysius.
<td>Note that the words <span style="font-weight: bold">what is the breadth and length and height and depth </span>seem to owe their origin to the passage in Job 11 (7-9). &#8220;Peradventure,&#8221; he says, &#8220;thou wilt comprehend the steps of God?&#8221; As if he stated that God is incomprehensible. Then he gives the reason for this incomprehensibility by saying: &#8220;He is higher than the heaven, and what wilt thou do? He is deeper than hell, and how wilt thou know? The measure of him is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.&#8221; Yet from this it appears that Job, in attributing the four different dimensions to him, shows that he is comprehensible. Alluding to these words the Apostle asserts that you may <span style="font-weight: bold">be able to comprehend what is the breadth and length and height and depth; </span>as though he said: May you possess sufficient faith and charity that you might comprehend him to the extent that he is able to be comprehended. Dionysius explains the text in this way. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote30', WPFootnote30 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote30" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote30 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote30\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Non est tamen aliquo modo intelligendum has dimensiones corporaliter esse in Deo, quia <I>spiritus est Deus</I>, ut dicitur Io. IV, 24. Sunt tamen in Deo metaphorice. Unde per latitudinem designatur dimensio seu extensio virtutis, et sapientiae divinae super omnia. Eccli. I, 10: <I>effudit illam</I>, scilicet sapientiam, <I>super omnia opera sua</I>. Per longitudinem designatur aeterna eius duratio. Ps. ci, 13: <I>tu autem, domine, in aeternum permanes</I>, et cetera. Ps. XCII, 5: <I>domum tuam, domine, decet sanctitudo in longitudinem dierum</I>. Per sublimitatem vel celsitudinem vero, perfectio et nobilitas naturae eius, quae in infinitum excedit creaturam. Ps. CXII, 4: <I>excelsus super omnes gentes dominus. Et profundum</I>, id est incomprehensibilitas sapientiae eius. Eccle. VII, 25: <I>alta profunditas</I>, scilicet sapientiae divinae, <I>quis inveniet eam?</I> Sic ergo patet quod finis fidei et charitatis nostrae est ut perveniamus ad perfectam fidei cognitionem, qua cognoscamus infinitam suae virtutis extensionem, aeternam et infinitam eius durationem, suae perfectissimae naturae celsitudinem, suae sapientiae profunditatem et incomprehensibilitatem, eo modo sicut est attingendum.
<td>Under no pretext should these dimensions be conceived as physically applicable to God, &#8220;God is spirit&#8221; (Jn. 4:24). They are in God metaphorically. <span style="font-weight: bold">Breadth</span> designates the dimension or extension of his power and divine wisdom over all being. &#8220;And he poured her out,&#8221; namely wisdom, &#8220;upon all his works&#8221; (Ecclus. 1:10). By <span style="font-weight: bold">length</span> his eternal duration is signified: &#8220;But thou, O Lord, endurest forever&#8221; (Ps. 101:13), and &#8220;holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, unto length of days&#8221; (Ps. 92:5). <span style="font-weight: bold">Height</span> or loftiness denotes the perfection and nobility of his nature which infinitely exceeds all creation: &#8220;The Lord is high above all nations: and his glory above the heavens&#8221; (Ps. 112:4). In <span style="font-weight: bold">depth</span> the incomprehensibility of his wisdom is intimated: &#8220;It is a great depth,&#8221; this divine wisdom, &#8220;who shall find it out?&#8221; (Eccl. 7:25). Clearly, therefore, the fulfillment of our faith and charity is to arrive at a perfect knowledge of the faith, by it we shall know, to the degree we can attain to it, the infinite extent of his power, the unbounded eternity of his duration, the loftiness of his most perfect nature, and the incomprehensibility and depth of his wisdom.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Consequenter, quia adhuc alia cognitio est necessaria, scilicet cognitio mysteriorum humanitatis, ideo subdit <I>scire etiam supereminentem scientiae</I>, et cetera. Ubi sciendum est quod quidquid est in mysterio redemptionis humanae et incarnationis Christi, totum est opus charitatis. Nam quod incarnatum est, ex charitate processit. Supra II, 4: <I>propter nimiam charitatem suam qua dilexit nos</I>, et cetera. Quia vero mortuus fuit, ex charitate processit Io. XV, 13: <I>maiorem hac dilectionem nemo habet</I>, etc.; infra V, 2: <I>Christus dilexit nos, et tradidit semetipsum pro nobis oblationem et hostiam Deo</I>. Propter hoc dicit Gregorius: <I>o inaestimabilis dilectio charitatis. Ut servum redimeres, filium tradidisti</I>. Et ideo scire charitatem Christi, est scire omnia mysteria incarnationis Christi et redemptionis nostrae, quae ex immensa charitate Dei processerunt, quae quidem charitas excedit omnem intellectum creatum et omnium scientiam, cum sit incomprehensibilis cogitatu. Et ideo dicit <I>supereminentem scientiae</I>, scilicet naturali et omnem intellectum creatum excedentem, Phil. IV, 7: <I>et pax Dei, quae exsuperat omnem sensum; charitatem Christi</I>, id est, quam Deus pater fecit per Christum. II Cor. V, 19: <I>Deus erat in Christo mundum reconcilians sibi</I>.
<td>Next, since further knowledge is also necessary&#8212;a knowledge of the mysteries of the humanity&#8212;he goes on <span style="font-weight: bold">to know also the charity of Christ. </span>For whatever occurred in the mystery of human redemption and Christ&#8217;s incarnation was the work of love. He was born out of charity: &#8220;For his exceeding charity wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins, bath quickened us together in Christ&#8221; (Eph. 2:4-5). That he died also sprang from charity: &#8220;Greater love than this no man bath, that a man lay down his life for his friends&#8221; (Jn. 15:13). And &#8220;Christ also bath loved us and bath delivered hftnself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God&#8221; (Eph. 5:2). On this account St. Gregory exclaimed: &#8220;O the incalculable love of your charity! To redeem slaves you delivered up your Son.&#8221; <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote31', WPFootnote31 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote31" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote31 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote31\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  It follows that to know Christ&#8217;s love is to know all the mysteries of Christ&#8217;s Incarnation and our Redemption. These have poured out from the immense charity of God; a charity exceeding every created intelligence and the [combined] knowledge of all of them because it cannot be grasped in thought. Thus he says <span style="font-weight: bold">which surpasseth all</span> natural <span style="font-weight: bold">knowledge</span> and every created intellect: &#8220;The peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus&#8221; (Phil. 4:7). For <span style="font-weight: bold">the charity of Christ </span>is [the manifestation of] what God the Father has accomplished through Christ: &#8220;God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:19).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Alio modo potest legi, ut referatur ad perfectionem charitatis nostrae, quasi dicat: corroboramini <I>in charitate radicati et fundati</I>, et hoc <I>ut possitis comprehendere</I>, non solum cognoscere, <I>cum omnibus sanctis</I>, quia hoc donum, scilicet charitatis, commune est omnibus, cum nullus possit esse sanctus sine charitate, ut dicitur Ephes. c. III. <I>Possitis</I>, inquam, comprehendere <I>quae sit latitudo</I>, scilicet charitatis, quae se extendit usque ad inimicos. Ps. CXVIII, 96: <I>latum mandatum tuum nimis</I>. Lata est enim charitas ad suam diffusionem. Ps. XVII, 20: <I>eduxit me in latitudinem dominus. Longitudo</I> autem eius attenditur quantum ad sui perseverantiam, quia numquam deficit, sed hic incipit et perficitur in gloria. I Cor. XIII, v. 8: <I>charitas numquam excidit</I>. Cant. ult.: <I>aquae multae non potuerunt extinguere charitatem. Sublimitas</I> autem eius attenditur quantum ad intentionem caelestium, ut scilicet Deus non diligatur propter temporalia, quia huiusmodi charitas esset infirma, sed ut diligatur propter se tantum. Iob XL, v. 5: <I>in sublime erigere, et esto gloriosus. Profundum</I> vero attenditur quantum ad originem ipsius charitatis. Nam hoc quod Deum diligimus, non est ex nobis, sed a spiritu sancto, quia, ut dicitur Rom. V, 5, <I>charitas Dei diffusa est in cordibus nostris per spiritum sanctum</I>, et cetera. Hoc ergo quod unus habet charitatem longam, latam, sublimem et profundam, et alius non, venit ex profundo divinae praedestinationis. Eccli. I, 2: <I>profundum abyssi quis dimensus est</I>.
<td>The other manner in which this passage (vv. 18-19) can be read is in reference to the perfection of our charity. As though he stated: Be strong, rooted and founded in charity, that you may comprehend&#8212;and not merely know&#8212;with all the saints; since this gift of charity is common to all, no one can be holy without charity, as the third chapter of Ephesians indicates. <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote32', WPFootnote32 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote32" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote32 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote32\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  <span style="font-weight: bold">May you</span>, I say, <span style="font-weight: bold">comprehend what is the breadth </span>of charity, extending, as it does, even to one&#8217;s enemies: &#8220;Thy commandment is exceeding broad&#8221; (Ps. 118:96). For charity is broad in its diffusion: &#8220;And the Lord brought me forth into a broad place&#8221; (Ps. 17:20). Its <span style="font-weight: bold">length</span> is seen in its durability, never stopping, it begins in this life and is perfected in glory: &#8220;Charity never falleth away&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:8), and &#8220;Many waters cannot quench charity&#8221; (Cant. 8:7). Its <span style="font-weight: bold">height</span> is perceived in its motivation which is heavenly; God is not loved to obtain temporal advantages&#8212;which love would be sickly&#8212;but be is loved for his own sake alone. &#8220;Set thyself up on high and be glorious&#8221; (job 40:5). <span style="font-weight: bold">Depth</span> signifies the source of charity itself. For our love of God does not spring from ourselves, but from the Holy Spirit, as Romans 5 (5) mentions: &#8220;The charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.&#8221; Hence, for one person to possess a love which is lasting, extensive, sublime and deep, while another person does not, arises out of the depth of divine predestination. And &#8220;who has measured the depth of the abyss?&#8221; (Ecclus. 1:2).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Ergo, <I>ut possitis comprehendere</I>, id est perfecte consequi cum omnibus sanctis, <I>quae sit latitudo</I>, ut extendatur charitas vestra usque ad inimicos, <I>quae sit longitudo</I>, ut scilicet numquam deficiat, <I>quae sit sublimitas</I>, ut scilicet propter seipsum Deus diligatur, et <I>quid sit profundum</I>, scilicet praedestinationis, et cetera.
<td>Thus <span style="font-weight: bold">you may be able to comprehend</span>, in the sense of perfectly attaining to, <span style="font-weight: bold">with all the saints, what is the breadth </span>with which your charity should extend even to enemies, and what is the <span style="font-weight: bold">length</span> during which it never ceases, and its height in loving God for his own sake, and the <span style="font-weight: bold">depth </span>of the divine predestination [from which it springs].
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Sciendum est autem hic quod Christus, in cuius potestate fuit eligere genus mortis quod vellet, quia ex charitate mortem subiit, elegit mortem crucis, in qua praedictae quatuor dimensiones sunt. Ibi est <I>latitudo</I>, scilicet in ligno transverso, cui affixae sunt manus, quia opera nostra debent per charitatem dilatari usque ad inimicos. Ps. XVII, 20: <I>eduxit me in latitudinem dominus</I>. Ibi est <I>longitudo</I> in ligno erecto, cui innititur totum corpus, quia charitas debet esse perseverativa, quae sustinet et salvat hominem. Matth. X, 22: <I>qui autem perseveraverit usque in finem, hic salvus erit</I>. Ibi est <I>sublimitas</I> in ligno superiori, cui caput inhaeret, quia spes nostra debet elevari ad aeterna et divina. I Cor. XI, 3: <I>caput viri Christus est</I>. Ibi etiam est <I>profundum</I> in ligno quod latet sub terra et sustinet crucem, et tamen non videtur, quia profundum amoris divini sustinet nos, nec tamen videtur; quia ratio praedestinationis ut dictum est excedit intellectum nostrum.
<td>At this point it should be realized that it was within Christ&#8217;s power to choose what type of death he wanted. And since he underwent death out of charity, he chose the death of the cross in which the aforesaid four dimensions are present. The cross-beam has <span style="font-weight: bold">breadth</span> and to it his hands were nailed because through charity our good works ought to stretch out even to adversaries: &#8220;The Lord brought me forth into a broad place&#8221; (Ps. 17:20). The trunk of the cross has <span style="font-weight: bold">length</span> against which the whole body leans since charity ought to be enduring, thus sustaining and saving man: &#8220;He that shall persevere unto the end, he shall be saved&#8221; (Mt. 10:22). The projection of wood [above the cross-beam], against which the head is thrown back, has <span style="font-weight: bold">height</span> since our hope must rise toward the eternal and the divine: &#8220;The head of every man is Christ&#8221; (1 Cor. 11:3). The cross is braced by its <span style="font-weight: bold">depth </span>which lies concealed beneath the ground; it is not seen because the depth of the divine love which sustains us is not visible insofar as the plans of predestination, as was said above, are beyond our intelligence.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Sic ergo debemus comprehendere virtutem charitatis nostrae et Christi, et adhuc scire charitatem Christi supereminentem scientiae, scilicet humanae, quia nullus potest scire quantum Christus dilexit nos, vel scire etiam charitatem scientiae Christi, quae habetur cum scientia Christi. Charitatem, dico, supereminentem, scilicet alii charitati, quae est sine scientia.
<td>In this manner we should comprehend the power of our love, and of Christ&#8217;s, realizing that his surpasses human understanding. For no one could know how much Christ has loved us; nor can one know the charity of the knowledge of Christ, [that love] which is possessed with knowledge of Christ. I hold that such charity surpasses a love which is without knowledge.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Sed numquid est verum quod charitas quae est cum scientia superemineat charitati quae est sine scientia? Et videtur quod non, quia sic malus theologus esset supereminentioris charitatis quam sancta vetula. Respondeo. Dico quod hoc intelligitur de scientia afficiente: nam ex vi cognitionis inducitur ad magis diligendum, quia, quanto Deus magis cognoscitur, tanto et magis diligitur. Propter quod petebat Augustinus: <I>noverim te, noverim me</I>. Vel hoc dicitur propter quosdam qui habent zelum Dei, sed non secundum scientiam. Talium enim charitati supereminet charitas, cum habetur praedicta scientia Christi.
<td>Is it not correct that a charity with knowledge is more eminent than a charity without knowledge? It seems that it is not, for then a wicked theologian would have a charity of greater dignity than a holy old woman. I reply that what is discussed here is a knowledge which exerts its influence [on one&#8217;s life and conduct]. For the force of the knowledge stimulates one to love more since the more God is known, so much the more is he loved. For this reason Augustine used to ask: &#8220;That I may know You and know myself.&#8221; <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote33', WPFootnote33 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a> <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">   if( bInlineFloats )   {     document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote33" class="WPFloatStyle">' );     document.write( WPFootnote33 );     document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote33\')">Close</a>' );     document.write( '</span>' );   } </script>  Or, this is stated here on account of some who possess zeal for God &#8220;but not according to knowledge&#8221; (Rom. 10:2). A charity coupled with the above mentioned knowledge of Christ surpasses the love of such people.
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Consequenter cum dicit <I>ut impleamini</I>, etc., ponit cognitionis divinae efficaciam, dicens <I>ut impleamini in omnem plenitudinem Dei</I>, id est ut habeatis perfectam participationem omnium donorum Dei, ut scilicet hic habeatis plenitudinem virtutum, et postea beatitudinis, quae quidem efficit charitas. Eccli. XXIV, 26: <I>transite ad me, omnes qui concupiscitis me</I>, et cetera.
<td>Next he speaks of the efficacy of a knowledge of the divine. <span style="font-weight: bold">That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God, </span>that is, that you might enjoy a perfect participation in all God&#8217;s gifts. In other words, that you might possess the fullness of the virtues here, and beatitude in the next life&#8212;charity accomplishes just that. &#8220;Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits&#8221; (Ecclus. 24-26).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Consequenter sequitur illa pars <I>ei autem qui potens</I>, et cetera. In qua apostolus agit Deo gratias de suae petitionis exauditione. Circa quod tria facit,
<td>After this, the Apostle gives thanks to God for hearing his prayer (v. 20). In reference to this he does three things:
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td><p style=margin-left:.3in>quia primo ponit potestatem Dei, qua postulata concedit;<br>secundo potestatis exemplum, ibi <I>secundum virtutem quae operatur in nobis</I>, etc.;<br>tertio materiam gratiarum actionis, ibi <I>ipsi gloria</I>, et cetera.
<td><p style=margin-left:.3in>First, he mentions the power of God with which he grants petitions.
<br>Secondly, he gives an example of that power (3:20b).
<br>Thirdly, he mentions what prompts his thanksgiving (3:21).
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Potestatem autem Dei describit infinitam, dicens <I>ei autem</I>, scilicet Deo Christo et Deo patri, <I>qui potens est omnia facere</I>, et cetera. Ex. XV, 3: <I>omnipotens nomen eius</I>. Rom. ult.: <I>ei autem qui potens est vos confirmare iuxta Evangelium</I>, et cetera. Et hoc <I>superabundanter</I> facere in nobis omnia quam sciamus petere per affectum, aut intelligere per intellectum, et hoc est quod dicit <I>quam petimus, aut intelligimus</I>.

Nam nec affectus, nec intellectus humanus potuissent considerare, vel intelligere, vel petere a Deo quod fieret homo et homo efficeretur Deus et consors naturae divinae, quae tamen secundum virtutem operatur in nobis, et hoc in incarnatione filii sui. II Petr. I, 4: <I>ut per hoc efficiamini divinae consortes naturae</I>. Unde de his dicitur Eccli. XVIII, 2: <I>quis sufficiet enarrare opera illius?</I> Quis enim investigabit magnalia illius, virtutem autem magnitudinis quis annuntiabit?
<td>He gives an example of this profusion within us [of the divine power], saying <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the power that worketh in us. </span>As if he had stated: It becomes apparent once we consider what he has wrought in us men. For the human mind and will could never imagine, understand or ask that God become man, and that man become God and a sharer in the divine nature. But he has done this in us by his power, and it was accomplished in the Incarnation of his Son. &#8220;That through this you may be made partakers of the divine nature&#8221; (2 Pet. 1:4). Concerning these matters Ecclesiasticus 18 (2-4) says: &#8220;Who is able to declare his works? For who shall search out his glorious acts? And who shall shew forth the power of his majesty? Or, who shall be able to declare his mercy?&#8221;
<tr style=text-align:justify valign=top><td>Vel <I>operatus est in nobis</I>, scilicet apostolis, quibus dedit gratiam evangelizandi <I>investigabiles divitias Christi, et illuminare omnes quae sit dispensatio sacramenti absconditi a saeculis in Deo</I>, ut supra eodem cap. et ibi dictum est.
