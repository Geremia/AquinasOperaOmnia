      ;>respondeo dicendum, quod quidam dicunt, quod peccatum primi hominis et 
      peccatum daemonis non fuit neque in patrem neque in filium neque in 
      spiritum sanctum; hae enim non sunt differentiae peccati absolute accepti, 
      sed peccati quod contingit in natura corrupta. infirmitas enim et 
      ignorantia et malitia, ex peccato naturam corruptam consequuntur. sed 
      sciendum, quod quamvis infirmitas nullo modo in natura integra inveniri 
      possit, et ita nec peccatum in patrem: tamen ignorantia aliquo modo in 
      natura integra inveniri potuit, non secundum quod ignorantia dicitur 
      privative, sed secundum quod dicitur negative: sic enim est defectus 
      consequens intellectum creatum, inquantum creatus est: ex hoc enim deficit 
      a perfecto lumine intellectus increati, ut non omnia sciat, vel saltem non 
      omnia actu consideret: et ex tali nescientia peccatum proveniens, peccatum 
      in filium dici potest. et similiter etiam malitia ex qua peccatum in 
      spiritum sanctum procedit, non oportet quod sit poena, sed est aliquis 
      actus peccati, ut supra dictum est; unde et in natura integra potuit esse 
      peccatum in filium et in spiritum sanctum. sciendum tamen, quod primus 
      actus peccati primi hominis et angeli non fuit in spiritum sanctum, prout 
      peccatum in spiritum sanctum est speciale peccatum: quod patet ex ipso 
      objecto peccati: uterque enim peccavit, altitudinem propriam appetendo. et 
      ideo quantum ad genus peccati fuit peccatum superbiae; sed quantum ad 
      circumstantiam peccati utrumque fuit peccatum in filium: quia uterque 
      peccavit ex hoc quod non consideravit ea quae consideranda erant ad 
      evitationem peccati; non autem fuit peccatum primum eorum ex hoc quod 
      propria voluntate repugnarent spei, vel alicui hujusmodi, sicut fit in 
      peccato in spiritum sanctum. </FONT></TD>

      ;><I>Response: </I>Some say that the sin of the first man and that of the 
      demons were not against the Father, the Son or the Holy Spirit. For these 
      are not absolutely accepted as the differences of sin, but of sin which 
      belongs to (our) fallen nature. For weakness, ignorance and malice follow 
      upon the fallen nature by reason of sin. But it should be recognized that 
      although weakness in no way can arise within an unfallen nature, and that 
      likewise neither can the sin against the Father, nevertheless, ignorance, 
      in a certain way, can arise in the unfallen nature, that is, not in so far 
      as ignorance is said privatively, but rather as it is said negatively. For 
      it is a defect following upon a created intellect in as much as it is 
      created. By reason of this, the created intellect prescinds from the 
      perfect light of the uncreated intellect so that it does not know 
      everything, or at least it does not actually consider all things. By 
      reason of this kind of unknowing, a sin which arises can be called a sin 
      against the Son. In like fashion, too, malice, by reason of which the sin 
      against the Holy Spirit arises, is not necessarily a penalty, but is, 
      rather, an act of sin, as was said above. Whence, there could be, in the 
      unfallen state, a sin against the Son and the Holy Spirit. It should be 
      noted, however, that the first act of the sin of both the first man and 
      angel was not against the Holy Spirit, as the sin against the Holy Spirit 
      is a definite (kind of) sin, which is evident by reason of the very object 
      of this sin. For both sinned by desiring (in a disordered way) their own 
      greatness. With respect, then, to the genus of sin, there was the sin of 
      pride. But with respect to the circumstance of sin, both committed a sin 
      against the Son because both sinned by reason of the fact that they did 
      not consider those things which were to be considered so as to avoid sin. 
      However, their first sin did not come about in so far as they rejected 
      hope by their own will, or some other like thing, as is the case in the 
      sin against the Holy Spirit.</FONT></TD></TR>

      ;>[<I>Additional material:</I> (He who has blasphemed against the Holy 
      Spirit, will not be forgiven), either now or in the future. This is so 
      said because certain sins (committed) in the future are pardoned, as 
      certain venial sins are (as Gregory states), not only with respect to the 
      penalty, but also with regard to the blame. I do not speak (thus) so that 
      anyone might pray on (such a sinner's) behalf. If the sin unto death is 
      understood as the sin against the Holy Spirit, especially as this sin 
      requires final impenitence, according to this view, it is understood that 
      no one prays on behalf of such people. For whoever perdures in mortal sin 
      up to death is not helped by prayers afterwards. If, however, the sin 
      against the Holy Spirit be taken according to another view, as it does not 
      require final impenitence, it is understood that one does not pray for 
      him, that is, in any such way. For a conversion of such a kind is, as it 
      were, miraculous. Hence, not just any person prays for miracles to be 
      performed, but rather great and holy men. Likewise, for a conversion of 
      that sort (it is fit that only the great and holy pray for such).

      ;>Nevertheless according to the form of the words (that is to say, with an 
      emphasis upon the particular words used in this context, for this purpose: 
      <I>formam verborum</I> - see ST III.72.3.ad2, and III.78.1.ad1), prayer is 
      not prohibited on his behalf that these things (for which one prays) may 
      come to be. But it is argued that the command that one ought to pray on 
      behalf of his faithful neighbors is not to be extended to sinners of this 
      kind (namely sins against the Holy Spirit). For on account of the enormity 
      of their sin, they merit this (kind of treatment) so that they be removed 
      from the faithful, just as was the case with the foreigner and the 
      publican. He, who has blasphemed against the Holy Spirit, will not be 
      forgiven either now or in the future. The Gloss at Matthew 12 says that 
      blasphemy is forgiven, but not the spirit of blasphemy. For blasphemy 
      denotes a kind of sin absolutely which happens whenever one sins by reason 
      of weakness, as when someone blasphemes by reason of the passion of anger, 
      and whenever one sins by reason of ignorance, as when those err when they 
      speak badly about matters relating to God. But the spirit of blasphemy is 
      the will to commit blasphemy, when, namely, one blasphemes by reason of a 
      definite malice. And then, the sin against the Holy Spirit (is committed). 
      It is befitting to discuss whether obstinacy is one sin, and impenitence 
      another. The solution of this question is evident according to the 
      distinction concerning impenitence put forth previously. For if 
      impenitence is understood as the active duration in obstinacy up to death, 
      it is not a sin distinct from obstinacy, but (differs only with respect 
      to) its circumstance. If, however, impenitence is understood according to 
      the one who puts forth the intention of not repenting, in this way it is a 
      different sin.]</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
